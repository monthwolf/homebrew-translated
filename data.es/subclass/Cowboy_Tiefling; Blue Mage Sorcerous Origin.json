Clothed in distinctive blue-and-black jubbahs and wielding curved blades, the Blue Mages are feared for their ability to harness a creature's strength and add it to their own. Blue magic is an art that allows a person to mimic the awesome powers of monsters and far exceed the normal boundaries of mortals.",

And while the magical process of absorbing a monster's essence into oneself has reduced the occurrence of physical incidents, there is an increased danger of a blue mage succumbing mentally and spiritually to the beast within...",

There is even talk of a blue mage who absorbed the essence of an undead creature and can no longer be released from his mortal coil.",
