						"Ask ten bards from any part of the realms where bardcraft came from, and you'll more than likely get 12 distinctly different answers. Some say that the various musical instruments and spells used by Bard's came from the different planes in ways not unlike the ways wizardly and divine magic made their way to Faerun in the early days of its existence. Regardless, Bardcraft has shown itself to be a way to access the vast arcane powers of The Weave through the power of song in a way that is distinctly different from arcane and diving schools of thought. In time, bardcraft eventually organized itself into the schools and colleges that are known throughout Faerun today. At least, on the surface of Faerun.",
						"While it does not exactly mirror the world above it, Faerun's Underdark has its own peoples, cities and cultures that have their own take on arcane, divine, and yes, bardic magic based on the properties of the Underdark and the deities that its denizens worship. This includes the most notorious of Underdark residents, the drow, and the exceedingly rare form of bardcraft embedded in their own culture, that of the ancient drow sect, the Bae'qeshel Telphraezzar, The Whisperers Of The Dark Queen."

After the Fourth Crown War and the Ilythiiri were banished to the Underdark, forever being known as the dhaerow (traitors), only a small group of these dark minstrels remained as drow culture began to become more centered around the divine communion with Lolth that it is known for today."
