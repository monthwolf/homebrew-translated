				"You touch a single object and create a mystical connection with it. After you cast this spell, if the object is damaged, destroyed, moved, or touched at any later time, you instantly are aware of this fact. If another creature touches this object, you receive a mental image of the creature and the area within 60 feet of the object. This mental image sees through darkness, including magical darkness, and can see through illusions or other false effects. This image also counts as firsthand knowledge if you cast scrying on the creature that disturbed the object.",
				"You receive the mental alert if the item is disturbed for any reason, including if it is handled or touched with a long metal pole, a cat walks on it, or an earthquake knocks it over. You can also designate a verbal password that allows a creature to handle the object without sounding the mental alert. After being activated, the spell immediately ends on the object. Because of its costly material components, many wizards and sorcerers use this spell to safeguard valuable, rare items.",
				"A {@i watchware} spell counts as a magical trap for the purposes of spells, features, and effects."
