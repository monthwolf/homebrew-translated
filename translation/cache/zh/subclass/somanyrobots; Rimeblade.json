	"Rimeblades are an obscure breed of rogue, adventurers who are imbued with the icy touch of winter.

Good-aligned Rimeblades may be investigators or treasure hunters, while evil Rimeblades make excellent assassins.": "冰刃剑士可能拥有任何取向或背景，尽管他们的历史中会有与冬季力量相关的事物。然而，一旦他们踏上冰刃之路，他们可能会倾向于邪恶，或者至少是自私的 - 毕竟，那些一触即化的匕首和小刀是避免留下证据的简单方法。善良取向的冰刃剑士可能是调查员或寻宝者，而邪恶的冰刃剑士则是出色的刺客。",
