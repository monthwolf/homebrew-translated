	"Druids of the Circle of Upheaval embody the element of earth, not as a steadfast protector, but as a destructive agent of change. Their abilities are similarly turbulent, capable of upending even the sturdiest of foundations.": "乱世循环德鲁伊体现了地球元素，不是作为坚定的保护者，而是作为破坏性的变革者。他们的能力同样动荡，能够颠覆甚至最坚固的基础。 (Druids of the Circle of Upheaval)"
