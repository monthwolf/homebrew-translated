	"Bards of the College of Legends study the great epics of the past and the legendary figures whose mighty deeds were immortalized within them. To these bards, however, the true legends are their predecessors who composed such works while living out the adventures side by side with the heroes. Members of this college look to claim their place in history by penning their own magnificent story. To this end, they seek out worthy companions to join on adventures. If they find no one they deem suitable for the part of main hero, these bards are more than willing and capable of filling that role themselves.": "传说学院的吟游诗人研究过去的伟大史诗和那些被永远记载在其中的传奇人物。然而，对于这些吟游诗人来说，真正的传奇是那些在与英雄并肩冒险的同时创作这些作品的前辈。这个学院的成员希望通过创作自己的壮丽故事来留名史册。为此，他们寻找值得信赖的同伴一起冒险。如果他们找不到适合扮演主角的人，这些吟游诗人也愿意并且有能力自己扮演这个角色。",

	"After a creature uses or loses a Bardic Inspiration die from you, that creature gains one Enduring Inspiration die, a {@dice d4}. This die has the same uses and restrictions as your Bardic Inspiration die. A creature can have one of each, but cannot use both to modify the same roll.": "在生物使用或失去你的吟游诗人灵感骰后，该生物获得一个持久灵感骰，一个{@dice d4}。这个骰子的使用次数和限制与你的吟游诗人灵感骰相同。一个生物可以拥有一个持久灵感骰和一个吟游诗人灵感骰，但不能同时使用两者来修改同一次掷骰。",
	"At 3rd level, you begin crafting your own masterpiece for the ages, adding to it over time as you live out your adventures. Choose one creature or yourself to be the focus of your story.

	"As an action, you can choose one creature that is within 60 feet of you that can hear you and is not the focus of your story. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die. If you choose yourself, you gain one Enduring Inspiration die instead.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.": "作为一个动作，你可以选择一个距离你不超过60英尺、能听到你声音的生物，且不是你故事的焦点。该生物获得一个吟游诗人灵感骰。如果你选择自己，你获得一个持久灵感骰。被选择的生物也会成为你故事的焦点，直到你的下一个回合结束时，你可以选择保持它作为故事的焦点，或将焦点返回到之前的生物身上。一旦你使用了这个特性，你必须完成一次长休才能再次使用。",
	"Also at 6th level, whenever you perform your {@classFeature Song of Rest (d6)|Bard||2||Song of Rest}, you may regale your listeners with an epic story. Choose one of the tales below.

	"When a creature uses a Bardic or Enduring Inspiration die from you to modify a death saving throw it makes and succeeds, it counts as two successes. If the result of the modified roll was 20 or greater, you can treat the {@dice d20} roll as a 20. Once a creature is considered to have rolled a 20 in this way, it can't gain that benefit from this feature again until after a long rest.": "当一只生物使用你的吟游诗人或持久灵感骰来修改它进行的成功的死亡豁免投掷时，它算作两次成功。如果修改后的投掷结果为20或更高，你可以将{@dice d20}的投掷视为20。一旦一只生物以这种方式被认为投掷了20，它在经过一次长休息之前不能再从这个特性中获得这个好处。",
