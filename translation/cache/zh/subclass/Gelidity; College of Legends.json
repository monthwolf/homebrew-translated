	"Bards of the College of Legends study the great epics of the past and the legendary figures whose mighty deeds were immortalized within them. To these bards, however, the true legends are their predecessors who composed such works while living out the adventures side by side with the heroes. Members of this college look to claim their place in history by penning their own magnificent story. To this end, they seek out worthy companions to join on adventures. If they find no one they deem suitable for the part of main hero, these bards are more than willing and capable of filling that role themselves.": "",
	"When you join the College of Legends at 3rd level, your ability to dramatically embellish the efforts of others fills them with a powerful inspiration that lasts longer than before.": ""
