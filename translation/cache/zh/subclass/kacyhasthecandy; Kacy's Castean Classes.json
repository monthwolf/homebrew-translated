	"Among the more superstitious, inland-dwelling folk of Castea, the oceans and seas are things to be feared. According to myth and legend, the seas swallowed up ancient civilizations during the Great Storm, bringing about untold amounts of death and destruction. These people view the gods and clerics of the Depths domain in much the same way: as bringers of ill-fates. However, those who have a closer connection to the seas, such as those who reside on the coasts or islands, recognize that a swift death is only guaranteed if you fail to offer the proper respect. They know that if one offers deference and respect, the waters of the deep will return the gesture. Clerics of the Depths domain embody this dichotomy. They are people to be feared and respected, deliverers of both punishment and bounty. They are people of little patience and infinite wrath, and at the same time, deeply caring and giving souls.": "在Castea更迷信的内陆居民中，海洋是让人恐惧的东西。根据神话和传说，海洋在大风暴期间吞噬了古代文明，带来了难以计数的死亡和破坏。这些人以同样的方式看待深渊领域的神灵和牧师：作为厄运的带来者。然而，那些与海洋有更密切联系的人，比如那些居住在海岸或岛屿上的人，认识到只有在你没有给予适当的尊重时，才能保证迅速的死亡。他们知道，如果一个人给予尊重和敬意，深海的水会回报他的姿态。深海领域的神职人员体现了这种二元对立。他们是值得敬畏和尊重的人，是惩罚和赏赐的传递者。他们是缺乏耐心和无限愤怒的人，同时也是深具爱心和奉献精神的人。",
	"On Castea, clerics of the Depths domain typically worship (TBD), the Ancestor goddess of ill omens and the seas, or another lesser deity of the ocean. These gods of the depths expect of their clerics two things: to warn the masses of the dangers of the sea, and to demonstrate what happens when you disrespect their power. They loathe above all else arrogance and ignorance, and command their clerics to punish such behaviour with the wrath of the waves. Additionally, clerics of this domain will act as stewards and guides for those who wish to go to sea. They will make offerings or sacrifices to their deity to ensure a seafaring crew's safe return, bless ships and other vessels, or even accompany sailing crews to provide safe passage on treacherous journeys.": "在卡斯塔，深渊领域的神职人员通常崇拜（待定），不祥之兆和海洋的祖先女神，或另一个较小的海洋神灵。这些深海之神对他们的神职人员有两点期望：提醒大众注意海洋的危险，并展示不尊重他们力量的后果。他们最厌恶的是傲慢和无知，并命令他们的神职人员用海浪的愤怒来惩罚这种行为。此外，这个领域的神职人员将为那些想要出海的人充当管家和向导。他们会向自己的神灵献上祭品或牺牲，以确保航海人员的安全返回，为船舶和其他船只提供祝福，甚至陪同航海人员在危险的旅途中提供安全通道。",
