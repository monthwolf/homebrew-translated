	"Every Paladin answers a call, but while some are driven by their oath to a particular god or pantheon, the Brotherhood are initiated into the secrets and mysteries of the source of Knowledge and Magic. These arcane protectors ensure that magic is used safely and prudently; some of them seek out and correct those who are reckless with their power. Some are dedicated guardians at universities and mages' guilds, others are loyal bodyguards of travelling wizards. Some are seekers of ancient magical relics. Whatever their calling, all know the power of arcane magic and that such power is dangerous.": "每个圣骑士都会响应召唤，但有些人受誓约驱使，效忠于特定的神祇或诸神，而《(%Brotherhood%)兄弟会》的成员则被引入知识和魔法源头的秘密和奥秘。这些奥术护卫确保魔法被安全和谨慎地使用；其中一些人寻找并纠正那些滥用力量的人。有些人是大学和法师行会的忠诚守护者，另一些人是旅行法师的忠实护卫。还有一些人是追寻古代魔法遗物的探寻者。无论他们的使命是什么，他们都知道奥术魔法的力量以及这种力量的危险性。"
