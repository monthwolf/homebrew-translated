	"For those with the willpower and time, arcane magic can be a path to great power. Those who ascend to these lofty heights of arcane power are known as Archmages, masters of the weave. So wondrous is their power, and so strange are their goals, these masters of magic will sometimes enlist warlocks to help with, what appear to the Archmage, to be trivial tasks.": "对于那些有毅力和时间的人来说，奥术魔法可以是通往强大力量的途径。那些登上奥术力量高峰的人被称为大法师，纺织大师。他们的力量如此神奇，他们的目标如此奇特，这些魔法大师有时会招募术士来帮助完成在大法师看来微不足道的任务。",

	"Beginning at 6th level, you can draw on the arcane power of your patron to shield yourself from harm. When a creature you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to instantly teleport through the Astral Plane, causing the attack to miss. You immediately reappear in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet.": "从6级开始，你可以借助你的守护者的奥术力量保护自己免受伤害。当你能看见的生物用攻击命中你时，你可以使用你的反应立即穿越星界平面传送，使攻击未命中。你会立即重新出现在你能看见的30英尺内的一个未被占据的空间中。",

	"At 14th level, you have grown powerful enough to form a Coven of your own. At the end of a long rest, you can choose two willing creatures with the spellcasting or Pact Magic ability to form a Coven with you. While the members of your Coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can all cast any Spell Known or prepared by another member of the Coven, along with their own spells, expending their own spell slots.": "在14级时，你已经变得足够强大，可以组建自己的魔法同盟。在完成一次长休后，你可以选择两个愿意的生物，他们必须具有施法或契约魔法能力，与你一起组成魔法同盟。当同盟成员彼此之间距离在30英尺以内时，他们可以共同施放同盟中其他成员所掌握或准备的任何法术，同时消耗自己的法术位。",
