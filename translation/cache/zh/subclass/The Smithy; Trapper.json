	"A trapper is a specialist, often hailing from the outlands or wilderness. They prefer to do as little fighting as possible, instead using traps, tricks, and canniness to leave their foes as restricted as they see fit before they begin attacking. Battlefields that have been fought upon by trappers are left teeming with tied ropes, bear traps, and iron spikes.": "一个陷阱师是一位专家，通常来自偏远地区或荒野。他们更喜欢尽可能少地进行战斗，而是利用陷阱、诡计和机智，让他们的敌人在开始攻击之前受到尽可能多的限制。被陷阱师作战过的战场上到处都是绑着绳子、捕熊陷阱和铁钉。",
	"The philosophy of a trapper is simple: let it move, watch it fall, and rend it brutally once it is on the ground.": "捕兽者的哲学很简单：让它移动，看着它倒下，一旦它落地就残忍地击溃它。",
	"Starting at 3rd level, when you use {@item caltrops (bag of 20)|phb|caltrops}, {@item ball bearings (bag of 1,000)|phb|ball bearings}, or {@item hunting trap|phb|hunting traps}, you add your proficiency bonus to the item's saving throw DC. Some of your features refer to traps; caltrops, ball bearings, and hunting traps are considered traps for you. Traps you set gain several benefits:": "从3级开始，当你使用{@item caltrops (bag of 20)|phb|caltrops}、{@item ball bearings (bag of 1,000)|phb|ball bearings}或{@item hunting trap|phb|hunting traps}时，你可以将你的熟练加值加到物品的豁免扑克牌 DC 上。你的一些特性涉及陷阱；铁蒺藜、滚珠和捕猎陷阱对你来说被视为陷阱。你设置的陷阱获得一些好处：",

All the other rules for the Sneak Attack feature still apply to you.": "如果目标的移动受到陷阱限制，你在攻击投掷中不需要获得优势来使用你的{@classFeature Sneak Attack|Rogue||1}。对于潜行攻击特性的其他规则仍然适用于你。",
	"A creature attempting to spot a trap you've set must succeed on a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check against the trap's saving throw DC.": "一个试图发现你设置的陷阱的生物必须通过一个感知 ({@skill Perception}) 检定，检定值要达到陷阱的豁免 DC。",

	"At 3rd level, you can set a unique trap called a tripwire. When you set a tripwire, you use your action to choose two points that you passed through with your movement on the current turn, and set a tripwire that stretches between them by using a wire, rope or chain of equal length. The tripwire does not pass through solid objects. The wire snares creatures as they cross over it: a hostile creature that leaves a space covered by the tripwire must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier. On a failed save, the creature falls {@condition prone} upon leaving the space.": "在3级时，你可以设置一个名为绊线(tripwire)的独特陷阱。当你设置绊线时，你可以使用一个动作选择你在当前回合移动时经过的两个点，并使用等长的金属丝、绳索或链条设置一条连接它们的绊线。绊线不能穿过实体物体。当生物穿过绊线时，绊线会将它们缠住：一个敌对生物如果离开绊线覆盖的区域，必须通过一个敏捷豁免 DC 为8 + 你的熟练加值 + 你的敏捷调整值的检定。未通过检定的生物在离开区域时会摔倒{@condition prone}。",

When you do this, the first creature that fails its saving throw against the trap takes fire damage equal to your {@classFeature Sneak Attack|Rogue||1}.": "当你使用动作设置陷阱时，你可以给它加上爆炸物。当你这样做时，第一个未能通过陷阱豁免检定的生物会受到等于你{@classFeature Sneak Attack|Rogue||1}的火焰伤害。",
	"Explosives are highly volatile, and you can't have more than one trap laced with explosive at a time. You can remove explosive from a laced trap within 5 feet of you as part of your movement (no action required).": "爆炸物极易挥发，你一次只能设置一个陷阱，其中含有爆炸物。你可以在移动时（不需要动作）将陷阱中的爆炸物移除，距离必须在你的5英尺范围内。",
	"Once you reach 13th level, the explosion also {@condition blinded|phb|blinds} the target and reduces its movement to 0 until the end of its turn.": "一旦你达到13级，爆炸也会对目标造成伤害，并使其移动速度降为0，直到其回合结束。",
	"You can turn battlefields into oppressive warzones for your foes. On the first round of combat, before any other creature has yet acted, you can immediately use your reaction move up to your speed and set up to two traps of your choice. You can set each trap at any point in your movement. Once you reach 13th level, you can set a third trap as part of the reaction.": "你可以将战场变成令敌人感到压迫的战区。在战斗的第一轮中，在任何其他生物还没有行动之前，你可以立即使用你的反应移动你的速度，并设置两个你选择的陷阱。你可以在移动的任何点设置每个陷阱。一旦你达到13级，你可以作为反应设置第三个陷阱。",

	"Additionally, when you're {@condition prone}, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.": "此外，当你处于{@condition prone}状态时，你可以通过消耗5英尺的移动来站起来，而不是消耗一半的速度。",

At the end of the 1 minute, the trap triggers.": "如果你重新设置陷阱，你可以设置一个短导火线。当你这样做时，在接下来的1分钟内的任何时候，你可以使用你的动作来触发陷阱，只要它在你的5英尺内。在1分钟结束时，陷阱会被触发。",
	"Once you reach 17th level, your traps become uniquely mechanised with dangerous sprung restraints. These might take the form of foot-tangling ball bearings that burst and glue the foe to the ground, caltrops with thorny, extending spikes, or tripwires that lash out and constrict around foes.": "一旦你达到17级，你的陷阱将变得独特机械化，带有危险的弹簧限制装置。这些可能采取缠绕在敌人脚下、将其粘在地面上的球形滚珠，带有多刺伸展尖刺的铁蒺藜，或者能够抽打并缠绕住敌人的绊线。",
	"As a reaction when you see a creature within 60 feet of you end its turn within 5 feet of a trap, you can use this feature to force the target to make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier. On a failed save, the trap is destroyed, and the target becomes {@condition restrained}. A creature restrained in this way can use its action to make a Strength check against the same DC, ending the effect on a success.": "当你看到一个生物在你的60英尺内，在陷阱的5英尺范围内结束其回合时，你可以使用这个特性，强迫目标进行一次力量豁免检定，难度等于8 + 你的熟练加值 + 你的敏捷调整值。如果豁免失败，陷阱被摧毁，目标变为{@condition restrained}。被这种方式束缚的生物可以使用其动作进行一次力量检定，难度与之前相同，成功则效果结束。",
	"Once a creature fails its saving throw against this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.": "一旦生物未能通过此特性的豁免检定，你就不能再次使用它，直到你完成短休或长休。"
