In order to compensate for their shortcomings, they must learn to cast aside all fear and turn the tables on anyone or anything that would consider them easy prey.": "",
	"Only small characters can follow the Path of the Honey Badger. Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign or your character. Perhaps you've had a significant growth spurt since your upbringing, or maybe you were raised among the exceptionally large.": "",
	"When you choose this path at 3rd level, the benefits of your brutal upbrining begin to show. You've learned how to best use your size and speed to your advantage. You can move through the spaces of hostile creatures of any size.": "",
	"While you're raging, you can deal an extra {@dice 1d4} damage when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack if you were in the same space as it at any point during your turn. You can't deal this extra damage to the same creature more than once per round. The damage of this feature increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to {@dice 1d6} at 6th level, {@dice 1d8} at 10th level, and {@dice 1d10} at 14th level.": ""
