	"Also at 1st level, you learn the {@spell Mage Armor} spell, which doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. In addition, you can cast it on yourself by spending 1 or more sorcery points instead of expending a spell slot. When you cast it this way, you gain a number of temporary hitpoints equal to the number of sorcery points you spent plus your Sorcerer level. Once you've cast this spell this way, you can't do so by spending sorcery points again until you finish a short or long rest.": ""
