	"Legends tell that a Spirit Caller is born when the soul of a yokai and humanoid meet in the misty void that holds minds waiting to be given life. Spirit Callers are able to manifest their willpower and vitality as a spectral being, a wraith-like spirit that emerges from their body to strike at their enemies. The bond between Caller and spirit is visceral; in response to its Caller's fury, a spirit might detonate a blast of necrotic energy, magnify its size, or hone its senses. A Spirit Caller is the epitome of self-reliance and personal strength, their soul and willpower manifested as a being of its own.": ""
