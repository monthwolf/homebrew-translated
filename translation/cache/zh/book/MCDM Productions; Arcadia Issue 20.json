	"We've published several subclasses for spellcasters in ARCADIA, but none for barbarians, fighters, rangers, or rogues—and James and my D&D groups were super into the idea of a shield-wielding fighter.

I also wanted something that would suit the shield-maiden archetype, which mixes history and myth into a top-notch fantasy aesthetic.": "我们在阿卡迪亚（ARCADIA）为法师发布了几个子职业，但没有为野蛮人、战士、游侠或盗贼发布过——James和我的D&D小组对持盾战士的概念非常感兴趣。大多数人会想到美国队长，但我自己的灵感实际上来自{@link Hades|https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/}，在那里我花了许多时间挥舞着混沌之盾——埃癸斯（Aegis），在地狱之下与敌人搏斗。我还想要一些适合盾女战士原型的东西，将历史和神话融入顶级幻想美学中。",
	"Armed with these concepts, I started scribbling down ideas for cool things to do with shields, as well as ideas for magic shields and new equipment. These early notes were like having a conversation with myself—there were a lot of question marks for things I wasn't sure about or hadn't solved yet. Early on, I thought the Shieldbearer might have a list of maneuvers, like the Battle Master, or that I'd design light, medium, and heavy shields, with different techniques available for each, but neither of those worked in practice. Designing character options is a lot like assembling a puzzle, except you're drawing the image and cutting out the pieces at the same time!": "武装着这些概念，我开始草拟使用盾牌的酷炫点子，以及魔法盾牌和新装备的想法。这些早期笔记就像是在和自己对话一样——对于我不确定或尚未解决的事情，有很多问号。一开始，我认为护盾使者可能会有一系列操作，就像战斗大师一样，或者我会设计轻型、中型和重型盾牌，每种盾牌都有不同的技巧可用，但在实践中这两者都不起作用。设计角色选项很像是拼图，只不过你在同时绘制图像和剪裁拼图！",
	"When I wanted to procrastinate on writing, I researched the history of shields, so I could represent more variety than the medieval European {@link heater shield|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heater_shield} and more specificity than the generic shield in the core rules. I also looked for cool real-world battle maneuvers involving shields, like a more realistic version of {@link this scene|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDte-axR9l8} where a bunch of guys with huge shields become a human cannonball. I didn't find any such battle maneuvers, but I did gather some inspiration for a few of the magic shields!": "当我想拖延写作时，我研究了盾牌的历史，这样我就可以展现比中世纪欧洲{@link heater shield|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heater_shield}更多的多样性，也比核心规则中的通用盾牌更具体。我还寻找了涉及盾牌的酷炫真实战斗动作，比如一个更真实的版本{@link this scene|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDte-axR9l8}，其中一群拿着巨大盾牌的人变成了人类炮弹。我没有找到类似的战斗动作，但我确实为一些魔法盾牌收集了一些灵感！",
	"Ultimately, the Shieldbearer subclass completely ignores two unfortunate real-world facts: shields don't actually make good weapons, and throwing a heavy, not particularly aerodynamic object is unlikely to be effective no matter how strong you are. A tricky game design challenge is balancing consistency in a game world where the laws of physics are (by default) similar to our own with the need to set realism aside for the sake of epic fantasy. In the original draft, a Shieldbearer could only throw their shield a number of feet equal to 5 × their Strength modifier, but James and the testers talked me out of that limitation. Now the Shield Toss {@sup {@cite Shield Yeet|Ar20|1}} feature gives you a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 60 feet. More fun, less arithmetic.": "最终，护盾使者（Shieldbearer）子职完全忽略了两个不幸的现实：盾牌实际上并不是好的武器，而且投掷一个沉重、不太流线型的物体，无论你有多强壮，都不太可能有效。一个棘手的游戏设计挑战是在一个物理法则（默认情况下）与我们自己相似的游戏世界中保持一致性，同时为了史诗幻想的缘故而放弃现实主义。在原始草案中，护盾使者只能将他们的盾牌投掷的距离等于他们的力量调整值乘以5英尺，但詹姆斯和测试人员说服我放弃了那个限制。现在，盾牌投掷（Shield Toss）{@sup {@cite Shield Yeet|Ar20|1}技能让你的普通射程为30英尺，远程射程为60英尺。更有趣，少些算术。",
	"Speaking of the testers, extensive and effective playtesting is at the heart of what we do here at MCDM. Everything we release goes through at least two full rounds of playtesting, where our amazing testers give the material an in-depth read, run games with it, and enter specific notes in a well-organized spreadsheet. As a managing editor, this is a dream, and as an author, I love getting feedback from the testers to catch issues, confirm or refute concerns, and help me deliver on my vision. For example, the first version of the Shieldbearer gave two features at level 3 that {@i seemed} substantial, but neither one was very impactful—something I wouldn't have realized without testing. Designing a good subclass is tricky, as no one typically has time to play it from level 1 to 20, but the testers' input helped deliver the right features in the right order so it's balanced and fun to play at any level. Having two rounds of playtesting is invaluable—it keeps us from over-correcting and gives us the chance to actually test out more than one approach.": "说到测试人员，广泛而有效的游戏测试是MCDM在这里所做的核心工作。我们发布的所有内容都经过至少两轮完整的游戏测试，我们出色的测试人员会对材料进行深入阅读，运行游戏，并在一个组织良好的电子表格中输入具体的注释。作为一名编辑主管，这是一个梦想，作为一名作者，我喜欢从测试人员那里获得反馈，以发现问题，确认或反驳顾虑，并帮助我实现我的愿景。例如，Shieldbearer的第一个版本在3级提供了两个特性，{@i seemed}都很重要，但都不太有影响力——这是我没有经过测试就意识不到的问题。设计一个好的子职业很棘手，因为通常没有人有时间从1级玩到20级，但测试人员的意见帮助我们按正确顺序提供正确特性，使其在任何级别都平衡且有趣。进行两轮游戏测试是非常宝贵的——它让我们避免过度纠正，并让我们有机会实际测试不止一种方法。",
