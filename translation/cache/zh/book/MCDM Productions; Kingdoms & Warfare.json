	"I have always viewed the worlds of fantasy RPGs in terms of domains. The idea that the world is divided into spheres of influence and power, with specific people in charge of those things. Even as a teenager, I played in lots of different fantasy worlds, and I judged them all based on one thing: the map. I used maps as the keys that unlocked the different domains in a world.": "我一直把奇幻RPG的世界看作是领域。这个想法是世界被划分为不同的影响力和权力领域，由特定的人负责管理。即使在青少年时期，我也在许多不同的奇幻世界中游玩，我根据一个标准来评判它们：地图。我把地图当作打开世界不同领域的钥匙。",
	"Maps are one of the GM's most powerful tools. The map of the local area, the map of the region, the map of the city, the map of the world. Because maps invite exploration. A map explicitly asks the players to pore over it, point to something evocative or mysterious, and ask: \"What's this?\"": "地图是GM最强大的工具之一。本地区的地图，区域的地图，城市的地图，世界的地图。因为地图邀请探索。地图明确要求玩家仔细查看，指向引人入胜或神秘的地方，并问：“这是什么？”",
	"In the '80s and early '90s, there was an explosion of new, official campaign settings. New fantasy worlds for RPGs. And my friends and I were excited to try them. But whenever I saw the mapIn the '80s and early '90s, there was an explosion of new, official campaign settings. New fantasy worlds for RPGs. And my friends and I were excited to try them. But whenever I saw the map of a new world, I always wondered the same thing: \"Who's in charge here?\" I don't know why that was important to me. Probably, I was just looking for some kind of organizing principle. Some kind of lens to view all this new information through.": "在80年代和90年代初，出现了大量新的官方战役设置。这些是为RPGs设计的新奇幻世界。我和朋友们都很兴奋地想要尝试它们。但每当我看到一个新世界的地图时，我总是会想同样的问题：“这里谁在掌控？”我不知道为什么这对我来说很重要。可能我只是在寻找某种组织原则。一种透视所有这些新信息的镜头。",
	"I didn't literally think, \"Whose domain is this?\" I wouldn't have used that language. And I never thought exclusively about barons and dukes and queens. If I pointed to a great forest, I wouldn't expect it to belong to a feudal noble. I know how fantasy works: it's a big forest, so it probably belongs to the elves!": "我并没有字面上想，“这是谁的领地？”我不会用那种措辞。我从来没有只想到过男爵、公爵和皇后。如果我指着一片巨大的森林，我不会期待它属于封建贵族。我知道奇幻作品是怎么运作的：这是一片大森林，所以很可能属于精灵！",
	"But which elves? Surely a forest this big is an important asset, and some elven court considers it their realm. Their domain. And if not, that's probably because it's contested! A hot or cold war over ancient elven boundaries! Drama!": "但是哪些精灵？毫无疑问，这么大的森林是一项重要资产，某个精灵法庭认为这是他们的领地。他们的领域。如果不是这样，那可能是因为这里存在争议！围绕古老精灵边界的热战或冷战！戏剧性！",
	"Or maybe the forest belongs to an order of powerful druids. Maybe they keep it deliberately wild and pool their resources to ensure no single civilization takes it over! Well, those druids would be just another domain.": "或许这片森林属于一群强大德鲁伊的秩序。也许他们故意保持它的荒野状态，并集中资源确保没有任何一个文明占领它！嗯，这些德鲁伊就成为了另一个领域。",
	"That's how my mind worked then, and how it still works. It's okay if some places aren't controlled by anyone. But then, as now, when I see a map of a fantasy world and there are no political boundaries, no answers, no information to tell me, \"Who's in charge?\" anywhere, I get disappointed. I feel like...there's a layer of information missing.": "那是我当时的思维方式，也是我现在的思维方式。如果有些地方没有任何人控制，那也没关系。但是，当我看到一个幻想世界的地图上没有政治边界，没有答案，没有信息告诉我在任何地方“谁在掌控”，无论是当时还是现在，我都会感到失望。我觉得...缺少了一层信息。",
	"To date, there's never been an edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game whose core rules took the idea of different domains—whether those are counts and dukes and queens, or druid enclaves, wizard circles, or knightly orders—and gave them mechanical features. Not just, \"Oh, you get this one feature if you join this organization,\" but rules for letting different organizations engage in planning, conspiracy, and conflict the way people do.": "迄今为止，世界上最受欢迎的角色扮演游戏从未有过一个版本的核心规则考虑到不同领域的概念——无论是伯爵、公爵和皇后，还是德鲁伊聚落、巫师圈子或骑士团——并赋予它们机械特性。不仅仅是“哦，如果你加入这个组织，你会得到这个特性”，而是让不同组织像人类一样参与规划、密谋和冲突的规则。",
	"That's what this book tries to do. I wanted to give you the tools to add organizations and warfare to your games and make doing so fun. When players think about their own party of heroes, even without changing anything about their characters, I hope they'll recognize at least one of the organizations or specializations in here as fitting their group.2 When GMs see all the different NPC realms in the book, I hope they'll want to run new adventures with a hag coven as the villain, building a secret army in the swamp. Or an evil empire run by an immortal dragon. A draconic tyranny!": "这本书的目的就在于此。我希望为你提供工具，让你能够在游戏中添加组织和战争元素，并且让这一过程变得有趣。即使玩家们没有改变角色，当他们考虑到自己的英雄队伍时，我希望他们能够至少认出这里的某个组织或专业领域与他们的团队相匹配。当GM看到书中所有不同的NPC领域时，我希望他们会想要以一个女巫团为反派，在沼泽中建立秘密军队，展开新的冒险。或者是由不死龙掌控的邪恶帝国。龙族暴政！",
	"When players choose an organization and a specialization, their characters gain new mechanical features—but they'll also feel more like a formal group. They'll have to communicate more to use their new domain powers, and will argue about how best to use domain features during a new phase of the game, called intrigue. Everyone will communicate, argue, and compromise—just like the members of a real organization.": "当玩家选择一个组织和一个专长时，他们的角色会获得新的机械特性，但他们也会更像一个正式的团队。他们将不得不更多地沟通以使用他们的新领域能力，并且在游戏的一个新阶段（称为阴谋）中争论如何最好地使用领域特性。每个人都会沟通、争论和妥协——就像一个真正组织的成员一样。",
	"This book will give the heroes and villains in your games more influence, more impact. Their reach will extend beyond the end of their swords or the range of their spells. The party's agents can go out and spy, research, build, and negotiate, all while the heroes are dungeon delving. And of course, when those heroes discover that another domain is building an army to march against the people who look to them for leadership, they can build their own army and prepare for war!": "这本书将赋予你游戏中的英雄和反派更多的影响力、更大的影响力。他们的影响将超越他们的剑或法术的射程。队伍的特工可以外出间谍、研究、建设和谈判，而英雄们则在地牢中探险。当这些英雄发现另一个领地正在组建军队准备对抗那些依赖他们领导的人民时，他们可以组建自己的军队，为战争做准备！",
	"This book might not be for everyone. But if any of the above sounds cool to you, we think you'll like it.": "这本书可能并不适合所有人。但如果以上任何内容听起来很酷，我们认为你会喜欢它。",

	"There's a lot in this book, but what's here ultimately boils down to two systems: intrigue and warfare.": "这本书内容很丰富，但最终归结为两个系统：阴谋和战争。",
	"{@b Intrigue} is conflict between two domains. A holy church versus a mystic circle. The Knights Templar against a dragon tyrant. A bunch of disorganized misfit adventurers against a nation of undead!": "{@b Intrigue} 是两个领域之间的冲突。 一座神圣的教堂对抗一个神秘的圈子。 圣殿骑士对抗一只龙暴君。 一群杂乱无章的冒险者对抗一个不死国家！",
	"A {@b domain} is a pretty simple thing as a game concept. It's got four skills. It uses actions and reactions and bonus actions, just like characters and monsters. It has three defenses, but no hit points. The only way to \"kill\" a domain is to neutralize its officers—although some might escape and start a new domain for the sequel campaign! A domain could be a kingdom, thieves' guild, or druid circle!": "一个{@b domain}是一个相当简单的游戏概念。它有四个技能。它使用行动、反应和奖励行动，就像角色和怪物一样。它有三种防御，但没有生命值。唯一的“杀死”一个领域的方法是中和它的官员——尽管有些可能会逃脱并为续集战役开启一个新的领域！一个领域可以是一个王国、盗贼行会或德鲁伊圈！",
	"An intrigue only ever takes place between two domains. That makes the system simple and easy to keep track of. Other domains might get involved, but purely as allies, lending aid. Of course, depending on the adventure, it's possible that a particular intrigue is just a prelude to another larger intrigue as the characters discover the villainous realm they just defeated was only a pawn in an even larger game....": "阴谋只会发生在两个领域之间。这使得系统简单且易于跟踪。其他领域可能会介入，但纯粹是作为盟友，提供帮助。当然，根据冒险的情节，可能某个特定的阴谋只是另一个更大阴谋的序曲，因为角色们发现他们刚刚击败的邪恶领域只是更大游戏中的一个棋子...",
	"Alongside the intrigue system, the book presents eight different heroic organizations (each of which can be customized with three specializations) and sixteen different NPC realms to use as allies, neutral observers, or enemies.": "除了阴谋系统外，这本书还介绍了八个不同的英雄组织（每个都可以通过三种专业化进行定制）和十六个不同的NPC领域，可以用作盟友、中立观察者或敌人。",
	"{@b Warfare} is conflict between units of soldiers and monsters. Along with rules for warfare, you'll find seventy-eight special units in this book and another sixty-four in the special unit deck available on our store (at {@i mcdmproductions.com/warfare-deck}).": "{@b Warfare}是单位士兵和怪物之间的冲突。除了战争规则，您将在本书中找到七十八个特殊单位，在我们商店的特殊单位牌组中还有另外六十四个（在{@i mcdmproductions.com/warfare-deck}）。",
	"So while it might look like an enormous amount of stuff in here at first glance, it's really just two systems, each relatively straightforward, and then a ton of options for those systems.": "所以乍一看，这里可能看起来有大量的内容，但实际上只是两个系统，每个系统都相对简单，然后有大量的选项供这些系统选择。",
	"The book also contains a handful of new items that can affect intrigue or warfare. And because they were popular in {@book Strongholds & Followers|SaF}, you get some new legendary artifacts called the codices. (Warning! They will unravel the fabric of reality!)": "这本书还包含一些可以影响阴谋或战争的新物品。而且因为它们在{@book Strongholds & Followers|SaF}很受欢迎，你将获得一些新的传奇神器，名为《(codices)》。（警告！它们会解开现实的面纱！）",
	"Strongholds & Followers presented six courts of extraplanar creatures that the gods might send to aid characters in battle if their faith is strong enough. Those were so popular that we expanded them with three additional courts—devils, demons, and undead. New monsters! Some of these creatures use the action-oriented design philosophy mentioned in \"Running the Game #83,\" designed to make it easier for a GM to use a single monster to challenge an entire party.": "《要塞与追随者》呈现了六个外域生物法庭，如果角色的信仰足够坚定，神灵可能会派遣它们来帮助战斗。它们非常受欢迎，我们还用三个额外的法庭——恶魔、恶魔和不死生物来扩展它们。新的怪物！其中一些生物采用了“游戏主持#83”中提到的行动导向设计理念，旨在让主持人更容易使用单个怪物来挑战整个队伍。",
	"Finally, there's an adventure designed to help you use and understand these rules. It's basically a big, detailed example of how the intrigue and warfare systems can work.": "最后，有一个冒险设计旨在帮助你运用和理解这些规则。它基本上是一个大而详细的示例，展示了阴谋和战争系统如何运作。",
	"First, you should check out the {@b Glossary of Terms} section, which covers all the new terms the book uses. Don't worry about reading the whole thing, but just skimming it to familiarize yourself with the concepts will help a lot. And you can always refer back to the glossary if you're looking for a quick definition.": "首先，你应该查看{@b Glossary of Terms}部分，其中涵盖了书中使用的所有新术语。不用担心阅读整个部分，只是粗略地浏览一下以熟悉这些概念会很有帮助。如果你需要快速定义，随时可以参考术语表。",
	"One of the design goals of this book was to make as few assumptions as possible about your game. You can start using these rules right now, with your existing characters in the middle of your current campaign—or even right in the middle of an adventure. In fact, we hope these rules take your group and your adventures and elevate them, granting everything a broader scope and a feeling of raising the stakes. In a world where the forces of powerful domains vie for control of ancient artifacts and forgotten lore, every adventuring party and their enemies can now be listed among those domains.": "这本书的设计目标之一是尽可能少地对你的游戏做出假设。你可以立即开始使用这些规则，在你当前的战役中的现有角色中——甚至就在一个冒险的中途。事实上，我们希望这些规则能够提升你的团队和冒险，赋予一切更广阔的视野和提升风险感。在一个强大领地力量争夺古代文物和被遗忘知识的世界里，每支冒险队伍和他们的敌人现在都可以被列为那些领地之一。",
	"The easiest way to adopt these rules is to imagine that the heroes in your game are already an organization, with the players picking the specific type of organization from the eight in this book. Then set up the villains of the adventure as a villainous realm, which the GM picks from among the sixteen in the book.": "采纳这些规则的最简单方法是想象你游戏中的英雄已经是一个组织，玩家从本书中的八种特定类型的组织中选择。然后将冒险中的反派设置为一个邪恶领域，由主持人从本书的十六个领域中选择。",
	"You can stop there if you like. Domains have options that give their officers—both characters and NPCs—more things to do during an adventure or between adventures. But an organization is more than just its officers. There are followers, agents, and employees all ready to carry out the characters' and NPCs' orders. As such, leading a domain means players can have their organization conduct research or espionage while the characters continue exploring dungeons or fighting dragons.": "如果你愿意，你可以停在这里。领地有一些选项，可以让它们的军官——包括角色和NPC——在冒险中或冒险之间有更多事情可做。但一个组织不仅仅是它的军官。还有追随者、特工和雇员，他们都准备好执行角色和NPC的命令。因此，领地的领导意味着玩家可以让他们的组织在角色继续探索地牢或打斗龙的同时进行研究或间谍活动。",
	"Domains grant their officers access to domain features that become usable during intrigue. The GM will use the rules for intrigue to make the campaign more memorable as it moves toward one or more warfare battles that mark the intrigue's conclusion, with the heroes plotting and scheming against a villain as their organization uses its domain features and domain skills to prepare for battle—even as the villain does the same!": "领地授予其官员访问领地特性，在阴谋中可用。GM将使用阴谋规则，使战役更加难忘，直至阴谋的结局，其中将有一场或多场战争战斗，英雄们密谋策划对抗一个恶棍，他们的组织利用领地特性和领地技能为战斗做准备——而恶棍也在做同样的事情！",
	"Domains also grant their officers access to domain powers. These are new special features that allow characters to work together during any combat that takes place during intrigue against the officers of an opposed domain—just as the villain and their lieutenants will be working together on that opposing side. This includes the combat that runs alongside the potential climactic final battle at the end of intrigue. (Though not all adventures need to have a final battle, it's great fun!)": "领域还赋予它们的官员访问领域力量的权限。这些是新的特殊功能，允许角色在针对对立领域的官员进行的任何暗中活动中共同作战——就像反派及其副手将在对立方一边共同努力一样。这包括与潜在高潮战斗结束时的战斗同时进行的战斗。（尽管并非所有冒险都需要最终战斗，但这很有趣！）",
	"The warfare rules in this book are robust enough to be used as their own game. This can be a fun way to play out small skirmishes or major battles, and it works fine without using the rules for intrigue.": "这本书中的战争规则非常完善，足以作为独立的游戏。这可以是玩小规模冲突或重大战斗的有趣方式，即使不使用阴谋规则，也可以很好地运作。",
	"But finally—and most ambitiously—all these rules work together as a whole. The heroes become an organization as they plot and scheme against the villain's realm, making allies and raising an army. Time and again, they confront enemy leaders in combat using their new domain powers while their loyal forces clash around them! And though they might not be something that ends up a part of every session, battles between the armies of domains can lend an epic feel to any adventure. It's a little more work, certainly, but that work pays off in the kind of conflict that pushes players and GMs toward the biggest possible adventure finale.": "但最终——也是最雄心勃勃的——所有这些规则共同作用为一个整体。英雄们成为一个组织，他们密谋策划对抗邪恶势力的领地，结交盟友并筹备军队。一次又一次，他们利用新的领地力量与敌人领袖在战斗中对抗，而他们忠诚的部队则在周围激烈交战！虽然这可能不是每次冒险中都会发生的事情，但领地之间的军队之间的战斗可以为任何冒险增添史诗感。这当然需要更多的工作，但这种工作会在推动玩家和GM迈向可能的最大冒险结局的冲突中得到回报。",
	"There might be other things you wish this system did. If we've done a good job, it'll be easy for you to design your own optional rules that expand on this framework. We look forward to seeing what you do with the content that follows!": "也许您希望这个系统做其他事情。如果我们做得很好，那么您很容易设计自己的扩展这个框架的可选规则。我们期待看到您如何利用接下来的内容！",
	"To keep clear the differences between warfare and characters engaging in combat, this book uses \"combat\" to refer to characters and monsters skirmishing using the game's normal rules. \"Battle\" is used to refer to armies clashing using the warfare rules.": "为了清晰区分战争和角色参与战斗之间的差异，本书使用“战斗”一词来指代角色和怪物使用游戏的正常规则进行小规模战斗。而“战斗”一词则用来指代使用战争规则进行军队对抗的情况。",
	"Another thing this book makes no assumptions about is the scale of your game—specifically, the units of distance you use on your campaign map. How much territory a domain controls is something left to the GM—if it ever comes up at all. Domains can come into conflict all on their own as villains try to blow up the world or some small part of it, and the heroes trying to stop them likely don't need to know, \"Exactly how many square miles do they control?\"": "这本书没有做任何关于你的游戏规模的假设，特别是你在战役地图上使用的距离单位。领地控制的领土面积是留给GM决定的，如果有必要的话。领地可能会因为反派试图毁灭世界或其中的一小部分而自行发生冲突，而试图阻止他们的英雄们可能不需要知道，“他们控制了多少平方英里？”",
	"In addition to helping keep these rules flexible and easy to adopt, worrying about the literal area of a territory likely isn't something most people will find exciting in a game about pretending to be an elf who fights dragons. So in the end, the rules simply assume it takes about a week (however this is defined in your world) for a domain to carry out a single domain action. And even that can be easily tweaked to any length of time, as it's deliberately abstract. For a particular game, it might work to have a domain turn be a week at the beginning of an intrigue, but then only a single day at the end as the pace quickens and the stakes rise.": "除了帮助保持这些规则的灵活性和易于采纳外，担心领土的字面面积可能不是大多数人在假装成为一名与龙战斗的精灵的游戏中会感到兴奋的事情。因此，最终，规则简单地假设一个领域执行一项领域行动大约需要一周的时间（不过在你的世界中如何定义）。甚至这个时间长度也可以很容易地调整到任何长度，因为它是故意抽象的。对于特定的游戏，可能在阴谋开始时让一个领域回合是一周，但随着节奏加快和赌注升高，最后只有一天。",
	"\"We sell it back to them,\" Narco said. \"Hang on... then what are you gonna put on your bolts?\"": "“我们把它卖回给他们。”纳科说道。“等等…那你接下来要往你的弩箭上放什么？”",
	"Aurex nodded her head in agreement. \"Need I remind you,\" the half-devil assassin said, \"before your mind of chemicals and formulae overheats from its own cleverness, it took our people three weeks to steal those vials of {@i dreamtime}. And they managed to get in, get it, and get out without anyone noticing. Those resources could have been put to better use if that drug doesn't end up on a bolt in Castagan.\"": "奥瑞克斯点了点头表示同意。“我需要提醒你”，这位半恶魔刺客说，“在你那充满化学物质和公式的大脑因为自己的聪明而过热之前，我们的人民花了三周的时间才偷到那些瓶子里的{@i dreamtime}。他们设法进去、拿到了它，然后悄无声息地离开。如果那种毒品最终没有出现在卡斯塔根的弩箭上，这些资源本可以得到更好的利用。”",
	"Loroyan Thel, the drow brains of the Operation, peered at Narco from across the corner table of the quiet tavern. \"We can handle the paladin with or without magic poison, demidevil,\" he said, almost under his breath.": "洛洛扬·泰尔(Loroyan Thel)，这个行动的黑暗精灵智囊，从安静的酒馆角落的桌子那边盯着纳尔科(Narco)。\"我们可以用魔法毒药或者不用来对付那个圣骑士，半恶魔,\" 他几乎是低声说道。",
	"\"And get him to talk?\" Aurex said. \"Under {@i dreamtime}, he'll talk while he sleeps—and we'll know it's the truth.\"": "\"让他说话吗？\"奥瑞克斯说道。\"在{@i dreamtime}的作用下，他会在睡觉时说话——而我们会知道那是真相。\"",
	"Thel sighed. \"I'm aware of that.\"": "泰尔叹了口气。“我意识到了。”",
	"\"I thought the sleep juice was for your bolts,\" Zarek said. Not unusually, the half-orc enforcer felt two steps behind the conversation.": "\"我以为那瓶安眠药是给你的螺栓用的，\" 扎瑞克说道。不出所料，这位半兽人执法者感觉自己在对话中落后了两步。",
	"\"Forget the bolts, Zarek,\" Aurex said. \"I want to hear what our alchemist director of narcotics has in mind.\"": "“别管螺栓了，Zarek，”Aurex说道。“我想听听我们的麻醉剂研究主任打算做什么。”",
	"Narco turned to the half-devil. \"Aurex, don't you see?\" He smiled riotously, tossed a small vial into the air, then snatched it back again. \"It's exactly as you said. Our agents got into the Tower of the Lens, got the drug, got out with no alarms. No searching, no deaths, no guards alerted. No trace.\"": "纳尔科转向那个半恶魔。“奥瑞克斯，难道你没看到吗？”他狂笑着，将一个小瓶抛向空中，然后又抓了回来。“就像你说的一样。我们的特工成功进入了（Lens之塔）(Tower of the Lens)，拿到了毒品，毫无警报地离开了。没有搜查，没有死亡，没有警卫察觉。没有留下任何痕迹。”",
	"No one spoke.": "没有人说话。",
	"\"No trace... of us. So we take this back to the Lens, and we tell them we lifted it off someone who tried to sell it to us.\"": "“没有任何痕迹...关于我们。所以我们把这个带回到透镜（the Lens），然后告诉他们我们从一个试图向我们出售它的人那里拿到的。”",
	"\"Ah...\" Zarek said.": "\"啊...\" (Zarek) 说道。",
	"\"No good.\" Thel shook his head. \"They'll rumble that. Wizards are reliably clueless, but they're not stupid.\"": "“不行。” 赛尔摇了摇头。“他们会发觉的。巫师们通常一无所知，但并不愚蠢。”",
	"\"Hey, what if we kill someone?\" Zarek said. Everyone frowned at him, as this was his solution to everything. It would be on his family crest if fate ever conspired to make a noble of him.": "“嘿，要是我们杀了某人怎么办？”(Zarek)说道。大家都皱起了眉头，因为这对他来说似乎是解决问题的通用方法。如果命运真的让他成为贵族的话，这可能会成为他家族的家徽。",
	"Still, the half-orc had a point, so they let him continue. \"Okay, check this out, yeah? If it's just us, sure, they'll rumble that like Thel says. But if we give them a body? And we say, yeah this piece of piss tried to sell us this juice, but we didn't even know what it was! We asked him where he got it, he got defensive. Says he stole it from you wizards, right? And we said, 'Oh, you trying to offload your scrab on us so you can go back to the Lens and frame us? Pull the other one.' Then he got pissy and tried something, and we sorta had to kill him or whatever!\"": "然而，半兽人说得有道理，所以他们让他继续说道。“好吧，听着，对吧？如果只有我们，当然，他们会像塞尔说的那样揭露出来。但如果我们给他们一个尸体呢？然后我们说，是的，这个家伙试图卖给我们这个液体，但我们甚至不知道是什么！我们问他从哪里弄来的，他变得防御性强。说他从你们这些巫师那里偷来的，对吧？然后我们说，‘哦，你想把你的烂货卖给我们，这样你就可以回到透镜那里把我们陷害？别拿这种借口来忽悠我们了。’然后他变得愤怒，试图做点什么，我们只好杀了他或者类似的事情！”",

	"Thel slowly smiled and looked at Narco, who smiled back and waggled his eyebrows.": "Thel慢慢地微笑着看着纳科(Narco)，纳科(Narco)也微笑着挤了挤眉毛。",
	"Then they turned to look at Aurex, whose visage was inscrutable. Slowly, she spoke.": "然后他们转身看着奥瑞克斯(Aurex)，她的面容难以捉摸。慢慢地，她开口说道。",
	"\"It might work.\"": "\"这可能会起作用。\"",
	"\"Good enough for me,\" Thel said. \"Let's give it a shot. Well done, Zarek.\"": "\"对我来说已经足够了,\" 赛尔说道。\"让我们试试看。干得好，扎瑞克(Zarek)。\"",
	"\"Oh, thanks, boss,\" the enforcer said, beaming with pride.": "“哦，谢谢，老板，”执行者说道，满怀自豪地笑着。",
	"\"You people done scheming?\" A small, snarling voice piped up as Garrote, the Operation's chief negotiator and resident goblin officer, hopped up onto a chair.": "\"你们这些家伙搞定了吗？\" 一个小而咆哮的声音响起，作为行动首席谈判官兼驻地精官员的加罗特（Garrote）跳上一把椅子。",
	"Thel explained the plan.": "泰尔（Thel）解释了计划。",
	"The goblin was impressed. \"Hey, you came up with that all on your own?\" he asked Narco.": "哥布林印象深刻。“嘿，这都是你自己想出来的吗？”他问纳科((Narco))。",

	"\"Not bad for a drug addict.\"": "\"对一个药物成瘾者来说还不错。(drug addict)\"",

	"\"Oh yes, you're all very clever,\" Garrote said. \"But unless you've forgotten...\" He stabbed a dagger into the map of the temple the group intended to infiltrate, there to confront and combat the order of paladins who were, of late, bent on the destruction of the Operation. \"We still got this shit to deal with.\"": "\"哦，是的，你们都很聪明，\" 加罗特说道。\"但除非你们忘了...\" 他将匕首刺进了地图上那座小组打算渗透的神庙，那里面要面对和对抗那些最近一直试图摧毁行动的圣骑士团。\"我们还得处理这个破事。\"",
	"\"With all the intel Aurex ferreted out?\" Thel said. \"Their wizard's true name? The guards you blackmailed?\"": "“有了Aurex搜集到的所有情报？”Thel 说道。“他们的法师真名？你勒索的卫兵？”",
	"\"Thel, they have an army. They know we're coming for 'em. They're gonna surround this place so tight a mouse couldn't get in.\" Garrote pointed to Narco. \"And don't get any ideas. I'm not gonna be a mouse again, so put those filthy potions away.\"": "\"特尔，他们有一支军队。他们知道我们要来找他们了。他们会把这个地方团团围住，紧得连只老鼠都进不去。\" 加罗特指着纳科说道。\"别想多了。我可不会再做老鼠，所以把那些肮脏的药水收起来吧。\"",
	"\"Yeah, that is a pisser,\" Zarek said. \"We gonna fight our way in, boss?\"": "\"是的，这真是个糟糕的事情，\" (Zarek)说道。\"老板，我们要冲进去打吗？\"",

	"Garrote's face fell. Aurex and her blade. \"Yeah. Anyway. We take the {@i dreamtime} back to the Tower of the Lens, we give 'em some corpse they can pin all their suspicion on, just like Narco and Zarek say. Then we say 'Goodness, would you like this back? Seems expensive.' But then we say, 'We don't want paying.' Maybe Aurex's people dig up some dirt on the Lens? Should they even have this stuff? It's illegal as shit.

	"Narco nodded. \"Lend us a unit of elementals, show how grateful they are.\"": "纳科点了点头。“借给我们一个元素单位，展示它们有多感激。”",

	"The rules in this book give you a straightforward way to represent those domains with game mechanics, and to allow the player characters to step up onto a larger stage and translate their influence from adventuring into political power. Player-run domains are called {@b organizations}. NPC-run domains are called {@b realms}. This book presents eight different player organizations, each with three specialties, and another sixteen NPC realms.": "这本书中的规则为您提供了一种简单的方式来用游戏机制代表这些领域，并允许玩家角色走上更大的舞台，将他们在冒险中的影响力转化为政治权力。由玩家管理的领域称为{@b organizations}。由NPC管理的领域称为{@b realms}。这本书介绍了八个不同的玩家组织，每个组织有三种专长，以及另外十六个NPC领域。",
	"When two domains come into direct conflict, this is called an {@b intrigue}. The purpose of intrigue is to move toward a climactic confrontation involving combat between the officers of opposed domains and battles between their armies. Some adventures might end with just a final warfare battle at the end of intrigue, while others will feature numerous smaller battles leading up to a final battle alongside a final combat between the characters and the officers of an opposed domain. A domain can be destroyed only by neutralizing its officers. As such, once an intrigue starts, it continues until initiative is called for the final showdown between the domains' officers.": "当两个领域直接冲突时，这被称为{@b intrigue}。阴谋的目的是朝着一个高潮对抗中的冲突发展，包括对立领域的官员之间的战斗和他们军队之间的战斗。一些冒险可能以阴谋结束时的最终战争战斗而告终，而其他冒险则会在最终战斗之前进行许多较小的战斗，最终在对立领域的官员和角色之间的最终战斗中结束。一个领域只能通过使其官员无效化来摧毁。因此，一旦阴谋开始，直到为领域官员之间的最终对决宣布倡议为止，阴谋将继续。",
	"Running nations and guilds and churches and spy networks can be incredibly complex. It's easy to imagine a highly detailed game system that can model a world at this level. Tracking a barony's food supply, determining how much iron is available to a duchy, mapping out a spy network's elaborate web of agents, or even maintaining a list of a local religion's temples and shrines—it's all a complicated process. Games like that already exist, and are typically complex grand-strategy simulations that might even require a computer to run them.": "奔跑的国家和行会以及教堂和间谍网络可能非常复杂。很容易想象一个可以模拟这个层面世界的高度详细的游戏系统。跟踪一个男爵领地的食物供应，确定一个公国可用的铁数量，绘制出一个间谍网络复杂的特工网络，甚至维护一个当地宗教寺庙和神殿的清单——这都是一个复杂的过程。像这样的游戏已经存在，通常是复杂的大战略模拟游戏，甚至可能需要计算机来运行它们。",
	"This book takes a different approach.": "这本书采取了不同的方法。",
	"First off, these rules understand that you're already playing a complex fantasy RPG. We all know that just managing a single character or a world of NPCs can be a lot of work. So ideally, any domain management system has to be something that sits lightly on top of the game that players and GMs are already enjoying.": "首先，这些规则理解你已经在玩一个复杂的幻想RPG。我们都知道，管理一个角色或一群NPC可能会是一项繁重的工作。因此，理想情况下，任何领地管理系统都应该是轻松植入到玩家和GM已经享受的游戏之上的。",
	"Furthermore, the game almost always has a heavy focus on fighting monsters. Most monsters are defined by their combat prowess, and many of a character's best class features revolve around making them a better monster fighter. By assuming that training followers makes characters better at the stuff they're already good at—whether that means research, study, or fighting—running a domain provides another way to improve the effectiveness of player characters and NPCs in combat.": "此外，游戏几乎总是重点放在与怪物战斗上。大多数怪物都是以他们的战斗能力为定义，角色许多最佳职业特性都围绕着让他们成为更好的怪物战斗者。通过假设训练追随者使角色在他们已经擅长的事情上变得更加优秀——无论是研究、学习还是战斗——经营领地提供了另一种方式来提高玩家角色和NPC在战斗中的效力。",
	"Finally, almost every adventure involves some villain plotting and scheming while the heroes try to stop them. This system assumes that the villain runs their own villainous realm, that the player characters' organization is actively trying to stop them, and that this conflict will eventually come to a head in an all-out battle—or perhaps more than one. This is the same way things would pan out if you weren't using the new rules in this book. But with these rules, every officer in a domain has new special features called domain powers. These powers require communication and cooperation to use, even as armies clash in warfare to all sides.": "最终，几乎每次冒险都涉及到一些反派的阴谋和策划，而英雄们则试图阻止他们。这个系统假设反派经营着自己的邪恶领域，玩家角色的组织正在积极地试图阻止他们，而这种冲突最终将在一场全面战斗中达到高潮——或许不止一次。如果你没有使用这本书中的新规则，事情可能会发展成这样。但是有了这些规则，领域中的每位官员都拥有称为领域能力的新特殊功能。这些能力需要沟通和合作才能使用，即使在各方军队交战的战争中。",
	"In simplest terms, the rules in this book assume that characters continue adventuring as they normally do. While the characters are adventuring, slowly working their way toward a final confrontation with the villain, their domain is looking for allies to lend aid, investigating the villain and their lieutenants to learn their secrets, and disrupting the workings of the villain's realm to weaken that realm's forces in a final showdown. Even for a campaign that's in the middle of an adventure right now, players and GMs can adopt the new rules in this book to provide a framework for the campaign's existing plots and intrigue—then raise the stakes for both heroes and enemies in a warfare battle!": "简单来说，本书的规则假定角色会像往常一样继续冒险。当角色们在冒险的过程中，慢慢地朝着与反派最终对决的方向前进时，他们的领地会寻找盟友提供援助，调查反派及其手下的秘密，破坏反派领地的运作以削弱其力量，为最终决战做准备。即使是在当前正在进行冒险的战役中，玩家和主持人也可以采纳本书中的新规则，为战役中已有的情节和阴谋提供框架，然后提高英雄和敌人在战争中的赌注！",
	"The adventure included with this book—\"The Regent of Bedegar\"—serves as an example of how a straightforward adventure can include rewards such as military units or resistance to an opposing realm's features based on a domain's actions during the adventure.": "这本书附带的冒险——《贝德加的摄政王》—展示了一个简单冒险如何根据领地在冒险中的行动，赠送军事单位或对抗对方领域特征的抵抗力等奖励。",
	"{@i Kingdoms & Warfare} assumes that all the player characters in a campaign will be officers in a domain organization. These rules introduce a new dice pool (described below) shared by all the officers of an organization, which grants characters access to domain powers. Those new features are based on what type of organization the players choose, and require the players to communicate and cooperate as a team. (A villainous realm has its own dice pool that the leader and their lieutenants gain access to for their own domain powers.)": "{@i Kingdoms & Warfare} 假设在一个战役中，所有玩家角色都将成为领地组织中的官员。这些规则引入了一个新的骰池（如下所述），由组织中所有官员共享，为角色提供领地能力。这些新功能基于玩家选择的组织类型，并要求玩家之间进行沟通和团队合作。（一个邪恶领域有自己的骰池，领袖和其副手可以获得自己的领地能力。）",
	"A character can be an officer in more than one organization, but they can be involved only in one intrigue at a time and can benefit only from the effects of one party sheet at a time. (That's the record of a domain's stats, defenses, and features.) A wizard might be a member of the party's noble court organization and run their own arcane order on the side. But during an intrigue involving the noble court, the character is focused on that organization while their arcane order tends to its own affairs.": "一个角色可以在多个组织中担任官职，但一次只能参与一个阴谋，并且一次只能从一个团队表的效果中受益。(%num%)（这是领地统计数据、防御和特征的记录。）一个巫师可能是该队伍贵族法庭组织的成员，并在一旁经营自己的奥术秩序。但在涉及贵族法庭的阴谋中，角色将专注于该组织，而他们的奥术秩序则会处理自己的事务。",
	"An organization is a domain built around the officers who founded it—the player characters. The players decide what their characters' organization does, and who its initial allies and enemies are. Among those allies, an organization also includes the NPC followers, retainers, and lieutenants the characters attract as a result of rising fame or infamy earned through adventuring. For example, if the party's organization is an underworld syndicate, that organization includes all the members of the syndicate down to the lowest-level agents keeping their ears to the ground and feeding the characters information. Likewise, an organization set up as a noble court might include large numbers of farmers and laborers who rely on the heroes for protection, and who are ready to serve to show their thanks.": "一个组织是围绕着创立它的官员——玩家角色而建立的领域。玩家决定他们角色的组织做什么，以及它的最初盟友和敌人是谁。在这些盟友中，一个组织还包括角色通过冒险赢得的声望或恶名而吸引的NPC追随者、侍从和副手。例如，如果小组的组织是一个地下犯罪集团，那么该组织包括该集团的所有成员，甚至包括最低级别的特工，他们时刻留意动态并向角色提供信息。同样，一个设立为贵族法庭的组织可能包括大量依赖英雄保护的农民和劳工，他们愿意服务以表示感谢。",
	"Using the rules in this book, an adventuring party becomes an organization when it founds a stronghold, typically by buying, building, discovering, or inheriting it. Founding a stronghold announces to the world that the adventurers are more than just mercenaries, and are ready to get involved with local affairs in one way or another.": "根据这本书中的规则，当一个冒险小组建立了一个据点时，它就会成为一个组织，通常是通过购买、建造、发现或继承来实现。建立一个据点宣告给世界，冒险者不仅仅是雇佣兵，而且准备以某种方式参与当地事务。",
	"Each fully detailed domain (whether a player character organization or a villainous realm) is described by its collection of skills, defenses, domain powers, and domain features, as well as its size.": "每个完整详细的领域（无论是玩家角色组织还是邪恶领域）都由其技能、防御、领域能力和领域特征的集合描述，以及其规模。",
	"A domain has four {@b skills}: Diplomacy, Espionage, Lore, and Operations, each of which has a modifier. A domain's officers use these skills during intrigue.": "一个领域有四个{@b skills}：外交、间谍、知识和行动，每个都有一个修正值。一个领域的官员在阴谋中使用这些技能。",
	"A domain has three {@b defenses}: Communications, Resolve, and Resources. Each defense has a numerical value that provides a target number for tests made with domain skills during an intrigue. Each defense also has a level that can be raised or lowered. Any domains can gain bonuses or take penalties during battle or combat based on their domain defense levels.": "一个领域有三个{@b defenses}：传播 (Communications), 解决 (Resolve), 和资源 (Resources)。每个防御都有一个数值，为领域技能在阴谋中进行测试提供了一个目标数字。每个防御还有一个可以提高或降低的级别。任何领域在战斗或战斗中根据其领域防御级别可以获得奖励或受到惩罚。",
	"Each domain also grants its officers access to special {@b domain powers} they can use in combat. Each officer gets a {@b power die} that they roll at the beginning of any combat against one or more officers of an opposed domain. The roll goes into a {@b power pool} shared by all the officers of a domain, with these dice fueling each character's domain powers.": "每个领域还授予其官员特殊的{@b domain powers}，他们可以在战斗中使用。每位官员都会获得一个{@b power die}，他们在与对立领域的一个或多个官员进行任何战斗时进行投掷。投掷结果会进入一个{@b power pool}中，由该领域所有官员共享，这些骰子为每个角色的领域能力提供动力。",
	"Every domain also provides a number of unique {@b domain features} that officers can make use of during intrigue, allowing the domain to affect the opposed domain's defenses and units, to muster special units, and make other preparations for battle.": "每个领域还提供了一些独特的{@b domain features}，官员们可以在阴谋中利用这些{@b domain features}，使领域能够影响对立领域的防御和单位，召集特殊单位，并为战斗做其他准备。",
	"Finally, each domain has a {@b size} that determines how many turns it can take during intrigue, how large its officers' power dice are, and the scope of certain benefits available to the domain's army (as detailed in the {@book Warfare|KaW|3} chapter).": "最后，每个领地都有一个{@b size}，它决定了在阴谋中可以进行多少轮，官员的权力骰子有多大，以及领地军队可获得的某些好处的范围（详见{@book Warfare|KaW|3}章节）。",
	"Conflict between domains is called intrigue, and serves as the backdrop to the warfare battles that can play out between the heroes and the villains. The characters can use their organization's skills outside of intrigue, making use of Diplomacy to forge alliances, Espionage to gather intelligence, and so forth. But once the heroes decide it's time to act and stop the villain (or once the villain decides to stop the heroes), the GM announces that intrigue has begun as its own special phase of the game.": "领域之间的冲突被称为阴谋，它为英雄和反派之间可能发生的战争战斗提供了背景。角色可以利用他们组织的技能在阴谋之外，比如使用外交来建立联盟，间谍活动来收集情报等等。但一旦英雄们决定是时候行动并阻止反派（或者反派决定阻止英雄们），GM宣布阴谋已经开始，作为游戏的一个特殊阶段。",
	"Intrigue occurs between two domains—by default, the heroes' organization and the villain's enemy realm. NPC realms might also be involved, but they don't act on their own during intrigue. Rather, they lend aid to one side or the other.": "阴谋发生在两个领域之间——默认情况下是英雄组织和反派敌对领域。NPC 领域可能也会参与，但在阴谋中它们不会独自行动。相反，它们会向一方或另一方提供帮助。",
	"Intrigue is divided up into domain turns, during which the players and the GM make use of the domain features and special actions available to them. Intrigue ends once both sides have completed all their domain turns, at which point the GM will set up a final showdown between domains— involving combat between the characters and their enemies, a climactic battle between the armies of powerful domains, or both!": "阴谋被分为领地轮次，在此期间玩家和GM利用他们可以使用的领地特性和特殊行动。当双方都完成了他们的领地轮次后，阴谋就结束了，此时GM将安排领地之间的最终对决—包括角色与他们的敌人之间的战斗，强大领地军队之间的高潮战斗，或两者兼有！",
	"The players create an organization when their characters acquire a stronghold. They might do so by spending time and money to buy or build a stronghold, or through other means such as discovering an old ruin, clearing it out, and fixing it up. Some campaigns might even begin with the heroes inheriting a stronghold!": "当角色获得据点时，玩家们可以创建一个组织。他们可以通过花费时间和金钱购买或建造据点，或通过其他方式，比如发现一座古老废墟，清理并修复它来创建组织。有些冒险甚至可能以英雄们继承一座据点开始！",
	"The game's core rules note prices for different strongholds of different sizes, but there's also an entire book dedicated to this—{@book Strongholds & Followers|SaF}. (You don't need that book to use the rules in this book, but it might be fun.) ": "游戏的核心规则中记录了不同大小的据点的价格，但也有一整本书专门讨论这个——{@book Strongholds & Followers|SaF}。 (您不需要那本书来使用本书中的规则，但可能会很有趣。)",
	"Once the characters gain a stronghold, they naturally start to attract followers. Folks hear about the deeds they've done, notice the new headquarters, and volunteer to help or serve the characters. That stronghold and those followers are the foundation of the player characters' organization.": "一旦角色建立了根基，他们自然会开始吸引追随者。人们听说了他们的事迹，注意到了新总部，并自愿帮助或为角色服务。那个根基和那些追随者是玩家角色组织的基础。",
	"Of course, the GM can waive any of these requirements if doing so is a better fit for the campaign. The only thing that's really necessary is to have people working for the characters. But without some kind of headquarters, even if it's just the local tavern (an establishment according to the {@book Strongholds & Followers|SaF} rules), there's no physical structure to defend and nothing for an enemy to attack—and these things are important to the new rules in this book, as you will see.": "当然，如果这样做更适合战役，GM可以放宽这些要求中的任何一个。唯一真正必要的是让人们为角色工作。但是，即使只是当地的酒馆（根据{@book Strongholds & Followers|SaF}规则的一个设施），没有某种总部，就没有物理结构可供防御，也没有敌人可以攻击的东西——正如你将在本书中看到的，这些事情对于新规则非常重要。",
	"Eight different types of organizations for player character domains are presented in this book, and each of those has three specializations. Two of those organizations—the noble court and the adventuring party—are good for existing campaigns in which the players don't want to make new characters to use these rules, or for campaigns with a wide range of character types. The rest are themed more narrowly, and are best for new characters built around a specific organization type—and for parties where characters are focused on similar or even the same classes. (See {@b Granting Titles} below for more information.)": "本书中介绍了八种不同类型的玩家角色领地组织，每种组织都有三种专业化。其中两种组织——贵族法庭和冒险队——适合于现有的战役，玩家不想为了使用这些规则而制作新角色，或者适合于角色类型多样的战役。其余的组织更具特定主题，最适合围绕特定组织类型建立新角色——以及角色专注于相似甚至相同职业的团队。（有关更多信息，请参见{@b Granting Titles}。）",
	"That said, even the most strongly themed organizations don't make any assumptions about what classes officers can or should be. With only a few exceptions, none of the domain powers that officers can take make reference to class features. Any group of characters could decide to be a thieves' guild or a knightly order. After all, every criminal enterprise needs wizards and clerics, and you don't have to be a heavily armored and chivalrous paladin to follow a knight's creed.": "话虽如此，即使是主题最鲜明的组织也不会假设军官可以或应该是什么职业。除了少数例外，军官可以选择的领域能力中没有提到职业特性。任何一组角色都可以决定成为盗贼行会或骑士团。毕竟，每个犯罪组织都需要巫师和牧师，而你也不必是穿着厚重盔甲、遵循骑士信条的圣骑士才能成为骑士的信徒。",
	"Each organization is set up with a {@b party sheet} that defines the organization's starting skills, its defenses, its domain powers, and its domain features. The sheet even has a place for the characters' pool of power dice.": "每个组织都设有一个{@b party sheet}，用于定义组织的起始技能、防御、领域能力和领域特性。角色的力量骰池甚至也有专门的位置。",
	"When characters found an organization, they begin with {@b 8 development points}, which are available to spend on skills and defenses. The players take turns passing the party sheet around, with each player spending 1 point and checking off the appropriate blank box on the party sheet (see below) until all points have been spent.": "当角色创建一个组织时，他们从{@b 8 development points}开始，可以用于技能和防御。玩家轮流传递队伍表格，每位玩家花费1点并在队伍表格上勾选适当的空白框（见下文），直到所有点数都被花费完为止。",
	"Players can make choices for spending development points as a group, or each player can do what they like individually. The GM can also weigh in if necessary, depending on the circumstances of the campaign. For example, in a campaign where one character has inherited a barony from their parent and the other characters are the new baron's lieutenants, it might make sense for the new baron's player to spend most of the organization's initial development points. (That's less fun, though!)": "玩家可以作为一个团队来决定如何花费发展点，或者每个玩家可以个别行动。在必要时，GM也可以根据战役的情况进行干预。例如，在一个战役中，一个角色从父母那里继承了一个男爵领地，而其他角色则是新男爵的副手，这时新男爵的玩家可能更合理地花费组织的初始发展点。（尽管这样不太有趣！）",
	"Every time a domain levels up, the officers gain an additional 8 development points to spend on improving their organization. The players once more pass the sheet around, with each player spending 1 point until all points are spent.": "每次一个领域升级，官员们会获得额外的8个发展点，用于改善他们的组织。玩家们再次传递表格，每位玩家花费1点，直到所有点数都花完为止。",
	"Each development point spent lets a player mark off a box on the party sheet, moving to the right. When a box is marked off, the box on its right is marked off next. When a box with a value in it is marked off, the organization's skills or defenses become that number. For example, if an organization has +2 marked off in Diplomacy and the players mark off the next two boxes to reach +3, the organization's Diplomacy modifier increases to +3. If Resolve starts at 10 and the players mark off the next six boxes, the organization's Resolve increases to 15.": "每花费一个发展点，玩家可以在队伍表上标记一个方框，向右移动。当一个方框被标记时，它右边的方框会接着被标记。当一个带有数值的方框被标记时，组织的技能或防御变为该数字。例如，如果一个组织在外交上标记了+2，玩家标记下两个方框达到+3，那么组织的外交修正值将增加到+3。如果决心从10开始，玩家标记下接下来的六个方框，组织的决心值将增加到15。",
	"Each organization starts with its skills and defenses at specific values, representing what the organization is naturally good at based on its type. (See the Heroic Organizations section on page 31 for details.) Mark off the boxes with the starting values and all the boxes to the left of those boxes. Then players spending development points continue marking off boxes to the right.": "每个组织都从特定数值的技能和防御开始，这代表了该组织根据其类型天生擅长的领域。(详见第31页的英雄组织部分。)在起始数值的方框上打勾，以及所有在这些方框左侧的方框。然后，玩家花费发展点数继续在右侧的方框上打勾。",
	"Any time an effect changes a domain's skills or defenses, the effect always refers to the modifier, not the number of boxes. If a domain specialization grants an organization a +1 to Diplomacy, that means the domain's Diplomacy modifier increases by 1. Only development points are applied one box at a time.": "任何时候，当一个效果改变一个领域的技能或防御时，效果总是指的是修改值，而不是方框的数量。如果一个领域专长让一个组织在外交上获得+1，那意味着该领域的外交修正值增加了1。只有发展点是逐个方框应用的。",
	"As a setup for using the warfare rules, when the characters found an organization, the players immediately muster four Tier I units of their choice to start up their army, from any ancestry the GM agrees the organization has access to. Each unit must be controlled by an officer of the organization, and each officer can command a number of units equal to their proficiency bonus. (The {@book Warfare|KaW|3} chapter has more information on all these things.)": "作为使用战争规则的准备工作，当角色发现一个组织时，玩家们立即集结四个他们选择的一级部队，以启动他们的军队，可以从GM同意组织可以访问的任何血统中选择。每个部队必须由组织的军官控制，每个军官可以指挥数量等于他们熟练加值的部队。 (有关所有这些内容的更多信息，请参阅{@book Warfare|KaW|3}章节。)",
	"During intrigue, players can muster more units for their organization's army. Rules for this are covered under the {@b Operations} domain skill in this chapter (page 23) and {@b Building an Army} in the {@book Warfare|KaW|3} chapter (page 100).": "在阴谋中，玩家可以为他们组织的军队集结更多单位。有关此规则的详细信息在本章中的{@b Operations}领域技能（第23页）和{@book Warfare|KaW|3}章节中的{@b Building an Army}中有所涵盖。",
	"An army obeys the commands of an organization's officers, and can be deployed outside of intrigue or warfare for narrative purposes. As a rule, an army can perform any activity that an organization's officers could perform but which the characters are too high a level to bother with, from escorting a diplomat to quelling an uprising of cultists.": "一个军队服从组织的军官指挥，并可以出征，不仅限于阴谋或战争，为叙事目的。通常情况下，一个军队可以执行组织军官能够执行但角色级别太高而无需操心的任何活动，从护送外交官到镇压异教徒起义。",
	"The Operations domain skill can be used to resolve tasks an army performs outside of battle.": "操作领域技能可以用来解决军队在战斗之外执行的任务。",
	"Each organization grants its officers access to five titles that are distinct to each type of organization. Each character claims a different title within an organization, with that title granting new features and proficiencies. A character can have more than one title, but they can benefit from only one at a time, switching titles during a long rest. If a party includes more than five player characters, the GM can allow specific titles in an organization to be duplicated or allow a character to take a title from a different type of organization.": "每个组织为其官员提供了五个与该类型组织不同的头衔。每个角色在组织内拥有不同的头衔，该头衔赋予了新的特性和熟练加点。角色可以拥有多个头衔，但一次只能从中受益一个，在长休息期间可以切换头衔。如果一个队伍包括超过五名玩家角色，GM可以允许在一个组织中特定头衔的重复，或者允许一个角色选择来自不同类型组织的头衔。",
	"Most organizations' titles are designed to support playing an organization whose officers are all of the same class, by giving those officers a wider range of features. For example, in a normal game, a party consisting of all rogues will deal formidable damage and be very stealthy indeed! At the same time, though, the lack of a tank and a healer makes such a group more fragile and less versatile than a typical group of adventurers. But in a thieves' guild organization whose officers are all rogues, titles help shore up these deficiencies.": "大多数组织的头衔都是为了支持玩一个所有官员都是同一职业的组织，通过为这些官员提供更广泛的功能。例如，在一场普通游戏中，一个由所有盗贼组成的队伍将造成可观的伤害，并且非常擅长潜行！但与此同时，缺乏坦克和治疗者使得这样的团队比典型的冒险者团队更脆弱、更缺乏多样性。但在一个所有官员都是盗贼的盗贼行会组织中，头衔有助于弥补这些不足。",
	"As an optional rule, the GM might consider allowing titles only when the players create a single-class party. This isn't a strict requirement, but players and GMs should all be aware that some titles might become overpowered if stacked with similar benefits from class features or feats.": "作为一个可选规则，GM可以考虑只在玩家创建单职业职业团队时允许使用头衔。这并不是一个严格要求，但玩家和GM都应该意识到，如果与职业特性或专长的类似效果叠加，一些头衔可能会变得过于强大。",
	"This book is built around the iconic idea of the heroes fighting an adventure's villain in one or more epic bouts of combat, while outside the characters' or the villain's sanctum, a battle rages between the armies controlled by both sides. If the characters run an arcane order or a druid circle, their army might be composed of elementals or treants. A thieves' guild might hire mercenaries or field units of elite scouts, harriers, and sappers. But regardless of which organization the players choose, {@b the rules assume they have an army}. The battle that rages alongside the combat has a mechanical impact on the characters. When the army of one domain or the other wins a battle, the officers of the victorious domain gain a morale surge that offers a one-time benefit in combat.": "这本书围绕着英雄们与冒险故事中的反派进行一场或多场史诗般的战斗的标志性想法构建，而在人物或反派的圣所之外，双方控制的军队之间的战斗正在激烈进行。如果人物管理一个奥术秩序或德鲁伊圈，他们的军队可能由元素生物或树人组成。盗贼行会可能会雇佣雇佣兵或派出精英侦察兵、骚扰者和工兵部队。但无论玩家选择哪个组织，{@b the rules assume they have an army}。战斗与战斗并行进行的战斗对人物有机械影响。当一方领域的军队赢得一场战斗时，获胜领域的军官们会获得士气激增，为战斗提供一次性的好处。",
	"For some players, this idea fits the fantasy concept just fine. But for others, the idea of their characters' thieves' guild or arcane order fielding an army might seem strange, and out of line with their ambitions or style of play, or the way they imagine their organization. If this is ever the case, the players and the GM should feel free to ignore the warfare system in this book altogether. You can still use the intrigue system, and these rules will still work and be fun. Or you might try ignoring both warfare and intrigue to just use an organization's skills and powers! The power dice mechanic works well on its own, and will be fun even if the characters never raise an army.": "对于一些玩家来说，这个想法完全符合幻想概念。但对于其他人来说，他们角色的盗贼行会或奥术团体组建军队的想法可能看起来有些奇怪，与他们的抱负或游戏风格不符，或者与他们对组织的想象方式不一致。如果出现这种情况，玩家和GM应该可以放心地完全忽略本书中的战争系统。你仍然可以使用阴谋系统，这些规则仍然有效且有趣。或者你可以尝试忽略战争和阴谋，只使用组织的技能和力量！权力骰子机制本身运作良好，即使角色从未组建军队，也会很有趣。",
	"Even so, the GM is encouraged to describe the villain's realm as still having an army! But those forces will just be off doing something terrible in grand cinematic fashion (and possibly creating the reason the heroes need to stop the villain in the first place). Some sort of final combat still happens, with the heroes fighting the Scion of Orcus or Lord Saxton or what have you. But the villain's armies are busy wreaking havoc elsewhere.": "即便如此，鼓励GM描述反派的领地仍然拥有一支军队！但这些部队只会以宏伟的电影方式做一些可怕的事情（可能正是英雄们需要阻止反派的原因）。最终的战斗仍会发生，英雄们将与奥库斯的后裔或者萨克斯顿领主或其他人进行战斗。但反派的军队正在其他地方制造混乱。",
	"Domain-level play works the same way the skirmish-level game works. Just as each character has skills they can use outside of and during combat, an organization has skills it can use before and during intrigue. In the same way that characters decide to draw steel and initiate combat, an organization can decide to deploy its agents and begin intrigue. Likewise, the GM can decide, \"You've pushed this NPC far enough! It's time for intrigue!\" Or, \"This villainous realm has decided the party is an active threat, and they initiate intrigue!\"": "领域级游戏的运作方式与冲突级别游戏相同。就像每个角色都有战斗内外可以使用的技能一样，一个组织也有在和阴谋中可以使用的技能。就像角色决定拔剑并开始战斗一样，一个组织可以决定派遣它的特工并开始阴谋。同样，GM可以决定，“你已经逼迫这个NPC到极限了！是时候开始阴谋了！”或者，“这个邪恶的领域已经决定把这个队伍视为一个活跃的威胁，他们开始了阴谋！”",
	"In any event, the GM determines when intrigue begins, regardless of which side initiates it.": "在任何情况下，无论哪一方发起，(%(GM)游戏主持人%)决定阴谋开始的时间。",
	"Before intrigue begins, the characters' organization can probe and test their enemy, but {@b they can't use their skills directly against a villainous realm}. That kind of action is what begins intrigue. This is a fine line, and it's up to the GM to adjudicate it. But in general, if the characters can make use of their organization's skills to deal with everyday people (for example, learning something about a villainous realm by making general inquiries using Diplomacy) or known information (for example, researching a villain's history using Lore), then those activities can remain part of the regular game. (See below for more information on these domain skills and their use.)": "在阴谋开始之前，角色的组织可以调查和测试他们的敌人，但是{@b they can't use their skills directly against a villainous realm}。这种行为就是引发阴谋的开始。这是一个微妙的界限，由GM来裁决。但一般来说，如果角色可以利用他们组织的技能来处理日常人物（例如，通过外交进行一般性询问来了解邪恶领域的一些情况）或已知信息（例如，使用学识研究一个恶棍的历史），那么这些活动可以保持作为常规游戏的一部分。（有关这些领域技能及其使用的更多信息，请参见下文。）",
	"A Diplomacy test made against one of Lord Saxton's allies might provide some idea what kind of army he's preparing without starting intrigue. But an Espionage test to spy on Lord Saxton would initiate intrigue. Likewise, a Lore test to learn what Lord Saxton can do in combat might be allowable outside of intrigue if the GM decides Lord Saxton has shown off his combat skills often enough that there are people outside his domain who know that information. But any domain skill that requires targeting a villainous realm (including its agents, libraries, and lands) should start intrigue.": "进行一次针对萨克斯顿领主的盟友的外交(%num%)检定，也许能提供一些有关他正在准备何种军队的想法，而不会引发阴谋。但进行一次间谍(%num%)检定来监视萨克斯顿领主则会引发阴谋。同样，进行一次学识(%num%)检定以了解萨克斯顿领主在战斗中的能力，在GM决定萨克斯顿领主已经展示过足够多次他的战斗技能，以至于在他领地之外也有人知晓这些信息的情况下，可能是允许的。但任何需要针对一个邪恶领域（包括其特工、图书馆和土地）的领地技能都应该引发阴谋。",
	"A domain skill test works exactly like a character or creature making an ability check. A d20 is rolled, modifiers are added, and the total is compared to the test's Difficulty Class, determined by the GM. If the total is equal to or higher than the DC, the test succeeds. Tests can likewise be made with advantage and disadvantage, just like ability checks. The rules use the word test instead of check to help differentiate domain skills from the abilities and skills used by the characters.": "领域技能测试的工作方式与角色或生物进行能力检定完全相同。投掷一个d20，加上修正值，然后将总数与由GM确定的测试难度等级（DC）进行比较。如果总数等于或高于DC，则测试成功。测试也可以像能力检定一样具有优势和劣势。规则使用单词“测试”而不是“检定”来帮助区分领域技能和角色使用的能力和技能。",
	"Players don't have to wait until intrigue begins to use the skills of their characters' domain. A domain and its agents are always standing by, waiting for orders. For example, a Diplomacy test—along with some good roleplaying and effort on the characters' part—could change the attitude of a clan of elves toward an organization, so that once intrigue begins, the DC to convince the elves to aid the organization is lower.": "玩家们不必等到阴谋开始才能使用他们角色领地的技能。一个领地及其代理人总是待命，等待命令。例如，一次外交测试——再加上一些出色的角色扮演和角色努力——可能会改变精灵族群对一个组织的态度，这样一旦阴谋开始，说服精灵帮助该组织的难度等级会降低。",
	"Outside of their place in intrigue, there are no hard and fast rules describing how domain skills can be used. Players can suggest ideas, and if the GM agrees that an idea makes sense, they can try it! The goal with skills outside of intrigue is to keep the rules purposefully broad, so each table can develop their own standards.": "在阴谋之外，没有明确的规则描述领域技能如何使用。玩家可以提出想法，如果GM认为这个想法有道理，他们可以尝试！领域技能在阴谋之外的目标是故意保持规则宽泛，这样每个小组都可以制定自己的标准。",
	"How long it takes to resolve a domain skill test outside of intrigue is also up to the GM. A good rule of thumb is one domain skill test per week, but this is entirely dependent on the timeframe of the game and the campaign. If you don't track the passage of time closely in your game, it might be easier to tie domain skill tests to major narrative events, such as the awarding of XP to characters, the end of a session, or even the end of a major encounter. (See {@book Time and Domain Turns|KaW|2|Time and Domain Turns|0} below for more guidance in this area.)": "解决一个领域技能测试所需的时间也取决于GM。一个很好的经验法则是每周进行一次领域技能测试，但这完全取决于游戏和战役的时间框架。如果你在游戏中没有严格追踪时间的流逝，将领域技能测试与重大叙事事件联系起来可能更容易，比如奖励角色经验点、游戏会话结束，甚至是重大遭遇结束。 (有关此领域的更多指导，请参见{@book Time and Domain Turns|KaW|2|Time and Domain Turns|0}。)",
	"Regardless of how the GM rules, characters use their domain's skills by giving orders to the organization's followers and waiting, sometimes for days or even weeks of campaign time. During that time, those followers work to carry out those orders. Making an Espionage test to determine what military units a villainous realm has mustered can take an enormous amount of effort to pull off, including long days spent in research and networking.": "无论GM如何裁定，角色通过向组织的追随者下达命令并等待，有时需要数天甚至数周的战役时间，来使用他们领地的技能。在此期间，这些追随者会努力执行这些命令。进行间谍测试以确定一个邪恶领域集结了哪些军事单位可能需要付出巨大的努力，包括长时间的研究和社交。",
	"A villainous realm is defeated only when its leader is defeated in combat, whether that means death, or surrender, or stranding them in another part of the multiverse. The defeated realm's agents and followers might organize under a different leader later, but that will be a different domain with its own stats and features.": "只有当恶棍领袖在战斗中被击败时，那个邪恶领域才会被击败，无论是死亡、投降，还是被困在多元宇宙的另一个部分。被击败的领域的特工和追随者可能会在以后在不同的领袖下组织起来，但那将是一个拥有自己统计数据和特点的不同领域。",
	"Before the final showdown between the characters (in their roles of officers of their domain organization) and the officers of the villain's realm, the characters' organization conducts an intrigue against that realm. During intrigue, the players can use their organization's skills to put their army together, or sabotage certain elements of the opposed domain's power structure to impose penalties on its skills or defenses. At the same time, agents of the villainous realm are making their own attempts to weaken the characters' organization.": "在角色（扮演他们所在领域组织的官员）与反派领域的官员之间的最终对决之前，角色的组织对那个领域进行了一场阴谋。在阴谋中，玩家可以利用他们组织的技能来组建军队，或者破坏对立领域权力结构的某些元素，对其技能或防御施加惩罚。与此同时，反派领域的特工也在试图削弱角色的组织。",
	"Much like deciding when to call for initiative rolls in combat, the GM decides when intrigue starts. This usually happens once the heroes encounter one or more agents of the villainous realm, or the effects of those agents' villainy. This might occur at a different point in each adventure, but once the characters have direct evidence of the existence and operation of a villainous realm, intrigue can begin.": "就像决定何时在战斗中要求进行先攻骰时一样，GM决定何时开始阴谋。这通常发生在英雄们遭遇一个或多个邪恶领域的特工，或这些特工邪恶行为的影响时。这可能在每次冒险中的不同时间点发生，但一旦角色们有了邪恶领域存在和运作的直接证据，阴谋就可以开始。",
	"As a rule, the heroes' organization can't research or confront a villainous realm they don't know about, or which is beyond the reach of their influence. The characters can't use their friendly neighborhood thieves' guild to sabotage another domain on the other side of the planet.": "通常情况下，英雄组织不能研究或对抗他们不了解的邪恶领域，或者超出他们影响范围之外的领域。角色们不能利用他们友好的当地盗贼行会来破坏地球另一边的另一个领域。",
	"An intrigue is focused on one boss villain. A short adventure with only one main villain will likely have only one intrigue, which begins as soon as the heroes encounter the agents of that villain (and recognize them for what they are) or the results of their villainy. For complex campaigns in which the characters will face off against increasingly powerful sub-bosses before getting to the main boss, it's a good rule of thumb to plan for additional intrigues—perhaps even one per sub-boss. Each sub-boss fight can mark the end of a chapter or act, and will have its own intrigue leading up to it. As such, each sub-boss should be treated as the leader of their own villainous realm, in service to the end-boss's realm.": "一个阴谋集中在一个首要反派上。一个只有一个主要反派的短暂冒险可能只有一个阴谋，这个阴谋会在英雄们遭遇到那个反派的手下（并认出他们的真实身份）或者他们的恶行结果时开始。在复杂的战役中，角色将会先面对越来越强大的副首领，然后才能对抗主要反派，一个很好的经验法则是计划额外的阴谋——也许每个副首领都有一个。每场副首领的战斗可以标志着一个章节或者幕的结束，并且会有自己的阴谋引导。因此，每个副首领都应该被视为他们自己邪恶领域的领袖，为最终首领的领域服务。",
	"During an intrigue, each {@b domain can act a number of times equal to 4 + the domain's size}. Each time a domain acts during an intrigue is called a domain turn. This is true for the heroes' organization as well as the villain's realm.": "在阴谋中，每个{@b domain can act a number of times equal to 4 + the domain's size}。每次领地在阴谋中行动都被称为一个领地回合。这对英雄组织和反派领域都适用。",
	"During a domain turn, the characters' organization and the villainous realm act at the same time. The GM chooses a domain action for the villainous realm and keeps it secret. Then the characters choose a domain action for their organization. After the players declare the organization's domain action, the GM reveals the action of the villainous realm. Once actions are declared, the players roll any necessary skill tests for their characters' organization's domain action while the GM does the same for the villainous realm. Then the players share the results of their organization's actions followed by the GM sharing the villainous realm's results.": "在领域回合中，角色的组织和邪恶领域同时行动。GM 为邪恶领域选择一个领域行动并保密。然后角色选择他们组织的领域行动。玩家宣布组织的领域行动后，GM 揭示邪恶领域的行动。一旦行动宣布，玩家为他们角色的组织的领域行动进行任何必要的技能检定，同时GM 为邪恶领域做同样的检定。然后玩家分享他们组织行动的结果，GM 分享邪恶领域的结果。",
	"Spies from both domains monitor each other, so almost all actions a domain takes and the results of those actions are public knowledge. The exception is mustering units and using domain skills to improve a domain's stats (its domain skills and defenses). Enemies know when units are mustered or when a domain's stats are improved, but knowing which units a domain has or what the domain's current stats are requires a successful Espionage test. See {@b Domain Skills} on page 18 for more information.": "双方领域的间谍互相监视，因此几乎所有一个领域采取的行动以及这些行动的结果都是公开的。唯一的例外是集结单位和使用领域技能来提高领域的统计数据（其领域技能和防御）。敌人知道单位何时被集结或领域的统计数据被改善，但要知道一个领域拥有哪些单位或领域当前的统计数据，需要进行成功的间谍测试。有关更多信息，请参阅第{@b Domain Skills}页。",
	"Sometimes one domain in an intrigue has a greater domain size and can take more turns than the other. If the larger domain initiated the intrigue, those extra domain turns are taken at the start of the intrigue before the other domain can act. If the larger domain didn't initiate the intrigue, the extra domain turns are taken at the end of intrigue, after the other domain can no longer act.": "有时候，阴谋中的一个领域拥有更大的领域规模，可以采取比另一个更多的行动回合。如果较大的领域发起了阴谋，那些额外的领域回合会在阴谋开始时被执行，然后另一个领域才能行动。如果较大的领域没有发起阴谋，那些额外的领域回合会在阴谋结束后被执行，此时另一个领域已无法行动。",
	"When a domain takes a turn, one of its player character or NPC officers runs the domain turn, directing the domain to make use of its domain features, or to use domain skills as a domain action. Many features also involve the use of domain skills. When using a domain skill, if the officer is proficient with any of the domain skill's associated character skills, they can add their proficiency bonus to the skill test roll. However, this can be done only once per officer per intrigue.": "当一个领地轮到时，其中的玩家角色或NPC军官负责进行领地轮次，指导领地利用其领地特性，或者将领地技能作为领地行动。许多特性也涉及使用领地技能。当使用领地技能时，如果军官精通与领地技能相关的任何角色技能中的一项，他们可以将熟练加值加到技能检定中。然而，每位军官每次阴谋只能这样做一次。",
	"There are three domain action types: domain action, domain bonus action, and domain reaction. An officer can make one domain bonus action in addition to a domain action during a domain turn. Each officer can take only one domain reaction during an intrigue. Any domain reactions that an officer can make have specific triggers noted in their descriptions.": "有三种领域行动类型：领域行动，领域奖励行动和领域反应。一名军官可以在领域回合期间额外进行一次领域奖励行动。每位军官在一场阴谋中只能进行一次领域反应。军官可以进行的任何领域反应都有在其描述中注明的特定触发条件。",
	"Because domain features are used during intrigue, many of them relate directly to the warfare rules as they set up battles featuring the army of the characters' domain. The {@book Warfare|KaW|3} chapter (page 92) has more information on the rules and terminology referenced in those domain features.": "因为领地特征在阴谋中被使用，其中许多直接与战争规则相关，因为它们设置了以角色领地的军队为特色的战斗。第{@book Warfare|KaW|3}章（第92页）中有更多关于这些领地特征引用的规则和术语的信息。",
	"There is no limit to the number of rolls an officer can make during intrigue—only on the number of domain turns each domain can take. Each officer issues orders to the domain's agents and followers, which can easily require multiple domain turns. However, because only one of that officer's skill tests can gain the officer's proficiency bonus during an intrigue, it's best to have different characters and NPCs take domain turns. The more one character must spread their attention between different activities, the less effective their leadership.": "在阴谋中，官员可以进行的掷骰次数没有限制——只有每个领地可以进行的轮次数有限制。每位官员向领地的特工和追随者发布命令，这可能需要多个领地轮次。然而，在阴谋中，每位官员只能有一个技能检定可以获得官员的熟练加值，最好让不同的角色和NPC进行领地轮次。一个角色必须在不同活动之间分散注意力的越多，他们的领导力就越不有效。",
	"As noted above, the GM decides how often domains can take domain turns during regular adventuring. Intrigue begins when one domain threatens another; continues through periods of campaigning, battles, or both; and lasts until a final confrontation when the characters, the villains, and their armies face off for the last time. During the intrigue, an entire adventure might play out, featuring several encounters and multiple days or weeks of game time. One intrigue might last just a short period of time while another lasts a month or more, simply because of the different scope of the adventure.": "如上所述，GM决定领地在常规冒险中可以多久进行一次领地轮。阴谋开始于一个领地威胁另一个领地；持续到战役、战斗或两者同时发生的时期；并一直持续到最后一次决战，角色、反派和他们的军队最终面对面。在阴谋中，整个冒险可能会展开，包括多次遭遇和多天甚至几周的游戏时间。一个阴谋可能只持续很短的时间，而另一个可能会持续一个月甚至更长，这仅仅是因为冒险的不同范围。",
	"The GM should feel free to use any of the following options when deciding when and how often to call for new domain turns:": "当决定何时以及多久召唤新领地回合时，GM应该随意使用以下选项之一：",
	"One domain turn per week.": "每周进行一次领域转换。",
	"One domain turn per day.": "每天进行一次领域转换。",
	"One domain turn after each combat encounter.": "每次战斗遭遇后，一个领域转动。",
	"One domain turn per short rest, as the officers dash off orders to their agents.": "每次短休息一个领域转换，当官员们匆忙下达指令给他们的特工时。",
	"Two domain turns every time experience is awarded.": "每次获得经验时，两个领域轮换。",
	"The GM should also feel free to change these milestones on a per-adventure basis depending on how much time is passing. Or even to change them within an adventure to represent the changing pace of action! This might mean calling for two domain turns per day at the start, and then calling for a domain turn after every encounter as the end of intrigue gets closer. The final domain turn usually occurs just before the climactic confrontation begins!": "GM应该随时根据时间流逝的情况，自由地调整这些里程碑。甚至可以在冒险过程中更改它们，以反映行动节奏的变化！这可能意味着在开始时每天要进行两次领地回合，然后随着情节的发展，每次遭遇后都要进行一次领地回合。最后一次领地回合通常发生在戏剧性对抗开始之前！",
	"Ultimately, there's no wrong way to do this, and the GM should feel free to adapt how and when they call for domain turns to suit the adventure they're running and the ways in which they track time in their game.": "最终，没有一种错误的做法，GM应该随意调整何时如何要求领地轮次，以适应他们正在进行的冒险以及他们在游戏中跟踪时间的方式。",
	"Each domain has four skills: Diplomacy, Espionage, Lore, and Operations. These skills define how an organization or realm interacts with the world and with other domains. Skills can be used before and during intrigue. During intrigue, making a domain skill test is a domain action.": "每个领域都有四种技能：外交（Diplomacy）、间谍（Espionage）、知识（Lore）、和行动（Operations）。这些技能定义了一个组织或领域如何与世界和其他领域互动。这些技能可以在阴谋之前和期间使用。在阴谋期间，进行领域技能测试是一项领域行动。",
	"Each domain skill represents an entire department inside a domain, including followers and retainers who are experts in their fields. Those NPCs can mount operations on their own with just the direction of a domain's officers, with those operations not requiring any direct involvement of the heroes or the villain. As such, not only do domain skills allow a domain to do things while the characters are adventuring, they allow the domain to do things outside the scope of adventuring, from research to sabotage to negotiation.": "每个领域技能代表着领域内的一个完整部门，包括专业领域内的追随者和侍从。这些NPC可以独立进行行动，只需领域官员的指导，这些行动不需要英雄或反派直接参与。因此，领域技能不仅让领域在角色冒险时能够开展活动，还让领域在冒险范围之外进行各种活动，从研究到破坏到谈判。",
	"Players are encouraged to be creative with their domain's skills, the same way players can improvise how they use a character's abilities and skills. Don't worry about \"doing it right.\" Each group will develop their own standards for which skills are best and what the appropriate defense or DC is, in much the same way each table develops its own sense of when Dexterity (Acrobatics) is preferable to Strength (Athletics).": "鼓励玩家在使用领地技能时发挥创造力，就像他们可以灵活运用角色的能力和技能一样。不必担心“做对与否”。每个团队都会制定自己的标准，确定哪些技能最适合，以及适当的防御或难度等级，就像每个游戏桌会形成自己的判断标准，判断何时灵巧（体操）比力量（竞技）更合适一样。",
	"During intrigue, each skill can be used to improve a domain's defense levels or to target the opposed domain and reduce its defense levels. But it's up to the players and the GM to imagine how this plays out, by translating skill tests and their effects into game terms.": "在阴谋中，每种技能都可以用来提高领地的防御级别，或者针对对立的领地并降低其防御级别。但这取决于玩家和GM如何想象这种情况，将技能测试及其效果转化为游戏术语。",
	"Once intrigue begins, each domain involved in the intrigue prepares for some sort of final confrontation between their officers—the player character heroes versus the GM's villain and their lieutenants. Each side can use domain actions to make use of their domain skills, with the goal of either improving a domain's defense levels, or of targeting the opposed side's defenses to make them less prepared for the warfare battles that take place during intrigue.": "一旦阴谋开始，每个参与阴谋的领域都为他们的军官——玩家角色英雄与GM的反派及其副手之间的某种最终对抗做准备。每一方都可以使用领域行动来利用他们的领域技能，目标要么是提高领域的防御级别，要么是瞄准对立方的防御，使他们在阴谋中进行的战争战斗中准备不足。",
	"Each domain has three defenses—{@b Communications}, {@b Resolve}, and {@b Resources}—each of which is rated at a level from 3 to −3 (as described in detail under {@book Domain Defenses|KaW|2|Domain Defenses} on page 24). {@b The DC to improve one of a domain's defense levels is 13 + the defense's current level.} So a domain skill test to take its Resolve level from normal (level 0) to loyal (level 1) has a DC of 13. Improving Resolve level from loyal (level 1) to fanatic (level 2) is a DC 14 check, and going from revolt (level −3) to rebellious (level −2) is DC 10. The level of any defense cannot be increased above 3.": "每个领域都有三种防御—{@b Communications}、{@b Resolve}和{@b Resources}—每种防御都被评级为从3到-3级（详细描述在第24页的{@book Domain Defenses|KaW|2|Domain Defenses}下）。{@b The DC to improve one of a domain's defense levels is 13 + the defense's current level.} 因此，将领域技能测试的坚决程度从正常（级别0）提升到忠诚（级别1）的DC为13。将坚决程度从忠诚（级别1）提升到狂热（级别2）的DC为14，而从叛乱（级别-3）提升到叛逆（级别-2）的DC为10。任何防御的级别不能超过3。",
	"When the players want to affect one of their organization's defense levels using a domain skill, an acting officer chooses the intended defense level, a skill, and sets out how that skill is to be used. For example, Anna (playing a character named Judge) wants to raise the Communications level of her group's mercenary company, the Chain of Acheron, using that organization's Espionage domain skill. She tells the GM: \"I want to require all our agents to use only verbal communications, nothing written down, and to use our secret battle language.\"": "当玩家想要利用领域技能影响其组织的防御等级时，一名执法官选择预期的防御等级、技能，并说明如何使用该技能。例如，安娜（扮演一个名为法官的角色）想要利用组织的间谍领域技能，提升她所在团队的雇佣公司——阿克隆之链（Chain of Acheron）的通讯等级。她告诉GM：“我想要要求我们所有特工只使用口头通讯，不留任何书面记录，并使用我们的秘密战斗语言。”",
	"This is a great idea—but it's not necessarily easy to implement. The Chain of Acheron has a lot of soldiers, agents, and allies in the city, so there's no guarantee that these orders will work well enough to make a difference. To make the domain skill test, Anna rolls a d20 and adds the Espionage bonus for Acheron's Chain. She also adds Judge's proficiency bonus, since Judge is proficient in Investigation and has not already used their bonus during this intrigue. (See the domain skill descriptions below for more information on associated character skills.)": "这是一个很好的主意，但实施起来并不一定容易。阿克隆之链有很多士兵、特工和盟友在这座城市，所以不能保证这些命令能够起到足够的作用。为了进行领地技能检定，安娜投掷一枚20面骰，并加上阿克隆之链的间谍奖励。她还加上法官的熟练奖励，因为法官精通侦查并且在这场阴谋中还没有使用过他们的奖励。（有关相关角色技能的更多信息，请参阅下面的领地技能描述。）",
	"The Chain of Acheron's Communications defense is currently secure (level 1), which sets the check as DC 14. If Anna succeeds, the domain's Communications goes up one level. If she rolls badly, Communications remains secure but does not improve, with the GM likely interpreting this as meaning Judge's plans were too ambitious.": "阿克罗恩之链的通讯防御目前是安全的（等级1），这将设定检定 DC 14。如果安娜成功，该领域的通讯等级将提升一级。如果她掷骰子不好，通讯保持安全但不会改善，GM可能会解释为裁判的计划过于雄心勃勃。",
	"A defense level can normally be improved only by one level by making a domain skill test as a domain action. However, if a player rolls a 20 on the test, this represents an unexpectedly successful result that improves the defense by two levels.": "通过进行一个领域技能测试作为领域行动，通常只能将防御等级提高一个等级。然而，如果玩家在测试中掷出20，这代表意外成功的结果，可以将防御提高两个等级。",
	"Villainous realms can increase their defense levels the same way, with the GM making the decision as to which officer, skill, and specific approach are involved.": "恶棍领域可以通过相同的方式增加它们的防御等级，由主持人决定涉及哪位军官、技能和具体方法。",
	"In the same manner, the players can target a villainous realm in the hopes of lowering that domain's defense levels. An acting officer picks a skill and one of the opposed domain's defenses, then describes how they intend to use that skill to compromise the defense. If the scenario makes sense to the GM, the officer rolls a d20, adds the domain skill's modifier, adds their proficiency bonus if applicable, and compares the result with the enemy realm's defense score. If the result is equal to or greater than the chosen defense's score, that defense is lowered one level. If the player rolls a 20 on the check, the chosen defense is lowered two levels. The level of any defense cannot be decreased below −3.": "以相同的方式，玩家可以瞄准一个邪恶领域，希望降低该领域的防御等级。 一名执法官选择一个技能和对立领域的防御之一，然后描述他们打算如何利用该技能来破坏防御。 如果情景对GM有意义，执法官投掷一枚d20，加上领域技能的修正值，如果适用，再加上他们的熟练加值，并将结果与敌方领域的防御得分进行比较。 如果结果等于或大于所选防御的得分，则该防御降低一个等级。 如果玩家在检定中掷出20，所选防御将降低两个等级。 任何防御的等级不能降低到低于-3。",
	"Villainous realms can target the defenses of the heroes' organization in the same way, with the GM making the decision as to which officer, skill, and specific approach are involved.": "邪恶领域可以以同样的方式瞄准英雄组织的防御，由GM决定涉及哪位官员、技能和具体方法。",
	"The only limit to what benefits characters can earn through the use of their domain skills is the players' imaginations and the GM's sense of what's fair and reasonable. Each skill gives some ideas of what can be done with it, and a GM should refer to the DCs noted in the core rules when trying to set difficulties for an optimal balance between what's realistic and what's dramatic.": "角色通过运用领域技能所能获得的好处的唯一限制是玩家的想象力和(`GM`)的公平和合理的判断。每种技能都提供了一些可以做的想法，(`GM`)在设定困难度时应参考核心规则中注明的(`DCs`)，以实现现实和戏剧之间的最佳平衡。",
	"The Diplomacy domain skill represents a domain's ability to get what it wants without resorting to war or espionage. It's primarily used to make alliances with other domains. An alliance is not a mechanical notion, but is just an agreement between two domains. The terms of the agreement are up to the officers of each domain, but usually an alliance means that two domains each agree to help the other in times of conflict.": "外交领域技能代表了一个领域在不诉诸战争或间谍活动的情况下获得所需的能力。它主要用于与其他领域建立联盟。联盟并非机械概念，而只是两个领域之间的协议。协议的条款由每个领域的官员决定，但通常意味着两个领域同意在冲突时互相帮助。",
	"Some alliances are purely defensive. \"We agree to go to war against an enemy who attacks either of us.\" More rarely, alliances can be offensive. \"Lord Saxton must be stopped! Will you help us?\" Offensive alliances are more difficult to establish, though, and another domain might require great assurances before entering into one. \"We might attack Lord Saxton if things are as you say. But what proof can you offer that Saxton is a villain?\"": "一些联盟纯粹是防御性的。“我们同意对抗攻击我们任何一方的敌人。”更少见的是，联盟也可以是进攻性的。“Saxton领主必须被阻止！你会帮助我们吗？”然而，进攻性的联盟更难建立，另一个领域可能需要提供充分的保证才会加入。“如果情况如你所说，我们可能会攻击Saxton领主。但你能提供什么证据证明Saxton是个恶棍呢？”",
	"As a domain action, a domain can make a Diplomacy test to petition an NPC realm for military aid for an upcoming battle. The DC depends on the attitude of the NPC realm, as noted on the following table.": "作为领域行动，领域可以进行一次外交检定，向NPC领域请求在即将到来的战斗中提供军事援助。检定 DC 取决于NPC领域的态度，如下表所示。",
	"Hostile": "敌对 (Hostile)",
	"Suspicious": "可疑 (Suspicious)",
	"Neutral": "中立 (Neutral)",
	"Friendly": "友好",
	"Allied": "联军 (Allied)",
	"This Diplomacy test can be used more than once per intrigue, but each NPC realm can only grant one unit per intrigue.": "这个外交测试可以在每次阴谋中使用多次，但每个NPC领域每次阴谋只能授予一个单位。",
	"Each NPC realm has a special unit that another domain can gain as a result of an alliance. This is the same special unit the domain can muster using a domain action, as noted in its description. For example, a successful Diplomacy test made by the characters' organization to seek aid from a giant jarldom NPC realm gets the organization a Pet Roc special unit to command in an upcoming battle. Each NPC realm has only one special unit to provide, so characters had better recruit them before their enemies do! A special unit gained through an alliance with an NPC realm returns to the NPC realm after the battle in which it is used.": "每个NPC领域都有一个特殊单位，另一个领域可以通过结盟获得。这个特殊单位与该领域可以通过领域行动召集的特殊单位相同，如其描述中所述。例如，角色组织通过进行一次成功的外交测试，寻求来自一个巨人领地NPC领域的援助，组织将在即将到来的战斗中指挥一支宠物Roc特殊单位。每个NPC领域只能提供一个特殊单位，所以角色最好在他们的敌人之前招募它们！通过与NPC领域结盟获得的特殊单位在使用它的战斗结束后会返回给NPC领域。",
	"A hostile NPC realm is not the same thing as a villainous realm. A villainous realm is actively trying to destroy the heroes' organization, whereas a hostile realm is merely one with a tradition of enmity toward the heroes' domain or other domains like it. A local druid circle might have a troubled history with a noble court that rules the land near their forest, creating potential problems for the different noble court run by the characters even if the characters have never interacted with the druids before.": "一个敌对的NPC领域并不等同于一个恶棍的领域。一个恶棍的领域积极地试图摧毁英雄组织，而一个敌对的领域仅仅是对英雄领域或类似领域保持敌意传统。一个当地的德鲁伊圈可能与统治他们森林附近土地的贵族法庭有着麻烦的历史，这可能会给角色们管理的不同贵族法庭带来问题，即使这些角色之前从未与德鲁伊互动过。",
	"At the GM's discretion, a realm that is allied with the characters' organization can send units to aid the organization in battle even without a Diplomacy test. But sometimes allies are busy or occupied with other conflicts, in which case the GM will ask for a test to be made.": "在（GM）的裁量下，与角色组织结盟的领域可以派遣部队在没有外交测试的情况下协助组织参加战斗。但有时盟友可能忙碌或卷入其他冲突，这种情况下（GM）会要求进行一次测试。",
	"Diplomacy can also be used to convince an NPC realm currently allied with an enemy to sit a battle out, or to convince a neutral realm to lend aid beyond units. Such aid might include a powerful lieutenant, or information that would benefit the domain requesting assistance.": "外交也可以用来说服一个NPC领域，该领域目前与敌人结盟，让他们在战斗中保持中立，或者说服一个中立领域提供超出单位之外的援助。这种援助可能包括一个强大的副手，或者有利于请求援助领域的信息。",
	"If a domain fails a Diplomacy test to influence or gain allies from an NPC realm, the domain can make a new Diplomacy test to achieve the same goal on a new domain turn. However, if a Diplomacy test fails by 5 or more, the NPC realm's attitude toward the Domain moves one step toward hostile.": "如果一个领地在与NPC领域进行外交测试以影响或获得盟友时失败，该领地可以在新的领地回合上进行新的外交测试以实现相同的目标。然而，如果外交测试失败了5点或更多，NPC领域对该领地的态度会向敌对方向移动一步。",
	"Espionage allows a domain to learn the secrets of other domains, including their plans, their current activities, and who they are allied with. Successful Espionage tests often decrease the level of an opposing domain's Communications defense, reflecting how successful attempts at destabilizing the opposed domain have been.": "间谍活动允许一个领域了解其他领域的秘密，包括它们的计划、当前活动以及它们与谁结盟。成功的间谍测试通常会降低对方领域的(%num%)通讯防御级别，反映了对对立领域破坏尝试的成功程度。",
	"Espionage can be used to learn the makeup of an opposed domain's units and the disposition of its allies in advance of a battle. The DC is usually set by targeting one of the opposed domain's defenses, but the GM can also set a DC arbitrarily (as per the guidelines for setting difficulty in the core rules). Espionage does not reveal the nature of specific magic in use by an opposed domain, but it might reveal that an opposed domain has some magical resources or secrets, which a successful Lore test can then ferret out.": "间谍活动可以用来了解对立领域单位的构成以及盟友的部署，以便在战斗之前提前了解情况。难度等级通常由瞄准对立领域的防御来设定，但GM也可以任意设定难度等级（根据核心规则中设定难度的指导方针）。间谍活动不会揭示对立领域正在使用的具体魔法性质，但可能会揭示对立领域拥有一些魔法资源或秘密，而成功的学识检定可以找出这些信息。",
	"When an opposed domain makes a skill test to muster units or raise its defenses, the GM doesn't automatically reveal the specifics of a successful result. The characters learn that the opposed domain mustered units, but not how many units or what kind. Likewise, the specifics of which defense was raised and by how much remain a mystery. If the characters want to know these things, they need to make a successful Espionage test as a domain action, typically against the opposed domain's Communications. On a success, the players can choose to know one of the following pieces of information:": "当对立领域进行技能测试以集结单位或提升其防御时，GM不会自动透露成功结果的具体细节。角色会得知对立领域集结了单位，但不会知道有多少单位或是什么类型的单位。同样，提升了哪种防御以及提升了多少也会保持神秘。如果角色想要了解这些信息，他们需要进行一次成功的间谍测试作为领域行动，通常对抗对立领域的(Communications)。成功后，玩家可以选择了解以下信息中的一项：",
	"The target domain's current defense scores": "目标领域的当前防御分数 (The target domain's current defense scores)",
	"The target domain's current defense levels": "目标领域当前的防御水平 (the target domain's current defense levels)",
	"The target domain's skill bonuses": "目标领域的技能加值 (%num%)",
	"The target domain's current units": "目标领域的当前单位 (the target domain)",
	"Another statistic or piece of information, at the GM's discretion": "另一项统计数据或信息，由GM自行决定",
	"Knowing the kinds of units an opposed domain has mustered helps a domain plan its own army. For example, if a villainous realm is building aerial units, the characters' organization will want some aerial units or artillery of their own to take them on. Likewise, if an opposed domain keeps boosting its Resources defense levels, the characters might decide to try to lower that defense and undo some of that progress!": "了解对立领域集结了哪些单位有助于一个领域规划自己的军队。例如，如果一个邪恶领域正在建造空中单位，角色组织将希望拥有一些自己的空中单位或火炮来对抗它们。同样，如果对立领域不断增强其资源防御水平，角色们可能决定尝试降低该防御并撤销部分进展！",
	"If a domain feature requires a domain to know a secret piece of information to work properly, then the domain learns the information when they successfully use the feature. A separate Espionage test is not necessary. For example, a fey court domain can duplicate an opposed domain's highest-tier unit with the Your Own Worst Enemy feature. When the court succeeds on the Lore test to use the feature, they automatically learn what the target domain's highest-tier unit is.": "如果一个领域特性需要领域知道一段秘密信息才能正常工作，那么当他们成功使用该特性时，领域会学到这个信息。不需要进行额外的间谍测试。例如，(精灵宫廷)领域可以使用“你是自己最大的敌人”特性复制对立领域的最高级单位。当宫廷在使用该特性时通过学识测试成功，他们会自动了解目标领域的最高级单位是什么。",
	"Lore represents a domain's ability to research both magical and historical knowledge. This is a broad and wide-ranging skill, which can be used outside of intrigue to unlock arcane discoveries, dig up the details of forgotten history, discover the existence of lost spells, or reveal the answers to ancient mysteries. The only limit on what a Lore check can accomplish is what the GM rules is reasonable.": "学识代表了一个领域研究魔法和历史知识的能力。这是一项广泛而涵盖范围广泛的技能，可以在阴谋之外使用，解锁奥秘发现，挖掘被遗忘历史的细节，发现失落法术的存在，或揭示古代谜团的答案。学识检定能够实现的唯一限制是GM认为合理的范围。",
	"As a rule, the Lore domain skill should not be used as a substitute for adventuring. But at the GM's discretion, it can be used to supplement the normal adventures of a domain's player character officers. For example, a team of NPC agents might be sent out to recover the legendary headpiece for the Staff of Ra, even as the characters quest after the location of the map room in the hidden Well of Souls. In general, if it would be easy but time-consuming for a domain's officers to acquire important knowledge or rare antiquities, then the Lore domain skill can be used to delegate that task. But if doing so is merely difficult, then the officers should undertake that task themselves.": "作为规则，(Lore)领域技能不应该被用来替代冒险。但在GM的酌情下，它可以被用来补充领域玩家角色官员的正常冒险。例如，一队NPC特工可能被派出去寻找传说中的Staff of Ra的头饰，而角色们则在寻找隐藏的灵魂之井中的地图室的位置。一般来说，如果对于领域官员来说获取重要知识或稀有古董是容易但耗时的，那么(Lore)领域技能可以被用来委派这项任务。但如果这样做仅仅是困难的，那么官员们应该自己承担这项任务。",
	"Lore can be used to learn an opposed domain's secrets when those secrets are explicitly magical, such as the nature of supernatural attacks or defenses, or the presence of any famous magic items or artifacts in a domain's arsenal. Likewise, the presence and features of extraordinary units in a domain's army is something a Lore test can ferret out.": "当这些秘密明确涉及魔法时，比如超自然攻击或防御的性质，或者一个领域的军械中是否有任何著名的魔法物品或神器，学识可以用来了解对立领域的秘密。同样，学识测试可以揭示一个领域军队中非凡单位的存在和特征。",
	"Operations represents a domain's ability to muster new units, as well as to perform many of the basic functions of maintaining a domain. This is intended to be a catchall domain skill for any activity the players or GM might think of that doesn't easily fit into another skill.": "运营代表了领域集结新单位的能力，以及执行维护领域许多基本功能的能力。这旨在成为一个全能领域技能，适用于玩家或GM可能想到的任何不容易归入其他技能范畴的活动。",
	"Heroic organizations and NPC realms can acquire strongholds and other fortifications during the course of a campaign in any number of ways. The characters might seize enemy fortifications after a successful battle (or have their own fortifications seized by a villainous realm), claim fortifications as a reward for adventuring, or find some other means of acquiring an existing fortified site.": "在战役过程中，英雄组织和NPC领域可以通过多种方式获得要塞和其他防御工事。角色们可能在成功战斗后夺取敌方要塞（或者他们自己的要塞被邪恶领域夺取），作为冒险的奖励声称要塞，或者找到其他方式获取现有的设防场所。",
	"A domain can also build specific battle-ready fortifications (as discussed in {@b Fortifications} in the {@book Warfare|KaW|3} chapter) in any space on a battlefield the domain controls. Doing so during intrigue requires a successful Operations test made as a domain action.

Multiple fences and towers can then be put together in different configurations to build castles, keeps, and other fortifications.": "领地还可以在领地控制的战场上的任何空间中建造特定的战斗准备工事（如在{@b Fortifications}章节中讨论的）。在阴谋中这样做需要进行一次成功的运营测试，作为领地行动。建造石墙需要进行一次成功的DC 11测试，而建造塔楼则需要进行一次成功的DC 13测试。然后可以将多个围墙和塔楼以不同的配置组合在一起，建造城堡、要塞和其他工事。",

	"Every domain has three defenses, all of which can be targeted by an opposing domain: {@b Communications}, {@b Resolve}, and {@b Resources}. Defenses operate at one of seven levels, each of which has a name and a numerical rating from 3 to −3. A defense's level represents how robust and functional that defense is at any given moment.

	"At each level above normal (level 0), the level benefits for a defense are cumulative with the levels below. For example, if a domain's Communications levels are unbreakable (level 3), that domain gains all the bonuses for secure, coded, and unbreakable Communications.

	"At the beginning of intrigue, all of a domain's defenses start at level 0. The players and the GM can use domain actions during intrigue to raise the level of a domain's defenses or to lower the levels of an opposed domain's defenses (see {@book Adjusting Defense Levels|KaW|2|Adjusting Defense Levels} on page 19). The level of any defense cannot be increased above 3 or decreased below −3.": "在阴谋开始时，所有领地的防御都从级别0开始。玩家和GM可以在阴谋中使用领地行动来提升领地防御的级别，或者降低对立领地防御的级别（见第19页的{@book Adjusting Defense Levels|KaW|2|Adjusting Defense Levels}）。任何防御的级别不能超过3或低于-3。",

	"The Communications defense is a measure of how rapidly and accurately information is transmitted between a domain's officers and followers. Every domain, from a hard-as-nails mercenary company to a grove of peaceful druids, relies on its network of followers, retainers, and servants to accomplish its goals. And without effective communications, those goals can easily break down.": "通讯防御是衡量信息在领地的官员和追随者之间传递的速度和准确性的一种措施。每个领地，无论是一支强硬的雇佣兵公司还是一片和平德鲁伊树林，都依赖于其追随者、侍从和仆人的网络来实现其目标。没有有效的沟通，这些目标很容易瓦解。",

	"A domain's Resolve has a direct effect on its officers. If everyone working for the domain is committed and engaged, it makes training easier and gives followers hope and confidence in victory. But the reverse is equally true. If everyone working for a domain is convinced of the domain's imminent failure, it makes training more exhausting and affects officer confidence. High Resolve means that a domain's officers are energized, coordinated, and convinced of victory, granting benefits to those officers in combat against the officers of an opposed domain. Poor resolve means that officers are distracted and tired, and their performance against foes from an opposed domain will suffer.": "一个领地的决心直接影响着它的官员。如果所有为领地工作的人都全力以赴、投入其中，那么训练会更容易进行，并且会给追随者希望和对胜利的信心。但反之亦然。如果所有为领地工作的人都确信领地即将失败，那么训练会变得更加劳累，并影响官员的信心。高决心意味着领地的官员充满活力、协调一致，并坚信胜利，这将使官员在与对立领地的官员作战时获得好处。决心不足意味着官员会分心和疲惫，他们在与对立领地的敌人作战时的表现会受到影响。",

Any officer can choose to roll their power die immediately after they roll initiative at the start of any combat (no action required). Once a power die is rolled, it cannot be rolled again until the officer who rolled it finishes an extended rest.

	"When a player or GM activates a domain power, the rules for that power sometimes instruct them to decrement the power die, usually at the end of each turn of the character who used the power.

This allows for the creation of nefarious holy churches, druid circles, and mercenary companies, in addition to the traditionally antagonistic realms of despotic regimes, fey courts, and others.": "GM从{@book NPC Realms|KaW|2|NPC Realms}部分选择一个领域类型，或者从本章后面介绍的领域类型中选择一个领域和一个专业化（均在后文中）。这样可以创建邪恶的神圣教堂、德鲁伊圈子和雇佣公司，除了传统上对立的专制政权、精灵法庭等领域。",
	"The GM chooses the domain size of the villainous realm. In most cases, it's best to set the realm's size within 1 of the size of the characters' organization by the time both sides get into an intrigue.": "GM选择邪恶领域的规模。在大多数情况下，最好将领域的大小设置为与角色组织的大小相差不超过1，直到双方陷入纷争。",
	"The GM spends development points improving the villainous realm's skills and defenses. The GM has a number of points to spend equal to 8 × the villainous realm's domain size.": "GM花费发展点数来提升邪恶领域的技能和防御。GM有可用点数，数量等于邪恶领域的领域大小(%num%)的8倍。",
	"The GM picks stat blocks for the villainous realm's leader and lieutenants, and gives one of the domain's titles to the leader. (If the domain has been chosen from the {@book NPC Realms|KaW|2|NPC Realms} section, it has only one title.) The lieutenants of the realm do not get titles (because the GM already has enough to worry about), but all officers might have access to the realm's domain powers and domain features.": "GM为邪恶领地的领袖和副手选择属性块，并将一个领地的头衔赋予领袖。(如果领地是从{@book NPC Realms|KaW|2|NPC Realms}部分选择的，则只有一个头衔。) 领地的副手们没有头衔(因为GM已经有足够的事情要担心了)，但所有官员可能都可以访问领地的领域力量和领域特性。",
	"The GM picks a stronghold for the villainous realm.": "GM 选择一个堡垒作为邪恶领域的根据地。",
	"For example, consider a group of heroes running a size 2 holy church. With that organization's latest foes vanquished, the GM wants to reveal the vampire Countess Sanguin's villainous realm, which has observed the characters' last battle from the shadows and wants to remove the threat their organization poses. The GM knows that Sanguin's servants include vampire spawn, wights, and other undead, so they make the villainous realm an undead dominion (page 86). Since Sanguin's domain has been established for some time, the GM makes it size 3. It poses a threat to the heroes' organization, but not an overwhelming one.": "例如，考虑一个由一群英雄经营的大小为2的神圣教堂。随着该组织最新的敌人被打败，GM希望揭示吸血鬼伯爵桑格因的邪恶领地，后者从阴影中观察了角色们的最后一场战斗，并希望消除他们的组织所构成的威胁。GM知道桑格因的仆人包括吸血鬼子嗣、尸鬼和其他不死生物，因此他们将邪恶领地设定为一个不死领土（第86页）。由于桑格因的领地已经建立了一段时间，GM将其规模设定为3。它对英雄组织构成威胁，但不是不可抗拒的威胁。",
	"The GM then spends 24 development points to improve the undead dominion's domain skills and defenses, using the same party sheet the players use for the characters' domain. They choose the {@creature vampire} stat block for Countess Sanguin and give her the deathlord title. The GM gives Sanguin three {@creature vampire spawn} lieutenants and names each of them, then gives the undead dominion a stronghold: an ancient castle.": "然后GM花费24个发展点来提升不死领地的领地技能和防御，使用玩家用于角色领地的同一团队表。他们选择{@creature vampire}的统计数据表格作为Sanguin女伯爵，并赋予她死亡领主的头衔。GM给了Sanguin三名{@creature vampire spawn}副官，并为每个人命名，然后给了不死领地一个据点：一座古老的城堡。",
	"Building an NPC realm is easier than building a heroic organization or a villainous realm, because NPC realms don't directly influence intrigue or battles. They might be persuaded by the characters' organization or the villainous realm to lend aid during a battle, but the GM can easily set that up without finalizing all of an NPC realm's stats. (That said, a GM is free to flesh out any NPC realm with the same level of detail as a villainous realm—especially if the NPC realm has enemy potential!)": "建立一个NPC领域比建立一个英雄组织或邪恶领域更容易，因为NPC领域不直接影响阴谋或战斗。他们可能会被角色的组织或邪恶领域说服，在战斗中提供帮助，但GM可以很容易地设置这一点，而不必最终确定所有NPC领域的统计数据。 （也就是说，GM可以自由地为任何NPC领域提供与邪恶领域相同级别的细节—特别是如果NPC领域具有敌对潜力！）",
	"The baseline process for creating an NPC realm is as follows:": "创建NPC领域的基本流程如下：",
	"As with creating a villainous realm, the GM picks either a domain and a specialization from the {@book Heroic Organizations|KaW|2|Heroic Organizations} section or a domain from the {@book NPC Realms|KaW|2|NPC Realms} section. This choice doesn't imply a specific role for the NPC realm, though, which might be friendly or antagonistic toward the characters' organization as the GM decides.": "在创建一个邪恶领域时，GM要么从{@book Heroic Organizations|KaW|2|Heroic Organizations}部分选择一个领域和一个专长，要么从{@book NPC Realms|KaW|2|NPC Realms}部分选择一个领域。这个选择并不意味着NPC领域有一个特定的角色，可能对角色的组织友好也可能对抗，这取决于GM的决定。",
	"The GM picks the NPC realm's starting attitude toward the characters' organization, using the table under {@book Diplomacy|KaW|2|Diplomacy} in {@b Domain Skills} (page 20). This attitude should be based on the NPC realm's history not just with the characters, but also with domains similar to the characters' organization.": "GM根据{@b Domain Skills}（第20页）中{@book Diplomacy|KaW|2|Diplomacy}下的表格选择NPC领域对角色组织的起始态度。这种态度应该基于NPC领域与角色不仅仅是历史上的关系，还有与类似于角色组织的领域的关系。",
	"The GM names the NPC realm's leader. This NPC doesn't necessarily need a stat block, but it helps to note a few details about their appearance and personality.": "GM命名NPC领袖。这个NPC不一定需要有属性块，但注明一些关于他们外貌和个性的细节会有所帮助。",
	"The GM chooses the NPC realm's domain size (which need not bear any relationship to the size of the characters' organization), and picks a stronghold the NPC realm controls.": "GM选择NPC领域的领地大小（不必与角色组织的大小有任何关系），并选择NPC领域控制的要塞。",
	"The GM can freely swap out the special unit the NPC realm can normally muster with a special unit from another domain. Perhaps a fey court of elves in the campaign has a roguish flair and is able to bring together the Crew (normally associated with an underworld syndicate domain) instead of the Court Jesters.": "GM可以自由地用另一个领域的特殊单位替换NPC领域通常能够召集的特殊单位。也许在冒险中，一群精灵的精灵法庭有着一种流氓的风格，能够召集来自地下犯罪集团领域的船员，而不是法庭小丑。",
	"For example, consider a GM who wants to create a domain of secluded stone giants living in the mountains near the characters' stronghold. The GM begins with the giant jarldom NPC realm and gives the isolationist giants a suspicious attitude toward the characters. Smallfolk warred with the giants centuries ago, and while the humanoids might have forgotten that past, the stone remembers. The stone giants are led by Jarl Klanga. She's young and defensive minded, after her parents died in the same landslide that resulted in her losing an arm. The GM decides the realm doesn't hold much influence given their isolationist nature, and gives it a size of 1. The domain has a stronghold: a mountain fortress called Citadel Adamantine.": "例如，考虑一个想要创建一个居住在角色据点附近山脉中的隐居石巨人领地的GM。GM从巨人领主NPC领地开始，让这些隐士巨人对角色持怀疑态度。小人类与巨人们在几个世纪前发生过战争，虽然人类可能已经忘记了那段过去，但石头却记得。石巨人由贾尔·克兰加（Jarl Klanga）领导。她年轻且防御性强，因为她的父母在同一场山崩中丧生，导致她失去了一只手臂。GM决定这个领地由于其隐士性质而没有太大的影响力，并将其规模设定为1。这个领地有一个据点：一座名为堡垒亚当汀（Citadel Adamantine）的山堡。",
	"In a campaign in which the GM enjoys letting the players join in on the fun of setting creation, it can be cool to let each of the players design an NPC realm for the GM to use. The GM can assign each of the players a domain size and an attitude that their NPC realm has toward the characters' organization, then let them determine the rest of the details. The players get in on the fun of building the easiest type of domain, and the GM has to do less work. Win-win!": "在一场GM喜欢让玩家参与创作的活动中，让每位玩家设计一个NPC领域供GM使用会很有趣。GM可以为每位玩家分配一个领域大小和NPC领域对角色组织的态度，然后让他们决定其余的细节。玩家们参与到建立最简单类型的领域的乐趣中，而GM则需要做更少的工作。双赢！",
	"GMs might find that their worlds include a villainous or NPC domain that's not an automatic fit for any of the concepts this book provides. For example, consider a campaign that features a powerful faction of gnolls. Even though there's no NPC realm set up as a gnoll war band, there's almost certainly another domain that fits. If the gnolls are proud warriors, the GM can use the orc clan domain and call it something else. If the gnolls are religious zealots, their domain could be built as a hidden cult religious order. Or for gnolls with a culture of invention and innovation, the gnomish kingdom might be a perfect fit!": "GM们可能会发现，他们的世界中包括一个邪恶的NPC领地，这个领地不完全符合本书提供的任何概念。例如，考虑一个以强大的豺狼人派系为特色的冒险。尽管没有专门设定豺狼人战队的NPC领地，几乎肯定有另一个领地适合。如果豺狼人是自豪的战士，GM可以使用兽人部落领地，并给它取一个不同的名字。如果豺狼人是宗教狂热者，他们的领地可以建立为一个隐藏的宗教秘密组织。或者对于有着发明和创新文化的豺狼人来说，侏儒王国可能是一个完美的选择！",
	"Likewise, GMs shouldn't feel locked into building NPC realms based on ancestry. The goblinoid realm in a campaign doesn't have to be a goblinoid coalition domain. The GM can make it an arcane order, a despotic regime, an undersea colony, or whatever makes sense for their world.": "同样，GM不应感到被锁定在基于血统构建NPC领域的范围内。在一个冒险中，地精领域不一定要是地精联盟领地。GM可以将其设定为一个奥术秩序、专制政权、水下殖民地，或者任何对他们的世界有意义的设定。",
	"When a group of characters founds a domain, the players choose one of the eight organization types described in this section. Each organization features three specializations that the players also choose from, creating a wide range of possibilities for the heroes' domain.": "当一组角色建立领地时，玩家可以从本节中描述的八种组织类型中选择一种。每种组织都有三种特殊化选项，玩家也需要从中选择，为英雄的领地创造出各种可能性。",
	"Though this section is primarily for player characters, and is written to speak to the players, a GM can also use the domains presented in this section to create enemy and NPC realms.": "尽管这一部分主要是为玩家角色而写的，并且是与玩家交流的，GM也可以利用本节中呈现的领域来创建敌人和NPC的领域。",
	"If a character gains a proficiency from a domain title that they already gain from another source, that character can take another proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.": "如果一个角色从领域称号中获得了一个已经从其他来源获得的熟练加点，那个角色可以选择获得另一种相同类型（技能或工具）的熟练加点。(domain title)。",
	"Mercenaries. Troubleshooters. Rag-tag heroes trying to get by—except \"heroes\" might not be quite the right word.

It just might be a bit...messy.": "雇佣兵。解决者。一群勉强维持生计的散兵游勇——除了\"英雄\"可能并不是很贴切的词。你的角色们已经结成了一个冒险队伍，一个由各种各样的个体组成的杂乱团队，一起在王国中旅行，拥有共同的目标。虽然你们可能不是最外交或高贵的团体，但在关键时刻你们能完成任务。只是可能会有点...混乱。",

	"Most orc clans are composed of numerous smaller tribes and extended families, creating a bond that sees clan members defend their fellows with ruthless tactics and little patience for insult.

	"Many of those who lose a campaign against an orc clan tell tales of the orcs' brutality, but this paints a picture that is far from accurate.

	"When great heroes like Ajax, Hector, or Achilles participate in a war, the story is about them fighting other heroes. Enemy heroes. The Trojan War is just a backdrop for these individuals' epic stories.

You can just play out normal encounters while a huge battle is described happening around the heroes and their enemies, like some particularly dramatic background music.": "当像阿贾克斯（Ajax）、赫克托尔（Hector）或阿喀琉斯（Achilles）这样的伟大英雄参与战争时，故事就是关于他们与其他英雄作战。敌对的英雄。特洛伊战争只是这些个人史诗故事的背景。因此，如果您想讲述这样的故事——伟大的军队在背景中激烈对抗，而英雄和反派在单挑中互相对抗——那么您就不需要战争规则。您可以在巨大的战斗描绘中，描述英雄和他们的敌人周围发生的正常遭遇，就像一些特别戏剧性的背景音乐。",
	"This system, by contrast, assumes that even in a fantasy world, armies are important. Heroes can fight other heroes, but it takes an army to capture and hold territory—and to defend a domain against a villain's army. Each army's tactics, the units deployed, and who won is important—as is how they won. So while the characters still need to stop the villain in a thrilling combat, the characters' army also needs to defeat the villain's army to fully secure victory.": "相比之下，这个系统假设即使在一个幻想世界中，军队也是重要的。英雄可以与其他英雄战斗，但需要一支军队来占领和控制领土，并且抵御反派军队的进攻。每支军队的战术、部署的单位以及谁取得了胜利都很重要，以及他们是如何取得胜利的。因此，虽然角色们仍然需要在激动人心的战斗中阻止反派，但角色们的军队也需要击败反派的军队才能彻底获得胜利。",
	"These rules don't worry overmuch about where the player characters are during a battle, or exactly what they're doing. Most are probably off adventuring or fighting the leaders of the villain's army. They're not on the battlefield trying to micromanage their own army. But that army is still an extension of the characters. Each unit gains benefits in battle based on a player character's class (see {@book Martial Advantages|KaW|3|Martial Advantages} on page 111), but a character's features, traits, spells, and feats mostly help make them better at fighting monsters. Characters aren't designed to fight armies. So these rules let the characters focus on fighting monsters and villains while their army tries to take and hold the villain's territory, or to stop the villain's army from taking territory of its own.": "这些规则并不过分担心玩家角色在战斗中的位置，或者他们正在做什么。大多数可能正在冒险或与反派军队的领导作战。他们不会在战场上试图微观管理自己的军队。但是这支军队仍然是角色的延伸。每个单位在战斗中根据玩家角色的职业获得好处（见第{@book Martial Advantages|KaW|3|Martial Advantages}页），但角色的特征、特性、法术和技能大多帮助他们更擅长与怪物战斗。角色并非设计用来对抗军队。因此，这些规则让角色专注于与怪物和反派作战，而他们的军队则试图夺取和控制反派的领土，或者阻止反派军队夺取自己的领土。",
	"Players and GMs who like these rules and want to use this system in their games should make sure that everyone understands wars are about armies.

	"Giving the villain of the adventure an army to attack the heroes' domain, the domains of their allies, or even just the place they live is a great way to get the players engaged with warfare. A GM can pause and say \"Meanwhile...\" as they describe a scenario in which the heroes' domain is threatened and the players must use the heroes' army to defend it.": "给冒险故事的反派提供一支军队来攻击英雄们的领地、他们盟友的领地，甚至只是他们居住的地方，这是让玩家们参与战争的绝佳方式。GM可以暂停并说“同时...”，描述一个情景，英雄的领地受到威胁，玩家们必须动用英雄的军队来保卫它。",
	"One of the most canonical uses of warfare is to give the players more—and more interesting—things to do during downtime, or at any time between group adventures when the characters are free to be more self-directed. In the time between one adventure and another, the players have a chance to come up with their own goals and motivations. And having characters be officers in a domain with a standing army, even a small one, opens up all sorts of new opportunities for story and game play.": "战争的一个最经典的用途是在角色闲暇时间或者在团队冒险之间的任何时候，为玩家提供更多——更有趣的事情去做，当角色有更多自主权时。在一个冒险和另一个之间的时间里，玩家有机会制定自己的目标和动机。让角色成为一个拥有常备军队的领地的军官，即使是一个小小的领地，也为故事和游戏玩法提供了各种新机会。",
	"The players might decide to use the characters' army proactively. Send it somewhere to liberate a town or temple, or to clear out a forest infested with cultists. Send it to blockade a road and force a confrontation with a local warlord. Or they might use it reactively based on challenges the GM places in front of them, like a rebellion or an uprising. Between adventures, unlimited possibilities for drama and action arise, and warfare can easily factor into these.": "玩家们可能决定积极利用角色的军队。将其派往某处解放一个城镇或寺庙，或清除被异教徒侵扰的森林。将其派往封锁道路，迫使与当地军阀对抗。或者他们可能根据GM摆在面前的挑战，如叛乱或起义，来做出反应。在冒险之间，无限的戏剧和行动可能性涌现，战争可以很容易地成为其中的一个因素。",
	"The most spectacular use of this system is to simulate a climactic confrontation between a heroic organization and a villainous realm. The easiest and most fun way to do this is to run and resolve the battle first, then the combat, even though both are actually happening simultaneously. This works much the same way that players in combat resolve their characters' actions in distinct turns, even though in reality the characters are all moving and attacking at the same time.": "这个系统最壮观的用途是模拟一个英雄组织和一个邪恶领域之间的高潮对抗。最简单、最有趣的方法是先进行并解决战斗，然后再进行战斗，尽管实际上两者是同时发生的。这与玩家在战斗中解决他们角色的行动的方式非常相似，尽管实际上角色都在同时移动和攻击。",
	"When this is done, mark down who wins the battle and on which turn. Then, on that turn of the combat, the winning officers each gain a Morale Surge they can use at any time (see the sidebar). The warfare rules have been designed to, on a whole, resolve faster than character combat. This is not wholly realistic, but it is dramatic—and it allows the game to continue to focus on the heroes and their actions. Their army will win or lose before the end of the combat, and the victors gain a sudden and dramatic bonus reflecting the rush of adrenaline.": "当战斗结束时，记录谁赢得了战斗，以及在第几回合。然后，在战斗的那一回合，获胜的军官们每人获得一次士气激增，他们可以随时使用（见边栏）。 战争规则的设计旨在整体上比角色战斗更快地解决。 这并不完全现实，但是它很戏剧化—它使游戏能够继续专注于英雄及其行动。 他们的军队将在战斗结束前获胜或失败，而胜利者会获得突如其来的戏剧性奖励，反映出肾上腺素的激增。",
	"Of course, this requires some willing suspension of disbelief, since the players will have already resolved the battle before starting the combat. So they know who's going to win—and on what turn— going into their own final fight. But even if this causes characters to change their behavior in what is technically a metagaming sense, it can easily be explained as the characters being the ones who trained the forces fighting outside—and as such, being instinctively aware that those forces are going to win (or lose!), even if that wasn't strictly obvious during the actual running of the battle.": "当然，这需要一些愿意暂时搁置怀疑，因为玩家们在开始战斗前已经解决了战斗。所以他们知道谁会赢，以及在哪个回合会赢，进入他们自己的最后一场战斗。但即使这会导致角色在技术上的元游戏意义上改变他们的行为，这也可以轻松解释为角色是那些在外面战斗的部队的训练者，因此，他们本能地意识到那些部队会赢（或输！），即使在实际进行战斗时这并不明显。",
	"A battle can, of course, take longer than a combat! This isn't a problem if the winner of the battle is the same domain as the winner of the combat. But even if that's not the case, when a domain's commanders lose a combat (whether they died, surrendered, were banished to another dimension, and so on) their troops automatically undertake the Retreat maneuver. (The rest of this chapter explains maneuvers and all the other rules for warfare.)": "一场战斗当然可能比一次战斗时间更长！如果战斗的胜利者与战斗的胜利者属于相同的领域，这并不是问题。但即使不是这种情况，当一个领域的指挥官们输掉一场战斗（无论是死亡、投降、被放逐到另一个维度等），他们的部队会自动执行撤退（Retreat）动作。（本章的其余部分解释了各种动作和战争的其他规则。）",
	"A character experiences a sudden rush of adrenaline upon hearing the herald's news of victory on the field of battle. As a bonus action, the character can move half their speed and take one additional action, on top of their regular action and movement. The character can use this benefit once, and loses it if they don't use it before taking a long rest.": "一个角色在听到传令官在战场上的胜利消息后突然感到肾上腺素飙升。作为一个奖励动作，角色可以移动他们速度的一半并额外进行一次行动，除了他们的常规行动和移动。角色可以使用这个好处一次，在长休之前如果不使用就会失去。",
	"When the GM decides that it's time for a battle to begin, each side can attempt to bring the siege. This section of the rules vaguely emulates the behavior of European military conflicts from the eleventh century to the fifteenth century. During these times, the majority of battles were sieges—one army attacking a fortification, rather than two armies facing each other in the field. The major question of the time was: Which side would mobilize first and lay siege to the other side's castle or keep?": "当(`GM(游戏主持人)`)决定是时候开始一场战斗时，双方都可以尝试发动(`bring the siege`)围攻。规则的这一部分模糊地模拟了从11世纪到15世纪欧洲军事冲突的行为。在那个时代，大多数战斗都是围攻——一支军队攻击一座要塞，而不是两支军队在野外对峙。当时的主要问题是：哪一方会首先动员并围攻对方的城堡或要塞？",
	"The warfare rules simulate this historical setup by requiring both domains to make an opposed Operations test at the start of each battle. The winner decides whether they will attack the villain's stronghold, defend their own stronghold, or meet on a different field of battle. In the case of a tie (or if the GM determines that it's not appropriate for a particular battle to involve a stronghold), both armies meet at a location away from either stronghold.": "战争规则通过要求双方领地在每场战斗开始时进行对抗性的行动测试来模拟这种历史设置。胜者决定他们是攻击恶棍的据点、保卫自己的据点，还是在另一个战场相遇。如果出现平局（或者GM确定某场战斗不适合涉及据点），那么双方军队将在远离任何据点的地点相遇。",
	"The army that defends its domain's stronghold gains the benefits of the fortifications of that stronghold. The army that attacks has more flexibility in its tactics and is said to have seized the initiative. All units in that army's vanguard rank get a free activation at the start of the battle. While the attacking army is taking this free activation, the units of the defending army can use reactions only.": "保卫领地要塞的军队将获得该要塞的防御工事所带来的好处。进攻的军队在战术上更加灵活，据说占据了主动权。该军队先锋排的所有单位在战斗开始时获得一次免费激活。在进攻军队进行这次免费激活时，防守军队的单位只能使用反应。",
	"One of the keys to keeping battles fun is making sure everyone has room to maneuver. Each side in the battle has a 4 × 5 grid—twenty spaces in total— on which to place their infantry and artillery units. Cavalry and aerial units do not use the grid.": "保持战斗有趣的关键之一是确保每个人都有足够的空间进行机动。 战斗中的每一方都有一个 4 × 5 网格—总共二十个空间—用于放置他们的步兵和炮兵单位。 骑兵和空中单位不使用该网格。",
	"If one side of the battlefield is completely filled with troops, that side is left with no room to maneuver and the game turns into a slog. As such, these rules work best with each side controlling twelve or fewer units.": "如果战场的一侧被部队完全填满，那一侧就没有机动的空间，游戏就会变得艰难。因此，这些规则最适合每一方控制十二个或更少单位。",
	"Throughout these rules, you'll see references to units making tests. Just like with the rules for running domains, tests in warfare are analogous to your character making ability checks—you roll a d20, add a modifier, and compare the total to a fixed DC or some other value. If the result is equal to or greater than the value it's compared to, the test succeeds. Tests can likewise be made with advantage and disadvantage, just like ability checks.": "在这些规则中，你会看到有关单位进行测试的参考。就像在领地运营规则中一样，战争中的测试类似于你的角色进行能力检定——你投掷一个d20，加上一个修正值，然后将总数与固定的DC或其他数值进行比较。如果结果等于或大于与之比较的数值，测试就成功了。测试也可以像能力检定一样以优势和劣势进行。",
	"When a unit attacks another unit, it first makes an Attack test opposed by the opposed unit's Defense. To successfully execute a special maneuver, a unit must succeed on a Command test with a DC based on the complexity of the maneuver. (Attack, Defense, and Command are three of the modifiers that are part of every unit's battle statistics, discussed in more detail below.)": "当一个单位攻击另一个单位时，它首先进行一次攻击测试，对抗被攻击单位的防御。要成功执行特殊动作，一个单位必须通过一个指令测试，DC 基于动作的复杂程度。 （攻击，防御和指令是每个单位战斗统计数据中的三个修正项，稍后将更详细讨论。）",
	"The best way to test out these rules is to start with a small battle, wherein each player controls just one unit. There are then a commensurate number of units on the opposing side, controlled by the GM. A battle of this size—perhaps two opposing forces trying to take over a small town—gives everyone, including the GM, the chance to learn the system and get their feet wet.": "测试这些规则的最佳方式是从一场小战斗开始，每个玩家只控制一个单位。然后，由GM控制对立面的相应数量的单位。这种规模的战斗——也许是两支对立的部队试图占领一个小镇——让每个人，包括GM，有机会了解系统并入门。",
	"It might seem like a fun idea to start with a huge battle! An epic confrontation with dozens of units on each side! But this system will quickly bog down under that kind of setup, and there are better ways to create this epic feel. These rules don't model individual soldiers, which means that players and GMs are free to redefine the scale of battle to suit their needs. If you want to run an epic battle, simply say that each unit represents a legion of five thousand soldiers rather than a squad of fifty or some other smaller number.": "开始时可能会觉得从一个大规模战斗开始是个有趣的主意！每边都有数十个单位的史诗对抗！但这种系统很快就会在那种设置下变得混乱不堪，有更好的方法来营造这种史诗感。这些规则不模拟个别士兵，这意味着玩家和GM可以自由重新定义战斗的规模以满足他们的需求。如果你想进行一场史诗般的战斗，只需说每个单位代表五千名士兵的军团，而不是五十人的小队或其他较小的数字。",
	"Alternatively, many of what are considered huge historical battles were actually a series of smaller related skirmishes. So if you want to replicate this kind of massive battle, you can use this system to play out specific skirmishes within a larger war. Using different battlefield setups each time, you'll play out the battle for the port, then the battle for the tower gates, and finally the battle for the city, with the results of each battle affecting the next.": "相反地，许多被认为是巨大历史战役的实际上是一系列相关的小规模冲突。因此，如果你想复制这种大规模战斗，你可以使用这个系统来玩出更大战争中的具体冲突。每次使用不同的战场设置，你将会玩出港口的战斗，然后是塔门的战斗，最后是城市的战斗，每场战斗的结果都会影响下一场。",
	"In the warfare rules, \"allied units\" refers to all units that are part of an army or are friendly to that army. \"Opposed units\" refers to all units that are part of the army fielded by the other side in a battle, or which are friendly to that other side's army. The same usage applies when talking about opposed commanders. This allows the rules to read properly from the perspective both of players running their characters' army and the GM running a villain's army, by avoiding terms like \"enemy\" that might be misread as referring only to the units of the villain or GM's side.": "在战争规则中，“联盟单位”指的是所有属于一个军队或对该军队友好的单位。“对立单位”指的是在战斗中对立方军队中的所有单位，或者对该对立方军队友好的单位。在谈论对立指挥官时也适用相同的用法。这样可以使规则从玩家运行其角色军队和GM运行反派军队的角度正确阅读，避免使用诸如“敌人”之类的术语，这可能会被误解为仅指反派或GM一方的单位。",
	"If any part of the rules allows a unit to affect allied units, the unit can also affect itself (assuming it meets all other criteria for the specific effect).": "如果规则的任何部分允许一个单位影响友方单位，那么该单位也可以影响自己（假设它满足特定效果的所有其他条件）。（assuming it meets all other criteria for the specific effect）",
	"Each player character involved in a warfare battle can command a number of units equal to their proficiency bonus, which means players can eventually control up to six units each! If your group has five or six players, that can mean battles with thirty units or more on a side!": "每个参与战争战斗的玩家角色可以指挥数量等于他们熟练加值的单位，这意味着玩家最终可以控制多达六个单位！如果你的小组有五到六名玩家，这意味着每边可能有三十个以上的单位参与战斗！",
	"Any time you play a battle with more than fifteen units on a side, it's recommended that the battlefield be expanded by adding ranks (rows) and files (columns) to the field, so that there are always openings and empty spaces. As a general rule of thumb, add one new column for every three units beyond fifteen. Once you've added two columns, add another row: a second vanguard row with the same rules for deployment as the original vanguard row.": "每当你进行一场超过十五个单位的战斗时，建议通过增加行（rank）和列（file）来扩展战场，以便始终保持开放和空旷的空间。一般的经验法则是，每超过十五个单位就添加一列。一旦添加了两列，再添加一行：第二个先锋行，部署规则与原始先锋行相同。",
	"15 or fewer": "15或更少",
	"Nothing; use the 4 × 5 grid for each side": "每边使用 4 × 5 网格。",
	"One column": "一栏 (%(One column)%)",
	"Another column": "另一列 (Another column)",

	"Not all domains need an army. Depending on the campaign or the nature of the specific adventure you're playing, domains for the characters and the villains are still useful for the additional features they grant, even without these warfare rules. A heroic organization might act behind the scenes, or lend aid to other domains in the form of special units that can be mustered and sent to help allies. But if an enemy has an army marching on the characters' stronghold—or vice versa—creating an army is the best way to play out that scenario!": "并非所有领域都需要一支军队。根据你所进行的战役或特定冒险的性质，角色和反派的领域仍然对于它们提供的额外功能是有用的，即使没有这些战争规则。一个英雄组织可能在幕后行动，或者以特殊单位的形式向其他领域提供援助，这些单位可以被动员并派遣去帮助盟友。但如果敌人派出军队进攻角色的据点，或者反之，创建一支军队是玩出这种情景的最佳方式！",

	"An army defends a domain and fights battles for the domain's officers (either the player characters or the villains controlled by the GM). While the characters confront an opposed domain's leaders in an epic combat, the armies loyal to both sides clash in an epic battle. The characters and the villains issue orders, but the soldiers who fight and die in response to those orders are the ones who take and hold the field—the ones who win or lose the war.": "一支军队保卫领土，并为领土的官员（无论是玩家角色还是由GM控制的反派）进行战斗。当角色们在一场史诗般的战斗中对抗另一领土的领导者时，双方忠于各自的军队在一场史诗般的战斗中相互冲突。角色和反派发出命令，但是那些根据这些命令战斗并牺牲的士兵才是占领并保持战场的人——是赢家还是输家。",
	"The following is a typical unit, so let's check out its stats.": "以下是一个典型单位，让我们来查看它的属性。",
	"There are a lot of numbers and symbols at use here, but you'll quickly get used to them. And you'll find much more information on all these stats and how they're used in the sections that follow.": "这里使用了很多数字和符号，但你很快就会习惯它们。在接下来的章节中，你会找到更多关于所有这些统计数据以及它们如何使用的信息。",
	"Every unit has a name. For normal units, that name is just a combination of the unit's ancestry and type—for example, Human Cavalry, Elf Artillery, or Hobgoblin Infantry. Some units have more descriptive names, though, such as Human Shield Maniple or Bugbear Heavy Claw. Special units might follow either format. And unique units have quotation marks around their names, to indicate that there is only one of these special units anywhere in the world.": "每个单位都有一个名称。对于普通单位，该名称只是单位的血统和类型的组合，例如人类骑兵，精灵炮兵或地精步兵。但有些单位有更具描述性的名称，比如人类护盾编队或兽人重型爪兵。特殊单位可能遵循任一格式。而独特单位的名称周围有引号，表示世界上只有一个这样的特殊单位。",
	"Every unit also has a commander. This is the creature that issues orders to the unit in battle—usually one of the officers in charge of the domain fielding the unit.": "每个单位也有一个指挥官。这是在战斗中向单位发布命令的生物，通常是负责派遣该单位的领地中的军官之一。",
	"The rules don't worry too much about how exactly a human paladin locked in combat with an evil enemy cleric is able to make their intentions known to the unit they command out on the battlefield. The system is deliberately abstract. Runners and heralds are tasked with conveying such orders, and minor magics can facilitate communication between a commander and their troops. But beyond that, a unit knows what its commander wants because the commander has trained that unit. As well, each unit is assumed to have sergeants and subcommanders who know what to do if the commander is incapacitated, killed, or turned into a slimy toad.": "规则并不太担心一个人类圣武士与邪恶敌对教士在战场上交战时如何向他们指挥的部队表达自己的意图。这个系统是故意抽象的。传令兵和使者被委托传达这样的命令，一些小魔法可以促进指挥官和部队之间的沟通。但除此之外，一个部队知道他们的指挥官想要什么，是因为指挥官已经训练过这个部队。此外，每个部队都假定有军士长和副指挥官，他们知道如果指挥官被伤残、杀死或变成一只黏糊糊的蟾蜍时该怎么做。",
	"{@b Attack (ATK)} is a measure of a unit's tactical effectiveness—its ability to successfully execute an attack order and engage an opposed unit. A successful Attack test can inflict casualties on an opposed unit, but is only half of the process of making an attack. Attack is opposed by Defense and improved by experience.": "{@b Attack (ATK)}是一个单位战术效能的衡量标准——它成功执行攻击命令并与对抗单位交战的能力。成功的攻击测试可以对对抗单位造成伤亡，但这只是进行攻击过程的一半。攻击受到防御的对抗，并且经验可以提高攻击效果。",
	"{@b Defense (DEF)} is a measure of a unit's ability to maneuver in such a way that it can avoid an opposed unit's attack, or minimize it so much that it fails to make a noticeable dent in the unit's casualties. Defense is improved by experience.": "{@b Defense (DEF)}是一个单位在战斗中躲避对方单位攻击的能力，或者减少攻击的程度，以至于对单位的伤亡没有明显影响的度量单位。防御能力会随着经验的增加而提高。",
	"{@b Power (POW)} is a measure of a unit's physical prowess in battle. When the halberds strike, the arrows fall, or the lances pierce, how much force is behind them? Making a Power test is the second part of making an attack, and inflicts even more casualties on an opposed unit. Power tests made for other reasons do not deal damage unless the rules say so. Power is opposed by Toughness and improved by equipment.": "{@b Power (POW)}是衡量单位在战斗中身体力量的一个指标。当戟刃挥舞、箭矢飞射或长矛刺击时，背后到底有多少力量？进行力量测试是发动攻击的第二步，对敌方单位造成更多伤亡。除非规则另有规定，否则出于其他原因进行的力量测试不会造成伤害。力量受到韧性的抵抗，而装备可以提升力量。",
	"{@b Toughness (TOU)} is a measure of a unit's physical hardiness—its ability to withstand successful attacks and keep fighting. Toughness is improved by equipment.": "{@b Toughness (TOU)}是一个单位物理耐力的衡量标准—它的抵抗成功攻击并继续战斗的能力。坚韧度可以通过装备来提高。",
	"{@b Morale (MOR)} measures a unit's ability to maintain discipline in the face of overwhelming odds, powerful magic, exotic enemies, and death. Failing a Morale test inflicts casualties just as Attack tests and Power tests can, since a soldier who is terrified and flees is just as ineffective as a dead soldier. Morale is improved by experience.": "{@b Morale (MOR)} 衡量了一个单位在面对压倒性的困境、强大的魔法、异国敌人和死亡时保持纪律的能力。未通过士气测试会造成伤亡，就像攻击测试和力量测试一样，因为一个恐惧而逃跑的士兵和一个死去的士兵一样无效。士气通过经验来提高。",
	"{@b Command (COM)} is a unit's ability to correctly interpret complex orders and execute them successfully. Command is improved by experience.": "{@b Command (COM)} 是一个单位正确解释复杂命令并成功执行的能力。指挥能力会随着经验的增加而提高。",
	"{@b Number of attacks (the sword icon)} represents the number of times a unit can organize itself to attack other units in one round of battle. Most units have only one attack. Number of attacks is improved by experience.": "{@b Number of attacks (the sword icon)}代表单位在一轮战斗中可以组织自己攻击其他单位的次数。大多数单位只有一次攻击。攻击次数会随着经验的提升而增加。",
	"{@b Damage (DMG)} is the number of casualties inflicted on a successful Power test made after a successful Attack test. If some part of the rules grants a bonus to damage, that bonus applies only to the Power test made as part of an attack. Damage is improved by equipment.": "{@b Damage (DMG)}是在成功的攻击检定后造成的伤亡人数。如果规则的某些部分为伤害提供了奖励，那个奖励只适用于作为攻击一部分的力量检定。装备可以提高伤害。",
	"{@b Size} is an abstract measure of a unit's ability to maintain morale and unit cohesion, and to carry out orders. Size determines a unit's {@b casualty die} (see below), and so determines how much damage a unit can take. The bigger a unit's size, the more effective it is at staying in the fight.": "{@b Size}是一个抽象的度量单位维持士气和单位凝聚力，执行命令的能力。规模决定了单位的{@b casualty die}（见下文），从而决定了单位可以承受多少伤害。单位规模越大，单位在战斗中保持有效性的能力就越强。",
	"{@b Movement} is another of a unit's battle statistics, but does not appear on the card because all units have a movement of 1.": "{@b Movement}是单位的另一个战斗统计数据，但因为所有单位的移动力都是1，所以不会显示在卡片上。",
	"During warfare, the number of casualties a unit can suffer but still keep on fighting is represented by the {@b casualty die}. A casualty die is based on a unit's size, and is placed on the unit card during battle with the number of casualties the unit has remaining facing up. For example, a size 6 unit would begin with a d6 casualty die, with the 6 facing up.": "在战争中，一个单位可以承受的伤亡人数，但仍然能继续战斗的数量由{@b casualty die}来表示。伤亡骰基于单位的规模，并在战斗中放置在单位卡上，显示单位剩余的伤亡人数。例如，一个规模为6的单位将从一个d6伤亡骰开始，6朝上。",
	"If a unit is ever reduced to half its maximum casualties or fewer, it is {@b diminished}. The first time a unit is diminished in a battle, it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Morale test or immediately suffer 1 casualty.": "如果一个单位的伤亡数量降至其最大伤亡数量的一半或更少，它就是{@b diminished}。在一场战斗中，当一个单位第一次减少时，它必须通过一个{@dc 13}士气测试，否则立即遭受1点伤亡。",
	"If a unit's casualty die ever reaches 0, the unit is {@b broken} and is removed from the battle. A broken unit might be able to be rallied to return to the battle, or it might be disbanded and permanently lost.": "如果一个单位的伤亡骰子达到了0，该单位就是{@b broken}并且从战斗中移除。一个破碎的单位可能会被集结起来重新回到战场，或者可能会被解散并永久丢失。",
	"These rules don't worry about the exact number of soldiers or monsters in a unit. Likewise, casualties usually mean soldiers killed by enemy action, but not always. A soldier who is disoriented or too terrified to act, or who cannot see or hear or understand their commanders' orders, is just as ineffective as a dead soldier. For this reason, even though a unit might be removed from the battlefield when broken, there is a chance that it can be rallied later by gathering together scattered soldiers, bolstering their resolve, and organizing them for battle again.": "这些规则不必担心单位中士兵或怪物的确切数量。同样，伤亡通常指的是被敌人行动杀死的士兵，但并非总是如此。一个感到迷惑或过于恐惧而无法行动，或者无法看到、听到或理解指挥官命令的士兵，和一个死去的士兵一样无效。因此，即使一个单位在破裂时可能被从战场上撤离，仍然有可能通过聚集散落的士兵、增强他们的决心并组织他们再次投入战斗来重新集结。",
	"A unit's type is represented by a weapon symbol. Type determines what a unit can do in battle, who it can attack, and who it can be attacked by. There are four types of basic unit: infantry, artillery (including siege weapons), cavalry, and aerial. For the purpose of improving experience and equipment (see below), cavalry and aerial units use the same tables.": "一个单位的类型由武器符号表示。类型决定了一个单位在战斗中能做什么，可以攻击谁，以及可以被谁攻击。基本单位有四种类型：步兵，炮兵（包括攻城武器），骑兵和空军。为了提高经验和装备（见下文），骑兵和空军单位使用相同的表格。",

	"Experience is a combination of how much training a unit has and how much fighting it's seen. More experienced units gain bonuses to Attack, Defense, Morale, and Command, as well as additional attacks, as indicated on the Unit Experience Bonuses table. But different types of units learn different lessons in battle.": "经验是一个单位接受过的训练量和参与战斗的次数的结合。更有经验的单位在攻击、防御、士气和指挥方面会获得奖励，以及额外的攻击，如《单位经验奖励表》所示。但不同类型的单位在战斗中学到的教训也不同。",
	"Units gain experience by surviving battles, according to how experienced they already are (see {@book Improving Units|KaW|3|Improving Units} on page 104). Each section of the table starts with the lowest level of experience at the top, with each subsequent level below indicating the next improvement.": "单位通过在战斗中存活获得经验，根据它们已有的经验水平（见第{@book Improving Units|KaW|3|Improving Units}页）。表格的每个部分从顶部开始是最低级别的经验，下面的每个后续级别表示下一个提升。",
	"The bonuses on these tables are {@b not cumulative}. If a veteran infantry unit survives a battle and improves to become elite, its Attack modifier goes up by 1, not by 2.": "这些表格上的奖励是{@b not cumulative}。如果一支老兵步兵部队在战斗中幸存下来并晋升为精英，其攻击修正值只增加1，而不是2。",
	"The number of stars in a unit card's upper left corner indicate the unit's level of experience. Levies and regular units have no stars, veteran units have one star, elite units have two stars, and super-elite units have three stars.": "单位卡片左上角的星星数量表示单位的经验等级。征兵和普通单位没有星星，老兵单位有一颗星，精英单位有两颗星，超级精英单位有三颗星。",
	"Levies are infantry troops who have zero training and no experience, typically laborers and townsfolk. They know their likely fate in battle, but they believe enough in a domain's cause to fight and die for it—or they fear the price of not fighting even more.": "征兵是没有接受过训练和经验的步兵部队，通常是劳工和城镇居民。他们知道自己在战斗中的命运，但他们对领地的事业有足够的信仰，愿意为之战斗和牺牲，或者更害怕不战斗所带来的代价。",
	"Levies cannot have their gear or experience improved. They automatically disband after every battle and must be mustered again for the next battle.": "征收部队无法改进其装备或经验。他们在每次战斗后自动解散，必须再次集结以参加下一场战斗。",
	"Equipment describes a unit's arms and armor. Heavier units have better weapons and armor, granting them bonuses to Power, Toughness, and Damage (except for artillery units), but they might not be as flexible in battle as a lighter, more mobile unit. As with experience, different types of units gain different benefits from improving their equipment.": "装备描述了一个单位的武器和盔甲。更重的单位拥有更好的武器和盔甲，为它们提供力量、坚韧和伤害的加成（炮兵单位除外），但它们在战斗中可能没有轻型、更机动的单位灵活。与经验一样，不同类型的单位从改进装备中获得不同的好处。",
	"Units improve their equipment by having their domain pay for those improvements (see {@book Improving Units|KaW|3|Improving Units} on page 104). Each section of the Unit Equipment Bonuses table starts with the baseline level of equipment at the top, with each subsequent level below indicating the next improvement.": "单位通过让其领地支付这些改进来改善他们的装备（见第{@book Improving Units|KaW|3|Improving Units}页）。单位装备奖励表的每个部分从顶部的基准装备水平开始，下面的每个后续水平表示下一个改进。",

	"The bonuses a unit gains because of its ancestry have very little to do with any of the stats that creatures of those ancestries have in the core rules. The warfare rules are concerned with how well creatures organize, take orders, and maintain morale and unit cohesion, none of which are necessarily related to how well creatures fight in single combat.": "单位因其血统而获得的奖励与核心规则中这些血统生物的任何属性几乎没有关系。 战争规则关注的是生物组织、接受命令、保持士气和单位凝聚力的程度，这些都不一定与生物在单挑战斗中的表现有关。",
	"A unit's tier, represented by a Roman numeral on its card, is a measure of the unit's overall power or nastiness. Tier I units are the least powerful (and thus the easiest to put onto the battlefield), while Tier V units are the most powerful.": "一个单位的等级，用卡片上的罗马数字表示，是衡量单位整体力量或恶意的标准。I级单位是最弱的（因此最容易放置在战场上），而V级单位是最强大的。",
	"All units after Tier I have unit dependencies that determine how many units of a specific tier are needed to field a unit of a higher tier. For example, you can field an unlimited number of Tier I units, but you must have more Tier I units than Tier II units.": "从一级单位开始，所有单位都有单位依赖关系，决定了需要多少特定等级的单位才能组建一个更高等级的单位。例如，你可以组建无限数量的一级单位，但你必须拥有比二级单位更多的一级单位。",
	"Each unit also has a collection of traits—maneuvers or special features that it can employ in battle. The names of each unit's traits are listed on its unit card, keying to the descriptions in the {@book Unit Traits|KaW|3|Unit Traits} section on page 126 in this chapter. This keeps the unit cards small and useful in battle, and means players don't have to constantly pick each card up to read what its traits can do in the middle of a battle.": "每个单位还有一系列特质——在战斗中可以使用的技能或特殊功能。每个单位特质的名称都列在其单位卡上，对应本章第126页中{@book Unit Traits|KaW|3|Unit Traits}部分的描述。这样设计可以使单位卡片简洁实用，在战斗中玩家不必不断地拿起每张卡片阅读其特质在战斗中的作用。",
	"As soon as a group of characters founds an organization, they muster four Tier I units of the players' choice from any ancestry the GM agrees the organization has access to. These are leaderless soldiers—probably regular light troops from other failed domains, looking for someone to serve.": "一旦一组角色建立了一个组织，他们可以从GM同意组织可以接触到的任何种族中选择四个I级单位。这些是没有领袖的士兵——可能是来自其他失败领地的普通轻步兵，正在寻找人来效忠。",
	"As an option, any time a domain musters a Tier I unit, it can muster two levies instead. This can boost the size of a starting army by making it some combination of levies and regular troops. However, levies automatically disband at the end of the next battle they fight in.": "作为一个选择，每当一个领地集结一个一级单位，它可以集结两支征兵代替。这可以通过使起始军队由征兵和正规部队的某种组合来增加规模。然而，征兵会在它们参加的下一场战斗结束时自动解散。",
	"Six ancestries are presented in this book—humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, goblinoids, and undead. Each ancestry features nine units covering different types and tiers. Whenever an organization musters new units, they must be from an ancestry the GM agrees the organization has access to, chosen from the nine units noted and following the rules for unit command and unit dependencies (detailed below).": "本书中介绍了六种祖先——人类，精灵，矮人，兽人，哥布林和不死族。每个祖先都包括九个单位，涵盖不同类型和层级。每当一个组织集结新单位时，这些单位必须来自GM同意组织可以访问的祖先中，从所指定的九个单位中选择，并遵循单位指挥和单位依赖的规则（详见下文）。",

	"Units mustered by a heroic organization belong to that organization. Each unit needs a commander (see {@b Unit Command and Dependencies} below) who must be an officer in the organization. These units gain experience through battle (unless they're levies), and the organization can spend gold to improve any unit's equipment.": "英雄组织召集的单位归属于该组织。每个单位都需要一名指挥官（见下文{@b Unit Command and Dependencies}），指挥官必须是该组织的军官。这些单位通过战斗获得经验（除非它们是征兵），组织可以花费金币来改善任何单位的装备。",
	"Gaining additional units can be accomplished in three ways:": "获得额外单位可以通过三种方式实现：",
	"An officer of the organization can use a domain action during intrigue to muster one unit from any ancestry the GM agrees the organization has access to (see the {@b Operations} section on page 23 in the {@b Domains & Intrigue} chapter).

They must conform to the rules for unit dependencies.": "组织的官员可以在阴谋中使用一个领域行动，从GM同意组织可以访问的任何血统中召集一个单位（请参见第23页{@b Operations}章节中的{@b Domains & Intrigue}部分）。以这种方式召集的单位属于该组织，并会在战斗之间持续存在，直到它们被解散。它们必须符合单位依赖的规则。",
	"An officer of the organization can muster the organization's special unit by succeeding on an Operations test during intrigue (see the {@b Operations} section on page 23, and the details of special units in each organization's write-up in the {@b Domains & Intrigue} chapter). This unit disbands after the next battle it is used in, and must be mustered again before it can be used again. This unit ignores unit dependencies.": "组织的一名官员可以在阴谋中通过成功进行一次行动测试来召集组织的特殊单位（请参阅第23页上的{@b Operations}部分，以及每个组织介绍中的特殊单位详情在{@b Domains & Intrigue}章节）。该单位在下一场战斗后解散，并且必须在再次使用之前重新召集。该单位忽略单位依赖关系。",
	"An officer of the organization can recruit new units from NPC realms by succeeding on a Diplomacy test during intrigue (see the {@b Diplomacy} section on page 20 in the {@b Domains & Intrigue} chapter), gaining the use of that realm's special unit. Units gained by diplomacy disband after the next battle they are used in, and return to their home domain. Additional diplomacy is necessary if they are to be fielded again. These units ignore unit dependencies.": "组织的官员可以在阴谋中通过成功进行外交测试来从NPC领域招募新单位（请参阅第20页中的{@b Diplomacy}部分，在{@b Domains & Intrigue}章节中），获得该领域特殊单位的使用权。通过外交获得的单位在下一场战斗后解散，并返回其所属领域。如果要再次投入使用，需要进行额外的外交。这些单位无视单位依赖关系。",
	"All units, regardless of how they are raised, need a commander. Units that conform to the rules for unit dependencies can be used to unlock new units based on their tier, but units that ignore unit dependencies cannot. For example, a Tier III unit mustered as an organization's special unit or recruited through diplomacy does not count toward being able to muster a Tier IV unit.": "所有单位，无论如何提升，都需要一个指挥官。符合单位依赖规则的单位可以用来解锁基于其等级的新单位，但忽略单位依赖的单位则不能。例如，作为组织特殊单位集结或通过外交招募的三级单位，不计入能够集结四级单位的条件。",
	"The GM determines which ancestries an organization has access to when raising units. It's reasonable to assume a dwarf officer would know other dwarves, and that the officer's heroism has become known in their homeland. So when this heroic dwarf puts out the call, a unit of dwarves arrives! That said, a dwarf officer might be an exile, or might have been raised in a human city and have no real connection to any ancestral home. If so, the GM might decide that a different ancestry is available instead.": "在提升单位时，GM决定组织可以访问哪些血统是合理的。可以假设一个矮人军官会认识其他矮人，并且这位军官的英勇事迹在故乡已经广为人知。因此，当这位英勇的矮人发出号召时，一支矮人单位就会到达！不过，值得注意的是，一个矮人军官可能是被流放者，或者可能是在人类城市长大，与任何祖居地都没有真正的联系。如果是这样，GM可能会决定提供不同的血统作为选择。",
	"If the characters' organization is on good terms with a nearby NPC elf domain—perhaps because of interactions during a previous adventure—it's reasonable to assume that the organization can muster elven units. But the only way to muster the Court Jesters—a special aerial unit of veteran sprites with medium equipment belonging to a fey court domain—is through Diplomacy.": "如果角色的组织与附近的NPC精灵领地关系良好——也许是因为在先前的冒险中互动过——那么可以合理地假设该组织可以调动精灵部队。但要调动法庭小丑（一个特殊的空中部队，由中等装备的老练小精灵组成，属于一个仙界法庭领地），唯一的方法是通过外交。",
	"There are four types of units—infantry, artillery, cavalry, and aerial. Each has different base stats, and because of the rules governing which units can attack other units (see {@b Attacking}) and the rules for deployment, each has a specific role to play in warfare.": "有四种类型的单位——步兵，炮兵，骑兵和空军。每种单位都有不同的基本属性，由于规定了哪些单位可以攻击其他单位（见{@b Attacking}）以及部署规则，每种单位在战争中都有特定的作用。",
	"Infantry are the meat-and-potatoes troops for any domain. They are not as flashy as artillery or cavalry, but they are harder to kill, having higher Toughness than other units of the same tier and ancestry. Infantry are often used to protect artillery units.": "步兵是任何领域的主力部队。他们虽然没有炮兵或骑兵那么引人注目，但由于拥有比同级别和祖先单位更高的坚韧度，因此更难被击败。步兵通常被用来保护炮兵单位。",
	"Infantry have very few legal targets in a battle. They can attack only adjacent units (in front, behind, to the left, or to the right of the infantry unit), and can't attack cavalry or aerial units at all. But infantry also have access to more maneuvers than other units. Only infantry units can use the Follow Up maneuver, which gives them free movement after an adjacent opposed unit breaks or moves away from them. This helps infantry quickly move into position to get closer to the opposed side's center rank—where all the squishy archers are usually hiding!": "步兵在战斗中有非常有限的合法目标。他们只能攻击邻近单位（在步兵单位的前方、后方、左侧或右侧），而且根本不能攻击骑兵或空中单位。但步兵也比其他单位拥有更多的机动性。只有步兵单位可以使用跟进（Follow Up）机动，这使他们在邻近对立单位被击溃或移开后获得自由移动。这有助于步兵迅速移动到位置，以靠近对立方的中央阵线——那里通常藏着所有脆弱的弓箭手！",
	"Infantry can also make use of the Set for Charge maneuver, which gives them a chance of inflicting casualties on any cavalry or aerial unit that attacks them. They cannot attack those more mobile units back, but they are not completely defenseless against them.": "步兵也可以利用冲锋阵型，这让他们有机会对任何攻击他们的骑兵或空中单位造成伤亡。他们不能反击那些更机动的单位，但他们并不是完全无法抵抗它们。",
	"Infantry also include a domain's levies—the untrained troops who have either volunteered to support a domain or been pressed into service. Levies are cheaper than other Tier I units, with officers able to muster two units of levies instead of any other Tier I unit. But they have poor stats compared to other infantry units, and those stats cannot be improved. Levies disband after every battle.": "步兵也包括领地的征兵——这些未经训练的士兵，他们要么自愿支持领地，要么被征召入伍。征兵比其他I级单位更便宜，军官可以动员两个征兵单位，而不是其他I级单位。但是他们的属性与其他步兵单位相比较差，而且这些属性无法提高。征兵在每次战斗后解散。",
	"The best use of levies is to defend a domain's rear rank against enemy cavalry. They often won't last long, but they'll force an opponent to waste actions wearing them down.": "最佳使用民兵是用来保卫领地的后方免受敌方骑兵的攻击。它们通常不会持续太久，但会迫使对手浪费行动来削弱它们。",
	"Artillery units include both archers and siege engines. Mostly archers.": "炮兵单位包括弓箭手和攻城器械。主要是弓箭手。",
	"Artillery units can attack any other unit on the field, which means they're a domain's best defense against enemy aerial units. Those are thankfully rare, but archers' ability to pick targets from across the battlefield makes them incredibly good at two things—forcing Morale tests by diminishing opposed units, and breaking opposed units that have only 1 casualty remaining, regardless of where those units are.": "炮兵单位可以攻击战场上的任何其他单位，这意味着它们是领地对抗敌方空中单位的最佳防御。这些敌方空中单位幸好并不常见，但弓箭手们能够从战场的任何地方选择目标，使他们在两个方面非常擅长——通过削弱对立单位来迫使士气检定，以及击溃只剩下1点伤亡的对立单位，无论这些单位在何处。（Morale） (Archers)",
	"Additionally, archers and cavalry can be coordinated to pick out a single enemy cavalry unit and wear it down, since archers and cavalry can attack any cavalry unit. Many battles begin with both sides using archers and cavalry in this way, trying to eliminate opposing cavalry before they can go on the offensive.": "此外，弓箭手和骑兵可以协调行动，选定一个敌方骑兵单位进行消耗，因为弓箭手和骑兵可以攻击任何骑兵单位。许多战斗开始时，双方都会以这种方式使用弓箭手和骑兵，试图在对方骑兵发动进攻之前消灭它们。",
	"The downside, of course, is that archers are incredibly squishy. They have low Defense and Toughness compared to other troops of the same tier and ancestry. For this reason, they must be deployed in the center rank of the battlefield, and a large part of the strategy of a domain's officers typically involves keeping their archers alive.": "当然，弓箭手的缺点在于他们非常容易被击败。与同一级别和血统的其他部队相比，他们的防御和坚韧度较低。因此，他们必须部署在战场的中间排，一个领地官员的策略的重要部分通常涉及保护他们的弓箭手的生存。",
	"Siege Engines are usually Tier II units, so they're harder to muster. They can attack any other units and inflict a lot of casualties—but most require an entire round between attacks doing nothing (loading the catapult or trebuchet, winding the ballista, and so forth). Combined with the fact that they're the only unit that can damage fortifications (which they automatically hit!), siege engines are typically only mustered when a domain is fighting an opposing force with fortifications, and are then used to batter down those walls and towers.": "攻城器械通常是二级单位，因此更难召集。它们可以攻击任何其他单位并造成大量伤亡，但大多数需要整整一轮时间才能进行下一次攻击（比如装填投石机或攻城槌，绷紧弩弓等）。再加上它们是唯一能够破坏防御工事的单位（而且攻城器械的攻击是自动命中的！），通常只有在领地与拥有防御工事的对抗势力作战时才会被召集，并且用来摧毁城墙和塔楼。",
	"Cavalry units move fast and hit hard. They are so mobile that they belong to no specific rank, ranging across the battlefield to attack other cavalry, and pick off those infantry and artillery units foolish enough to leave themselves exposed.": "骑兵部队移动迅速，攻击力强大。它们如此灵活，不属于特定的等级，横跨战场攻击其他骑兵，并消灭那些愚蠢到暴露自己的步兵和炮兵单位。",
	"Cavalry units have greater Power than other units of the same tier and ancestry, and they're one of the few Tier I units that deal 2 damage on a successful Power test. This means they can cause most Tier I units to become diminished with a single successful attack—a size 6 unit taking 1 casualty from a successful Attack test, and then 2 more casualties from a successful Power test!": "骑兵单位比同级别和祖先的其他单位拥有更大的力量，它们是少数在成功力量检定时造成2点伤害的一级单位之一。这意味着它们可以通过一次成功的攻击使大多数一级单位降低士气——一个规模为6的单位在成功的攻击检定中受到1点伤亡，然后在成功的力量检定中再受到2点伤亡！",
	"Many battles begin with both sides trying to neutralize the other's cavalry. Units with the Archers trait are particularly good at this.": "许多战斗都是以双方试图消灭对方骑兵开始的。具有弓箭手特质的单位在这方面特别擅长。",
	"Flying units are rare, with most of them in Tier III and having stats comparable to an average Tier II unit. This is because aerial units can attack any other unit (in the same manner as artillery units) but very few units can return fire against them! Only artillery and other aerial units can attack an aerial unit.": "飞行单位很少见，大多数都在三级单位，并且其属性与普通的二级单位相当。这是因为空中单位可以攻击任何其他单位（类似于炮兵单位），但很少有单位能还击它们！只有炮兵和其他空中单位可以攻击空中单位。",
	"Mustering aerial units gives a domain a major advantage over an opposed domain that has no aerial units with which to defend itself. But while they have clear advantages in battle, aerial units are squishy. They have higher Attack modifiers than other units of the same tier and ancestry, but their need to be lightly armed and armored compared to other units gives them lower Defense and Toughness.": "集结空中单位为一个领地带来了重大优势，而对抗领地没有空中单位来进行防御。但是虽然他们在战斗中有明显的优势，空中单位却很脆弱。他们的攻击修正比同一级别和祖先的其他单位更高，但相比其他单位，他们需要轻装武装和装甲，这使得他们的防御和韧性较低。",
	"Properly used, aerial units can make a big difference in a battle, but they do not represent  instant victory. Rather, much of their usefulness is psychological. An army without aerial units facing an army with aerial units often feels as though it's on the defensive, even if it has archers enough to handle the situation.": "正确使用，空中单位可以在战斗中起到重要作用，但它们并不代表着即时胜利。相反，它们的许多用处是心理上的。一支没有空中单位的军队面对一支有空中单位的军队时，通常会感觉处于防守状态，即使它有足够的弓箭手来处理局势。",
	"A couple of restrictions affect how many units a domain can field, and which units it can field. This stops a battle from growing too large to manage, and simulates the fact that any army will have a very small number of elite units supported by a broad base of regular units. It also prevents domains from fielding an army made up of only one or two extremely nasty units that can't be defeated by a regular army.": "一些限制影响了一个领地可以派出多少单位，以及可以派出哪些单位。这可以防止战斗规模过大而难以管理，并模拟了任何军队都会有少数精英单位支持大量普通单位的事实。这也防止了领地只派出由一两个极其强大单位组成的军队，这种军队无法被普通军队击败。",
	"An officer can command a number of units equal to their proficiency bonus. Every unit a domain fields—both regular units and special units, no matter how those units are gained—must have a commander.": "一名军官可以指挥的单位数量等同于他们的熟练加值。每个领地部署的单位——无论是常规单位还是特殊单位，无论这些单位是如何获得的——都必须有一名指挥官。",
	"Normally, only a domain officer (a player character member of a heroic organization, or the NPC leader and lieutenants for an enemy realm or some other opposed domain) can command units. But the GM might decide to let NPCs allied with a heroic organization command units as well. This is useful in scenarios that demand larger armies but have a small number of players.": "通常，只有领域官员（一个英雄组织的玩家角色成员，或者敌对领域的NPC领袖和副手）才能指挥单位。但是GM可能会决定让与英雄组织结盟的NPC也能指挥单位。这在需要更大规模军队但玩家数量较少的情景中非常有用。",
	"Each unit's tier represents not only its power level relative to other units. It represents the relationship wherein higher-tier units require many lower-tier units to support them, as follows:": "每个单位的阶层不仅代表着相对于其他单位的力量水平。它还代表着更高阶单位需要许多较低阶单位来支持它们的关系，如下所示：",
	"There is no limit to the number of Tier I units (including levies) a domain can field.": "一个领地可以派出的一级单位（包括征兵）数量没有限制。",
	"A domain can field a number of Tier II units one less than its current number of Tier I units.": "一个领域可以派出的Tier II单位数量比当前Tier I单位数量少一个。",
	"A domain can field a number of Tier III units one less than its current number of Tier II units.": "一个领域可以派出的Tier III单位数量比当前的Tier II单位数量少一个。",
	"A domain can field a number of Tier IV units one less than its current number of Tier III units.": "一个领地可以拥有的四级单位数量比当前的三级单位数量少一个。",
	"A domain can field a number of Tier V units one less than its current number of Tier IV units.": "一个领域可以派出的五级单位数量比其当前的四级单位数量少一个。",
	"Remember that whenever a domain raises a regular Tier I unit, it can raise two units of levies instead. Because these levies are also Tier I, they are a quick way of increasing unit numbers to unlock more powerful units—at the cost of fielding much squishier units at the base of an army!": "请记住，每当一个领地提升一个常规一级单位时，它可以提升两个自卫军单位。由于这些自卫军也是一级单位，它们是快速增加单位数量以解锁更强大单位的方法之一——但代价是在军队底层投入更多易损单位！",
	"An example large army of fifteen units lead by a Tier V unit would look like this:": "一个由15个单位组成的大型军队，由一个五级单位（Tier V unit）领导，看起来会是这样的：",
	"A domain's special unit, as well as units raised through diplomacy, ignore unit dependencies. These units can take to the battlefield regardless of what other units are in play for a domain.": "一个领域的特殊单位，以及通过外交筹集的单位，会忽略单位依赖关系。这些单位可以在没有其他单位参与的情况下投入战场。",
	"For each of the units in play for a domain, experience and equipment can both be improved. Units gain experience through battle, and better equipment with money.": "对于领地中的每个单位，经验和装备都可以得到提升。单位通过战斗获得经验，通过金钱购买更好的装备。",
	"The only way to improve a unit's experience is through battle, as follows:": "提高单位经验的唯一方法是通过战斗，如下所示：",
	"Regular units become veteran units if they survive their first battle. Easy!": "普通单位在经历第一场战斗后就会成为老兵单位。简单！",
	"Veteran units become elite units if they survive three more battles. Much harder.": "如果老兵单位在战斗中存活下来，他们将变成精英单位。要困难得多。",
	"Elite units become super-elite units after surviving four more battles (eight total).": "精英单位在经历四场战斗后（总共八场）变成超级精英单位。",
	"Levies cannot be improved, as the untrained troops who make up those units are considered to go back to their lives as soon as their task in battle is done.": "由于组成这些部队的未经训练的士兵在战斗任务完成后被认为会立即返回他们的生活，因此无法改进征兵。",
	"A domain can spend money to upgrade a unit's equipment from light to medium, medium to heavy, and so forth, requiring only a domain action. (Modifying Units on page 23 in the Domains & Intrigue chapter has all this information.) A domain can upgrade as many units as desired with a single domain action, and those units can be upgraded to any level the domain can afford, from light to super-heavy. A domain can upgrade any units it controls.": "领地可以花费金钱将一个单位的装备从轻型升级到中型，从中型升级到重型等等，只需要一个领地行动。(有关所有这些信息，请参阅《领地与阴谋》章节中第23页的《修改单位》。) 一个领地可以在一个领地行动中升级尽可能多的单位，并且这些单位可以升级到领地负担得起的任何级别，从轻型到超重型。一个领地可以升级它控制的任何单位。",
	"Players and GMs might end up with an army fit to a purpose that decisively wins a climactic battle! But now a domain needs a different army for the next threat. To create the opportunity to muster new units, a domain's officers can voluntarily disband any units the domain controls during an extended rest. (The GM determines what an extended rest means in the campaign, but one week of downtime spent managing a domain is a good rule of thumb.) Units must be disbanded carefully, though, or the relationships of unit dependencies might be broken.": "玩家和(`GMs`)可能最终会拥有一支适合决定性赢得高潮战斗的军队！但现在，一个领地需要为下一个威胁组建不同的军队。为了创造集结新部队的机会，一个领地的军官可以在休整期间自愿解散领地控制的任何部队。(`GM`)会确定在战役中休整期的具体含义，但通常一周的空闲时间用来管理领地是一个不错的经验法则。然而，解散部队必须谨慎进行，否则部队之间的依赖关系可能会被破坏。",

	"The battlefield is a grid five spaces wide, divided into two sections for the two opposing forces in a battle. Each section is four rows deep, with each row called a rank.": "战场是一个宽五个空间的网格，分为两个部分，用于战斗中的两支对立力量。每个部分有四行，每行称为一个等级。",
	"The topmost row in each section is the {@b vanguard}, which faces the opposed army. Behind the vanguard is an army's {@b reserve} rank, followed by the {@b center} rank, followed by the {@b rear}.": "每个部分的最顶行是{@b vanguard}，面对着敌军。在先锋部队后面是一个军队的{@b reserve}级别，然后是{@b center}级别，接着是{@b rear}。",
	"In addition to these four ranks, each side also has a {@b front}, which comprises the vanguard plus all enemy ranks. If a unit controlled by a domain moves from that domain's vanguard into the opposing side's vanguard, or even all the way into the opposing side's rear rank, they are still in the controlling domain's front.": "除了这四个等级之外，每一方还有一个{@b front}，包括先锋和所有敌方等级。如果一个领域控制的单位从该领域的先锋移动到对方的先锋，甚至一直移动到对方的后方，它们仍然处于控制领域的前方。",

	"At the start of a battle, all officers commanding units roll initiative. After initiative is determined for a battle, each character and NPC acting as a commander deploys their units in reverse initiative order. In other words, whoever acts last in the combat gets to place all their units first in the battle. If you are playing a battle alongside combat, use the same initiative order for both.": "在战斗开始时，所有指挥单位的军官都要进行先攻骰掷。战斗的先攻确定后，每个扮演指挥官角色的角色和NPC都按照逆先攻顺序部署他们的单位。换句话说，无论在战斗中谁最后行动，都可以首先在战斗中部署他们的所有单位。如果你在战斗中参与战斗，请为两者使用相同的先攻顺序。",
	"During deployment, each unit commander places a die on every unit they control. This is the casualty die representing the number of casualties the unit can suffer before it breaks. The number of casualties the unit has remaining should be facing up. So a size 6 unit would begin with a d6 casualty die, with the 6 facing up.": "在部署过程中，每个单位指挥官都会在他们控制的每个单位上放置一个骰子。这是代表单位在崩溃之前可以承受的伤亡人数的伤亡骰子。单位剩余的伤亡人数应该朝上显示。因此，一个大小为6的单位将从一个d6伤亡骰开始，6朝上。",
	"Some domain features can increase the size of a unit's casualty die. {@b Increasing a casualty die} means upgrading from a d4 to a d6, a d6 to a d8, and so forth. Decreasing a casualty die means downgrading in the same way.": "一些领域特性可以增加单位的伤亡骰大小。{@b Increasing a casualty die} 意味着从d4升级到d6，从d6升级到d8，依此类推。减小伤亡骰意味着以相同方式降级。",
	"As a unit suffers casualties, its casualty die is {@b decremented}. This means the number on the die is decreased by 1, so that a 6 becomes a 5, a 5 becomes a 4, and so forth. Under certain circumstances, the die is {@b incremented}—increased by 1—to indicate that a unit's battle readiness is being restored. A unit that has its casualty die decremented from 1, indicating that it has lost its last casualty, is {@b broken} and removed from the field.": "当一个单位遭受伤亡时，它的伤亡骰子为{@b decremented}。这意味着骰子上的数字减少1，因此6变成5，5变成4，依此类推。在某些情况下，骰子为{@b incremented}—增加1—表示单位的战备正在恢复。当一个单位的伤亡骰子从1减少，表示它已经失去了最后一名伤亡，那么它被{@b broken}并从战场上移除。",

	"At the start of any round (including the first), if a rank contains no units or fortifications (see below), that rank collapses and is no longer part of the battlefield. The ranks in front of and behind the collapsed rank are now next to each other. Ranks that remain on the field keep their name and rules. For instance, if a rear rank collapses, the center rank next to it remains the center rank.": "在任何回合的开始时（包括第一回合），如果一个等级不包含单位或要塞（见下文），那个等级就会坍塌并不再是战场的一部分。坍塌的等级前后的等级现在是相邻的。仍然留在战场上的等级保留它们的名称和规则。例如，如果一个后方等级坍塌，旁边的中间等级仍然是中间等级。",

If one of a realm's officers is known to do magical deals with a mysterious supernatural figure, a martial advantage from the warlock table makes sense. However, a GM who does this should avoid any advantages that would allow a realm's commanders to rally troops in the middle of a battle. The ability to rally a unit during the fight is intentionally framed as a heroic action. And more importantly, if both sides can rally their troops in the middle of battle, that battle will drag on tediously and quickly stop being fun.": "除了从任何三个对立指挥官表中获得的武术优势外，GM也可以自由选择来自角色职业表的武术优势。如果一个王国的军官中有人被认为与一个神秘的超自然人物做了魔法交易，那么从术士表中选择一个武术优势是有道理的。然而，GM应该避免任何能让一个王国的指挥官在战斗中集结部队的优势。在战斗中集结部队的能力被故意设定为一种英雄行为。更重要的是，如果双方都能在战斗中集结他们的部队，那场战斗将会变得枯燥乏味，并很快停止有趣。",
	"A fortification is a structure occupying a number of spaces on the battlefield, typically on the side of the force that is the defender in the battle. Units in those spaces gain benefits based on the type of fortification. The GM determines which fortifications are available to each side in the battle (both existing fortifications and fortifications raised during play) and in which spaces those fortifications appear.": "一个要塞是一个占据战场上若干空间的结构，通常位于战斗中充当防守方的一侧。占据这些空间的单位会根据要塞的类型获得一些好处。GM决定在战斗中每一方可以使用哪些要塞（包括已有的要塞和游戏过程中建造的要塞），以及这些要塞出现在哪些空间。",
	"Each fortification provides a bonus to Morale for all allied units of the side that controls the fortification, regardless of where those units are on the battlefield. (If there are multiple fortifications on the battlefield, allied units use the highest bonus to Morale for any of their side's fortifications.) As well, each fortification provides a bonus to Defense for any units in the same space as the fortification, and a tower fortification provides a bonus to Power for any artillery units in the same space. (Siege weapons cannot be placed on towers.)": "每个要塞都会为控制该要塞的一方的所有盟军单位提供士气奖励，无论这些单位在战场上的何处。（如果战场上有多个要塞，则盟军单位将使用他们一方任何要塞提供的最高士气奖励。）此外，每个要塞还会为与要塞在同一空间的单位提供防御奖励，而塔式要塞会为同一空间中的炮兵单位提供力量奖励。（攻城武器不能放置在塔上。）",
	"The Basic Fortifications table provides a breakdown of fortifications, their sizes, and the bonuses they provide. All bonuses provided by a fortification are lost if the fortification is destroyed. A rank with a Fortification in it does not collapse when there are no units in that rank.": "基本防御工事表提供了防御工事的分类、大小和提供的奖励。如果防御工事被摧毁，所有提供的奖励都会丢失。如果一个等级中有一个防御工事，当该等级中没有单位时，该等级不会倒塌。",

	"Many of the units that make up the armies in the warfare rules are organized by ancestry. Six of the most common ancestries are discussed below—humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, goblinoids (including hobgoblins and bugbears), and undead. These ancestries cover many of the peoples and forces that players and GMs might commonly recruit from, with other ancestries available through the special unit deck (see below).": "在战争规则中，组成军队的许多单位都是按照血统组织的。以下讨论了六种最常见的血统——人类，精灵，矮人，兽人，哥布林族（包括兽人和巨熊），以及不死族。这些血统涵盖了玩家和GM可能常常招募的人民和力量，其他血统可以通过特殊单位牌组获得（见下文）。",
	"Organizing units by ancestry is completely arbitrary, but still useful. If it makes sense for a specific campaign, any of these ancestries can be easily reskinned and referred to as specific nations, tribes, or domains. In an all-human campaign, dwarf units could represent a line of human mountain folk, while elf units stand in for the soldiers of a steadfast forest realm. In the same way, not all elf units need the same traits. A GM might develop three or four additional traits for different courts of elves in their world, so that only one court gets the Eternal trait.": "按照血统组织单位完全是任意的，但仍然很有用。如果对于特定的战役有意义的话，任何这些血统都可以很容易地被重新打造，并被称为特定的国家、部落或领地。在一个全人类的战役中，矮人单位可以代表人类山地民族的一支，而精灵单位则可以代表坚定森林王国的士兵。同样，不是所有的精灵单位都需要具有相同的特征。一个GM可能会为他们的世界中的不同精灵宫廷开发三到四个额外的特征，这样只有一个宫廷会获得“永恒”特征。",
	"Each of the standard ancestries features nine units, including a variety of infantry, cavalry, and artillery units covering Tiers I, II, and III. It's possible to build a solid army using just the units from those ancestries, making use of the characters' and NPCs' backgrounds and alliances.": "每个标准血统都包括九个单位，包括各种步兵、骑兵和炮兵单位，涵盖了等级I、II和III。可以仅使用这些血统的单位建立一支强大的军队，利用角色和NPC的背景和联盟。",
	"It's important to note that the way members of a given ancestry organize for war can be very different from how they perform during adventuring or when fighting a dragon single-handed. In other words, the stats a member of an ancestry has in combat are not related to the ancestry's stats in warfare. The things that make a good adventurer don't necessarily make a good soldier. Instead, these rules focus on how members of a particular ancestry might organize in large companies, how good they are at taking orders, how seamlessly they coordinate with dozens of other soldiers, and how they maintain their cool while taking casualties.": "重要的是要注意，某个祖先的成员在战争中的组织方式可能与他们在冒险或单枪匹马对抗巨龙时的表现大不相同。换句话说，一个祖先的成员在战斗中拥有的属性与该祖先在战争中的属性无关。使一个好冒险者的品质不一定会使一个好士兵。相反，这些规则侧重于特定祖先的成员如何在大型队伍中组织，他们在接受命令方面的能力如何，他们如何与其他数十名士兵无缝协调，以及他们在承受伤亡时如何保持冷静。",
	"As such, the typical stats for an elf, dwarf, or zombie in the core rules don't translate mathematically into a unit's stats. Rather, a unit focuses on culture, training, and behavior as those things apply to the requirements of a large battle. By the same token, the soldiers represented by units are not adventurers. Though they have solid combat skill, their training is mostly focused on fighting together and not breaking under pressure. A battle in a dungeon or a dragon's lair is not a place for a hundred soldiers trained with pike and shield, accustomed to deploying in formation and to count on the soldiers in front of, behind, and beside them. Army battles take place in wide-open spaces to allow this sort of unit to make best use of its soldiers' training. Cram them all into a series of 10-foot-wide corridors without light, and it drastically reduces their effectiveness.": "因此，在核心规则中，精灵、矮人或僵尸的典型属性并不能数学上转化为单位的属性。相反，一个单位侧重于文化、训练和行为，这些都适用于大规模战斗的要求。同样，单位所代表的士兵并非冒险者。虽然他们具有扎实的战斗技能，但他们的训练主要集中在共同作战，不会在压力下崩溃。在地牢或龙穴中的战斗并不适合一百名以长矛和盾牌训练有素、习惯于编队作战并依赖于前方、后方和旁边士兵的士兵。军队的战斗发生在开阔空间，以便让这种单位最好地利用士兵的训练。如果把他们都塞进一系列只有10英尺宽的走廊里，而且没有光线，那将大大降低他们的效力。",
	"An army might have some kind of special operations section whose soldiers function more like adventurers, at least in terms of their skill sets. But for the most part, those sorts of soldiers are not the soldiers in a standard unit.": "一个军队可能会有某种特种作战部队，他们的士兵更像冒险者，至少在技能方面是这样。但在大多数情况下，这类士兵并不是标准部队中的士兵。",
	"Humans are feeble and weak compared to most of the other ancestries in the book. They have no ancestral bonus to Attack, Power, Defense, or Toughness. What pathetic creatures! However, they are better than most other ancestries at two things: Morale and Command. And as it turns out, these are critical elements to success on the battlefield. Human units are thus less likely to break and run when the battle gets tough or things get weird. And they're better at executing complex commands, which means their infantry are more likely to succeed on maneuvers such as Follow Up and Set for Charge. Taken in combination with the Adaptable trait that all human units have—granting advantage on Morale and Command tests—and humans are an ancestry optimized for warfare.": "人类相比于书中的大多数其他祖先是软弱无力的。他们在攻击、力量、防御或坚韧度上没有祖先加成。多么可悲的生物啊！然而，他们在两件事上比大多数其他祖先更擅长：士气和指挥。事实证明，这些是战场成功的关键因素。因此，当战斗变得艰难或事情变得奇怪时，人类单位更不容易溃退。他们更擅长执行复杂的指令，这意味着他们的步兵更有可能成功执行后续行动和冲锋准备等操作。考虑到所有人类单位都具有的适应性特质——在士气和指挥测试中获得优势——人类是一种为战争而优化的祖先。",
	"Many are the commanders who've looked out at a pathetic band of spindly humans and imagined them to be easy pickings—only to experience real dread and terror when the humans don't break. They don't run. Rather, they stand fast. They hold their ground. And they think tactically. Each ancestry has its own specialty in the field of war. But for humans, their specialty is war.": "许多指挥官曾经看着一群瘦弱的人类，认为他们容易对付，却在人类不退缩时体验到真正的恐惧和惊慌。他们不逃跑。相反，他们坚守阵地。他们保持冷静思考。每个种族在战争领域都有自己的专长。但对于人类来说，他们的专长就是战争。",
	"Human armies are versatile. The best armies have a variety of units: infantry, cavalry, and artillery, and humans are equally good at all of these. This means you can field a balanced army, evenly divided between these disciplines. However, it's your army. You should muster the units you think are fun to field. Try an army with lots of archers! Or use your domain's Espionage skill to spy on the enemy, learn their army's composition, and muster units to thwart them!": "人类军队是多才多艺的。最好的军队拥有各种类型的单位：步兵，骑兵和炮兵，而人类在所有这些方面都同样擅长。这意味着你可以组建一个平衡的军队，均匀分配在这些领域之间。然而，这是你的军队。你应该集结你认为有趣的单位。尝试一个拥有大量弓箭手的军队！或者利用你领地的间谍技能来窥探敌人，了解他们军队的构成，并集结单位来阻止他们！",
	"If you don't know which units your enemy is fielding, try mustering the Hounds of Dalrath. They gain a bonus against most of the units the GM is likely to use.": "如果你不知道敌人正在使用哪些单位，试着召集达尔拉斯的猎犬。它们对大多数GM可能使用的单位都有额外加成。",
	"Elf units are better on Attack than other ancestries in this book, representing their hereditary affinity with sword and bow. Elf units include some of the best archers in the game, though they are otherwise physically unimpressive on the battlefield. That said, elf units are highly mobile, making it easier for them to exploit any holes in an enemy's defenses. If a unit breaks or uses the Retreat maneuver, elf infantry will very likely move into position to take advantage of that gap.": "本书中，精灵单位在攻击方面比其他种族更出色，这代表了他们与剑和弓的遗传亲和力。精灵单位包括一些游戏中最优秀的弓箭手，尽管在战场上他们在体格上并不出色。话虽如此，精灵单位非常机动，这使得他们更容易利用敌人防御中的任何漏洞。如果一个单位溃败或使用撤退机动，精灵步兵很可能会移动到有利位置，以利用这个缺口。",
	"As well, elf units have the Eternal trait. Undead and infernal creatures are no different to them than humans, dwarves, or goblins. As such, the soldiers of an elf unit don't experience existential dread at seeing a zombie horde shuffling toward them any more than they do in response to a human horde. This makes them better at holding their ground in the face of units that strike fear into the hearts of soldiers of other ancestries.": "此外，(elf) 精灵单位拥有永恒特质。对于他们来说，不死族和地狱生物与人类、矮人或地精没有任何不同。因此，精灵单位的士兵在看到僵尸群向他们蹒跚而来时并不会像看到人类群体那样感受到存在恐惧。这使得他们更擅长在面对那些让其他种族士兵心生恐惧的单位时保持阵地。",
	"Elf armies favor archers! No surprise there. The Elven Thorns are one of the best artillery units in the game. Weakening opposed units with the Thorns is a powerful strategy likely to contribute to your victory. But the Forest Mist unit is also not to be underestimated.": "精灵军队偏爱弓箭手！这一点毫不奇怪。 精灵荆棘（Elven Thorns）是游戏中最优秀的炮兵单位之一。 用荆棘削弱对方单位是一种强大的策略，很可能有助于你的胜利。 但森林雾（Forest Mist）单位也不容小觑。",
	"Like many well-trained infantry units in the book, the Forest Mist gains a bonus to Defense when it moves into a gap left by an opposed unit after a successful Follow Up maneuver. In addition to the Forest Mist's high Defense, they can plunge into gaps of the opposed infantry without worrying too much about taking casualties as a result.": "就像书中许多训练有素的步兵部队一样，(Forest Mist)（森林薄雾）在成功进行跟进动作后，进入对方部队留下的空隙时会获得防御加成。除了(Forest Mist)（森林薄雾）本身高防御力之外，他们可以毫不担心地冲入对方步兵的空隙，而不用太担心遭受伤亡。",
	"Dwarves are a hardy folk, granting their units greater natural Toughness than the units of other ancestries. This makes them excellent infantry, and dwarf infantry units are among the best in the game. Dwarf units also have the Stalwart trait, meaning that even after a dwarf unit is diminished, it is very hard to break it.": "矮人是一个坚韧的种族，使他们的单位比其他血统的单位具有更高的自然坚韧度。这使得他们成为优秀的步兵，矮人步兵单位在游戏中是最好的之一。矮人单位还具有坚忍特质，这意味着即使矮人单位被削弱，也很难击溃它。",
	"Infantry should be the meat and potatoes of any dwarf army, but dwarves field good artillery and cavalry too! Dwarves favor crossbows for their foot soldiers, and these are devastating at close range. But artillery must deploy into the center rank, so a skilled dwarf commander focuses on using their infantry to open some space in the front rank, and then move their artillery units adjacent to opposed units to maximize their close-range effectiveness.": "步兵应该是任何矮人军队的主力部队，但矮人也拥有出色的炮兵和骑兵！矮人偏爱给他们的步兵配备弩，这在近距离时是毁灭性的。但炮兵必须部署到中央队列，因此一个技艺高超的矮人指挥官会专注于利用他们的步兵在前排开辟一些空间，然后将他们的炮兵单位移动到对立单位旁边，以最大化它们的近距离效果。",
	"Orcs share the elves' affinity with weapons (granting a bonus to an orc unit's Attack) and have increased Toughness that makes them excellent soldiers. But their most potent asset is the Relentless trait, which allows an orc unit in danger of breaking to keep fighting and stay on the field. An orc unit reduced to the very last of its soldiers can keep fighting almost indefinitely!": "兽人与精灵一样擅长武器（为兽人单位的攻击提供奖励），并且具有增加的坚韧度，使它们成为优秀的士兵。但它们最强大的资产是无情特质，这使得处于溃败边缘的兽人单位能够继续战斗并留在战场上。一支兽人单位即使只剩下最后一名士兵，也能几乎无限地继续战斗！",
	"Orcs are the traditional enemies of human, elf, and dwarf armies, known for their proud and fierce culture and traditions. But a domain that can avoid conflict to ally with orcs (typically in exchange for assurances of respect for territorial boundaries and mutual defense in times of need) can gain access to powerful units. An entire orc army with the Relentless trait is a thing few enemies are prepared to face. But orc units have a wide array of other traits.": "兽人是人类、精灵和矮人军队的传统敌人，以其骄傲和凶猛的文化和传统而闻名。但一个领地如果能够避免冲突并与兽人结盟（通常是以尊重领土边界和在需要时提供相互防御的保证为交换条件），就可以获得强大的部队。一个拥有无情特质的完整兽人军队是很少有敌人准备面对的。但兽人部队还拥有各种其他特质。",
	"The Bloodwalkers can outflank any enemy, making them the equivalent of super scouts. And the orc cavalry known as the Hellriders ride nightmares, which grant that unit the Harrowing trait. Most enemies find the presence of these hell steeds on the battlefield a serious blow to morale, and opposed artillery struggle to focus on targets whose Jaunt trait allows them to attack, then shift into the Ethereal Plane where they cannot be reached.": "血行者可以绕过任何敌人，使它们成为超级侦察兵的等同物。而兽人骑兵，即地狱骑士，骑着噩梦，这使得该部队具有惊骇特质。大多数敌人发现战场上这些地狱坐骑的存在对士气造成严重打击，而对抗炮兵则很难集中精力攻击那些具有瞬移特质的目标，让它们可以攻击，然后转移到以太位面，在那里无法被攻击。",
	"Cavalry units gain no bonuses to their stats based on the mount they ride, but different mounts contribute unique traits to their unit. As you can infer from the Hellriders, nightmares add the Harrowing and Jaunt traits to this unit.": "骑兵单位根据他们所骑乘的坐骑不会获得任何属性加成，但不同的坐骑会为他们的单位提供独特的特质。正如你可以从地狱骑士中推断出的那样，梦魇坐骑为该单位增加了惊骇(Harrowing)和瞬移(Jaunt)特质。",
	"A GM who wants to give cavalry units different mounts should easily be able to look at existing mounted units in the game and reverse engineer what that mount does. Nightmares grant the Harrowing and Jaunt traits. Ram-mounted cavalry get the Ram Riders trait, units with elk mounts get the Spit Upon Their Horns maneuver, and so on.": "一个想要给骑兵单位不同坐骑的GM应该能够轻松地查看游戏中现有的骑乘单位，并逆向工程出该坐骑的效果。梦魇（Nightmares）赋予了惊骇（Harrowing）和瞬移（Jaunt）特性。骑着公羊的骑兵获得了公羊骑士（Ram Riders）特性，骑麋鹿的单位获得了喷吐角（Spit Upon Their Horns）技能，等等。",
	"Often at the low end of the pecking order under bigger, stronger species, goblins tend to be pressed into service as levies more so than trained troops. But goblinoids also include the powerful bugbears and the hobgoblins, two peoples whose love of regimentation makes them exceptional soldiers. As such, the proper mix of goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears on the field can prove a match for any other ancestry.": "在更大更强的物种中处于食物链低端的地位，哥布林往往被迫充当征兵，而不是受过训练的士兵。但哥布林族也包括强大的巨魔和地精，这两个种族对纪律的热爱使它们成为了杰出的士兵。因此，在战场上正确搭配哥布林、地精和巨魔，可以与任何其他种族相匹敌。",
	"Bugbear units have huge bonuses to Attack and Defense (and are all Tier III units as a result). They also inspire other goblinoid units to greater deeds, so that an army of goblins with a bugbear unit leading them can be a formidable threat! For their part, hobgoblins are fearless combatants and sound strategists, giving hobgoblin units a better Attack than units of other ancestries, and making them the equal of human units for Morale. Hobgoblin units also make use of the Warbred trait, granting an additional attack after a successful Power test. This can be used to devastating effect as hobgoblin infantry chew through opposing forces—and makes those units easily the equal of humans on the battlefield.": "大古熊单位在攻击和防御方面有巨大的加成（因此都是三级单位）。它们还能激励其他哥布林种族单位取得更大的成就，因此在古熊单位带领下的哥布林军队可能构成一种可怕的威胁！至于半兽人，他们是无畏的战士和明智的战略家，使得半兽人单位的攻击能力优于其他种族单位，并使他们在士气上与人类单位不相上下。半兽人单位还利用了“战驯”特质，在成功的力量测试后获得额外的攻击机会。这可以被用来对敌人造成毁灭性的效果，因为半兽人步兵在战场上消灭敌军，使这些单位在战场上轻易与人类相提并论。",
	"Although goblins are typically no one's first choice for infantry units, their cleverness more than makes up for a lack of physical strength. Goblin Sappers make use of the Dig trait to undermine enemy fortifications, while Goblin Smokers use the Smoke Screen trait to leave opposed units unable to properly retaliate to goblinoid attacks.": "尽管哥布林通常不是人们首选的步兵单位，但他们的聪明程度远远弥补了体力不足的缺点。哥布林工兵利用挖掘特性来破坏敌方要塞，而哥布林烟雾手则利用烟幕特性使对立单位无法有效地对哥布林族的攻击进行回击。",
	"An all-goblin army normally focuses on hobgoblins for infantry, artillery, and cavalry. Goblins are useful as levies and maybe one or two specialized units, such as Goblin Sappers if the enemy has a fortification.": "一个全哥布林军队通常以半兽人作为步兵、炮兵和骑兵的重点。哥布林作为征兵可能会有用，也许还会有一两个专门的单位，比如如果敌人有堡垒的话可能会有哥布林工兵。",
	"Because the Bugbear Heavy Claw unit has traits that can grant free movement and attacks to goblinoid units, it's best to use that unit for an all-goblin army. If you want to spice up an existing army with some goblinoid units, hobgoblins are best.": "因为巨魔重爪单位具有可以为哥布林单位提供免费移动和攻击的特性，所以最好将该单位用于全哥布林军队。如果你想为现有军队增加一些哥布林单位，最好选择半兽人。",
	"Not an ancestry so much as a necromantic tool used by the commanders of evil domains, undead units feature in many NPC-led armies. Low-tier undead units are intended to be expendable, but higher-tier units are quite nasty—and many interesting undead units can be found in the special unit deck.": "并非祖先，而是邪恶领地指挥官使用的一种通灵工具，不死单位出现在许多由NPC领导的军队中。低级不死单位旨在被牺牲，但高级单位非常恶劣——许多有趣的不死单位可以在特殊单位牌组中找到。",
	"The baseline units of an undead army are skeletons and zombies. Skeleton units are destroyed relatively quickly, but zombie units can be as hard to take down as orc units. What makes all undead units especially formidable, though, is the Dead trait and the Harrowing trait. The Dead trait means an undead unit never worries about Morale tests and can't be diminished. Because its soldiers aren't alive, they don't worry about their fellow bonebags being ground up by enemy forces.": "不死军队的基本单位是骷髅和僵尸。骷髅单位很快就会被摧毁，但僵尸单位可能像兽人单位一样难以击倒。然而，使所有不死单位特别强大的是死亡特质和惊骇特质。死亡特质意味着不死单位永远不必担心士气测试，并且不会被削弱。因为它的士兵不是活着的，他们不会担心同伴被敌军碾碎。",
	"The Harrowing trait means that most units of mortal creatures are freaked out by the presence of undead on the battlefield. Elf units pay undead no mind, but the units of other ancestries don't like the prospect of fighting against their own forebears risen from the grave. A sense of dread and foreboding fills the field when undead march, and especially at the beginning of a battle, undead units can have a major advantage!": "恐怖特质意味着大多数凡人生物单位都会被战场上不死生物的存在吓到。精灵单位对不死生物不屑一顾，但其他种族的单位不喜欢与自己的祖先从坟墓中复活的前景作战。当不死生物行军时，一种恐惧和预感充满了战场，尤其是在战斗开始时，不死生物单位可能会占据重要优势！",
	"Undead armies shine once they get past Tier I units. The main purpose of fielding skeletons and zombies is to unlock ghoul, wight, and wraith units! Ghoul Infantry regain lost casualties thanks to the Feast trait, allowing them to feed on the corpses of fallen enemies or allies. And the ghoul artillery unit known as the Fireborn can inflict ongoing damage with fire tokens from their special maneuver.": "不死军队一旦超越一级单位，就会大放异彩。 部署骷髅和僵尸的主要目的是解锁食尸鬼、尸妖和幽灵单位！ 食尸鬼步兵通过“盛宴”特性恢复失去的伤亡，使他们能够吞食倒下的敌人或盟友的尸体。 而被称为火焰使者的食尸鬼炮兵单位可以通过他们的特殊机动从火焰令牌造成持续伤害。",
	"Deathstormers are wight cavalry units that race across the battlefield on skeletal steeds. And the unique Tier III wraith unit known as the Black Wind is even more powerful. Along with the Dead and Harrowing traits, this unit gains bonus movement and can move through other units thanks to its Ethereal trait. This also means units that the Black Wind attacks gain no benefit from fortifications. If you've amassed a large enough army to field the Tier III units, you probably don't need that Zombie Catapult—but you should probably field it anyway, because it's dope.": "死亡风暴者是在骷髅坐骑上奔驰的死灵骑兵单位。而独特的三级幽灵单位，被称为黑风，更加强大。除了具有亡灵和惊骇特性外，这个单位还获得额外的移动能力，并且由于其虚幻特性可以穿过其他单位移动。这也意味着黑风攻击的单位不会受到防御工事的保护。如果你已经积累了足够大的军队来使用三级单位，你可能不需要那个僵尸投石机—但你应该还是部署它，因为它很强大。",
	"Of course there was no way to fit every possible unit anyone might think of into a single book, so MCDM had to produce a supplement to Kingdoms & Warfare: the special unit deck. This features sixty-four nonstandard units from a variety of additional ancestries and monstrous lineages, including dragons, fiends, more undead, kobolds, giants, black puddings, centaurs, gnomes, elementals, and more!": "当然，不可能把每个人可能想到的所有单位都放进一本书里，所以MCDM不得不制作《王国与战争》的补充内容：特殊单位卡组。这包括来自各种额外血统和怪物谱系的六十四个非标准单位，包括龙、恶魔、更多不死生物、狗头人、巨人、黑布丁怪、半人马、侏儒、元素生物等等！",
	"Ultimately though, the three tiers of units across six ancestries in this book, plus the special units that can be mustered by domains, are enough to run any number of interesting, unique battles without resorting to additional special units—especially when those battles include fortifications and different kinds of terrain.": "然而，本书中六个血统的三个单位层次，加上领地可以动员的特殊单位，足以进行各种有趣且独特的战斗，而无需求助于额外的特殊单位——尤其是当这些战斗涉及要塞和不同类型的地形时。",
	"Moreover, it's our hope that the warfare system and the setup of units is clear enough to make creating new units fun. There's no need to buy the special unit deck just to field a single dragon unit for a battle. Rather, just think about the system as presented, imagine how dragons might work in it, and create your own unit—which will probably end up very close to the official dragon units in the special unit deck!": "此外，我们希望战争系统和单位设置清晰明了，让创建新单位变得有趣。无需购买特殊单位牌组来派遣一只龙单位参加战斗。相反，只需考虑所呈现的系统，想象龙可能在其中如何运作，并创建您自己的单位——这样很可能最终会与特殊单位牌组中的官方龙单位非常接近！",
	"Just like the regular game focuses on the characters, these warfare rules are not a competitive exercise. It's still the GM's responsibility to curate content in order to create drama. So while the GM can use the same rules for building the villain's army as the players use to build the characters' army, it is perhaps more important that the army the heroes face is sufficiently challenging. Likewise, the villain's army should reflect the choices the players and characters have made. The heroes can always get in over their heads, bite off more than they can chew, and end up facing overwhelming odds on the battlefield—just as they can in combat with individual enemies.": "就像常规游戏侧重于角色一样，这些战争规则并不是一项竞争性的练习。仍然是GM的责任策划内容以创造戏剧性。因此，虽然GM可以使用与玩家建立角色军队相同的规则来建立反派军队，但更重要的是英雄面对的军队足够具有挑战性。同样，反派军队应该反映玩家和角色所做的选择。英雄们总是有可能陷入困境，贪多嚼不烂，最终在战场上面对压倒性的敌人，就像他们在与个别敌人战斗时一样。",
	"The rules used for designing encounters with monsters apply to the warfare rules as well. Thus \"more units\" is typically a greater challenge than \"better units,\" just like a standard encounter with many more monsters than characters can quickly become a TPK. The villain's army should obey the rules for unit command and dependencies (part of the {@book Building an Army|KaW|3|Building an Army} section starting on page 100). But knowing that an army can field one Tier IV unit does nothing to suggest which unit is best for a particular scenario—and not all units of the same type are equal in battle.": "设计与怪物遭遇相关的规则也适用于战争规则。因此，“更多单位”通常比“更好的单位”更具挑战性，就像一场标准的遭遇中，怪物数量远远超过角色数量可能迅速导致全灭。反派的军队应遵守单位指挥和依赖规则（在第100页开始的{@book Building an Army|KaW|3|Building an Army}部分）。但知道一个军队可以派出一个四级单位并不能说明哪个单位最适合特定情景——同类型的单位并非在战斗中都是平等的。",
	"Players can muster units only from ancestries they have connections or alliances with, or from ancestries predisposed to lend aid through good roleplaying. But the GM {@b should make liberal use of monstrous units}, as well as any units from any ancestry that seems reasonable and dramatic. The GM is not restricted by which ancestries they can field, as long as it seems reasonable that the leaders of an opposed domain would have access to those monsters or ancestries.": "玩家只能从他们有联系或联盟的祖先那里召集单位，或者通过出色的角色扮演获得帮助的祖先。但是{@b should make liberal use of monstrous units}，以及任何看起来合理和戏剧性的祖先的单位。GM在可以派出哪些祖先方面没有限制，只要对立领域的领导人能够接触到那些怪物或祖先看起来是合理的。",
	"Deciding which units to field is not a science. It will take interpretation, guesswork, and experience to properly balance a battle—and to figure out that not all battles should be balanced. And this process doesn't stop once the battle begins! A GM might find that they need to discreetly fudge some die rolls or have units use less than optimal tactics because they realize only midway through the battle that they've overloaded the villain's forces—and that the characters' army is about to have a bad day.": "决定派遣哪些单位并非一门科学。这需要解释、猜测和经验来正确平衡一场战斗——并且意识到并非所有战斗都应该平衡。而这个过程并不会在战斗开始后停止！一个（GM）可能会发现他们需要偷偷地篡改一些骰子点数，或者让单位采用不太理想的战术，因为他们意识到在战斗进行到一半时他们已经给反派的力量负载过多——而角色的军队即将遭遇不幸。",
	"In addition to the general advice for players, GMs should keep the following points in mind when building armies for a villainous realm or any other domain fighting against the characters:": "除了针对玩家的一般建议之外，在为邪恶领域或任何其他与角色对抗的领域建立军队时，GM应牢记以下要点：",
	"If one side has Tier V units, the other side probably should too. But a few heavily upgraded Tier IV units could balance things out.": "如果一方拥有五级单位，另一方也应该有。但是一些经过大幅升级的四级单位也可以平衡局势。",
	"As a general rule, avoid scenarios where one side has many more or much better units than the other side.": "一般来说，要避免一方拥有比另一方更多或更强大单位的情况。",
	"If one side has a super-heavy, super-elite unit, that's fine—as long as it's clear how the other side can make up for that. A good number of veteran medium units might be enough. Strategically, a good army is one with infantry, artillery, and cavalry units. About half an army should be infantry.": "如果一方拥有超重型、超精英单位，那是可以的——只要清楚另一方如何弥补这一点。一支良好的中等单位数量的老兵可能足够了。从战略上讲，一支好的军队应该包括步兵、炮兵和骑兵单位。大约一半的军队应该是步兵。",
	"Tactically, an army should focus on breaking the opposing side's front. If one side's artillery and cavalry are used to try and get to the opposing side's center through the rear while infantry attack the opposed vanguard, that side will probably lose because it's dividing its forces.": "战术上，一支军队应该集中精力打破对方的前线。如果一方的炮兵和骑兵试图从后方进攻对方的中心，而步兵则攻击对方的先锋，那么这一方很可能会失败，因为它在分散兵力。",
	"Once an opposing side's front is broken, the attacking side's units can move around more. This opens up many different strategies, and lets cavalry and artillery units become more flexible.": "一旦对方的前线被打破，进攻方的单位就可以更灵活地移动。这打开了许多不同的战略，并让骑兵和炮兵单位变得更加灵活。",
	"The best use of archers is for picking off units that are close to breaking. (Assuming there are no aerial units to attack!)": "弓箭手最好的用途是清除那些快要溃败的单位。（假设没有空中单位可以攻击！）",
	"It's reasonable for a GM to design a battle meant to be a rout of the characters' forces. But that should happen only if the players have gotten in over their heads in spite of the GM's best efforts to the contrary.": "对于一个GM来设计一场旨在击溃角色力量的战斗是合理的。但只有在玩家尽管GM尽力相反而陷入困境时，这种情况才应该发生。",
	"These rules can always be adjusted for drama and style. Perhaps a particular villain relies on a horde of infantry! But the rules are designed to make it so that an all-infantry army won't be able to bring enough troops to bear to be effective, and will likely inevitably lose to a better-balanced army. Still, GMs should always remember that as with the characters facing off against single foes, {@b the rules for warfare expect the players to face reasonable challenges and win}. The only time this should change (again, as with the regular game) is if the characters have gotten themselves in over their heads because they've done something foolish—particularly against the GM's advice.": "这些规则总是可以根据戏剧和风格进行调整。也许某个特定的恶棍依赖一支步兵大军！但这些规则旨在使得一支全步兵军队无法带来足够的部队来发挥作用，很可能最终会输给一个更加平衡的军队。不过，GM们应该始终记住，就像角色面对单个敌人时一样，{@b the rules for warfare expect the players to face reasonable challenges and win}。唯一应该改变这种情况的时候（同样，就像常规游戏一样）是如果角色们因为做了愚蠢的事情而陷入困境——尤其是违背了GM的建议。",
	"As a rule, opposed units should not be creatures so mighty that the characters would prefer to handle them personally. For example, a 5th-level party's army should not face off against a Red Dragon unit, both because that unit will probably smoke (perhaps literally) the characters' small, relatively inexperienced army—and because the players would most likely prefer that their characters fight that dragon face to face.": "作为一条规则，对立单位不应该是如此强大以至于角色们更愿意亲自处理的生物。例如，一个5级小队的军队不应该面对一支红龙单位，因为那支单位很可能会轻易地（甚至可能是字面意义上的）消灭角色们的小型、相对经验不足的军队——而且玩家们很可能更希望他们的角色与那条龙面对面战斗。",
	"Eventually, though, as the characters level up, what was once a major threat becomes a minor issue. A high-level party with a large, experienced army might see a Black Dragon unit flying around the battlefield and shrug. \"Our army can take care of it.\" These things are relative.": "然而，随着角色升级，曾经的重大威胁变成了小问题。一个高级别的队伍拥有庞大、经验丰富的军队，可能会看到一支黑龙部队在战场上飞来飞去，然后耸耸肩。“我们的军队可以处理它。”这些事情都是相对的。",
	"Because this is a brand-new system and no one is well familiar with it, players and GMs might find themselves in the middle of a battle that's going badly. \"Going badly\" means something undramatic is happening. One side is being routed, while the other side faces few challenges leading to an unearned victory. This scenario is bad no matter whether the player characters are the ones routing or being routed.": "因为这是一个全新的系统，没有人对它很熟悉，玩家和(`GMs`)可能会发现自己陷入了一场局势不妙的战斗中。\"局势不妙\"意味着一些不戏剧性的事情正在发生。一方正在溃退，而另一方面临着很少的挑战，导致了一场不应得的胜利。无论玩家角色是溃退方还是被溃退方，这种情况都是糟糕的。",
	"If this happens, it's a good time for the losing army to deploy their reinforcements. These are new units that arrive on the battlefield in the nick of time to save the day. (Cavalry are traditional reinforcements, but there's no need to be a martyr to tradition.)": "如果发生这种情况，对于失败的军队来说，现在是部署他们的增援部队的好时机。这些是在最后关头赶到战场上拯救局势的新部队。（骑兵是传统的增援部队，但没有必要为了传统而牺牲。）",
	"Reinforcements should be used sparingly, and should always be a dramatic reveal. As just one example, an NPC domain whose leaders decided to stay neutral despite being courted by both the characters and the villain during intrigue makes an excellent source of unexpected reinforcements for either side. If the reinforcements come to aid the heroes, then the players and their characters gain control over them. The GM decides if reinforcements arrive and which units show up. This is a narrative tool used to keep the tension high, though, not a part of the battle setup.": "增援应该谨慎使用，并且应该始终是一个戏剧性的揭示。举一个例子，一个NPC领地的领导人决定保持中立，尽管在阴谋中被角色和反派追求，这为双方提供了一个出乎意料的增援来源。如果增援前来帮助英雄，那么玩家和他们的角色就控制他们。GM决定增援是否到达以及哪些单位出现。这是一个用来保持紧张气氛的叙事工具，而不是战斗设置的一部分。",
	"Strongholds & Followers introduced the idea of {@book Concordance|SaF|5|Concordance}, a numerical value every character possesses that measures how closely aligned they are with their god's or patron's teachings and desires. Anyone who worships a god or follows the teachings of a church or a greater power has Concordance. In a fantasy world where these beings are objectively real and grant their followers access to spells and abilities, any character should be able to petition their god and, if they are found sufficiently pious, receive aid. You can use the Concordance rules in Strongholds & Followers to summon some of the creatures in this book.": "《{@book Concordance|SaF|5|Concordance}与追随者》引入了{@book Concordance|SaF|5|Concordance}的概念，这是每个角色都拥有的一个数值，用来衡量他们与他们的神或主保的教义和愿望有多么一致。任何崇拜神灵或追随教会或更高力量教义的人都拥有一定的和谐度。在一个幻想世界中，这些存在是客观存在的，他们赐予他们的追随者法术和能力的访问权限，任何角色都应该能够请求他们的神，如果他们被认为足够虔诚，就会得到帮助。你可以使用《{@book Concordance|SaF|5|Concordance}与追随者》中的和谐度规则来召唤这本书中的一些生物。",
	"Many of the creatures presented here are designed to be boss monsters: enemies that can take on an entire party by themselves or with a handful of minions. But boss monsters that are just \"higher CR\" often fail to challenge the characters. We've got a solution: {@b action-oriented monsters}.": "这里介绍的许多生物都被设计成boss怪物：可以独自或与少数手下一起对抗整个队伍的敌人。但那些只是“更高CR”的boss怪物通常无法挑战角色。我们有一个解决方案：{@b action-oriented monsters}。",
	"The key to effective solo villains is giving them plenty of opportunities to act and move when it's not their turn. Thus, each action-oriented creature in this book has at least one special bonus action and reaction, as well as \"villain actions\" that let them dominate the battlefield.": "有效的独立反派的关键在于给予他们充足的机会在非自己回合时行动和移动。因此，本书中的每个以行动为导向的生物都至少有一个特殊的奖励动作和反应，以及让他们主宰战场的“反派行动”。",
	"These actions make the boss monsters action-oriented, dynamic, and formidable. Whether fought as an exciting solo challenge or alongside a few easy-to-run minions, action-oriented monsters challenge the characters with dramatic and powerful actions in combat.": "这些行动使得首领怪物更加注重行动，充满活力和强大。无论是作为一个激动人心的单人挑战还是与一些易于操作的手下一起战斗，注重行动的怪物通过战斗中的戏剧性和强大的行动挑战角色。",

	"The second villain action provides {@b crowd control}. It typically fires after the heroes have had a chance to respond once or twice, get into position, and surround the villain. This second action helps the villain regain the upper hand.

	"The One Below All once ruled a continent, and in power he remains after death—he serves in the Court of Decay at the right hand of the Lord of Decay, the Ultralich, {@creature Khorsekef the Infinite|KaW}.": "那位位于所有之下的存在曾统治过一个大陆，在死后仍然保持着力量——他侍奉于腐朽之王、超巫妖{@creature Khorsekef the Infinite|KaW}的右手，在腐朽法庭中执掌权力。",
	"First Pharaoh of the Khemharan Empire, Khorsekef was immortal and ruled for over 3,000 years. It was impossible for the Khem-hor to imagine a world without their god-king. Even now, five millennia later, the fashions and traditions Khorsekef ushered in are synonymous with Khemhara. The cometary impact of his rule still echoes loudly in the desert.": "Khemharan Empire（开姆哈拉帝国）的第一位法老，Khorsekef（科尔瑟凯夫）是不朽的，统治了超过3,000年。对于开姆-霍尔（Khem-hor）来说，无法想象一个没有他们的神王的世界。即使在五千年后的今天，Khorsekef（科尔瑟凯夫）引领的时尚和传统仍与开姆哈拉（Khemhara）等同。他统治的彗星撞击在沙漠中仍然回荡。",
	"Under Khorsekef's rule, the people of Khemhara thrived in the desert. Khorsekef used his power to ensure this, providing an oasis for an entire nation. What his people could not know, because the desert isolated them from the world, was that Khorsekef's rule denied them the right to change or grow. They worshipped their god-king, who never died, and he watched while generation after generation turned to dust at his feet.": "在（Khemhara）的统治下，（Khorsekef）的人民在沙漠中蓬勃发展。 （Khorsekef）利用他的权力确保这一点，为整个国家提供了绿洲。 他的人民不知道的是，由于沙漠将他们与世界隔绝，（Khorsekef）的统治剥夺了他们改变或成长的权利。 他们崇拜他们的神王，他永不死去，看着一代又一代的人在他脚下化为尘土。",
	"Children were born, grew old, married, had children, but nothing ever changed. Names, likenesses, even identities, inventions, and discoveries were endlessly recycled. The Khem-hor thought this was the cycle of the world. The truth was hidden from them.": "孩子们出生，变老，结婚，生子，但一切都没有改变。名字，相貌，甚至身份，发明和发现都在不断重复。Khem-hor认为这是世界的循环。真相对他们隐藏着。",
	"At least, they did not until the coming of the great explorer Lady Agatamori from Higara, who crossed the desert in the ingenious sand ships her engineers built. Lady Agatamori, a cartographer eager to chart new lands, did not bring war, but she caused one. A civil war. A rebellion. A war against time.": "至少，在来自希加拉的伟大探险家阿加塔莫丽女士到来之前，他们并没有这样做，她乘坐她的工程师建造的巧妙沙漠飞船穿越了沙漠。阿加塔莫丽女士是一位渴望绘制新土地的制图师，她并没有带来战争，但却引发了一场战争。一场内战。一场叛乱。一场与时间赛跑的战争。",
	"Khorsekef captured Lady Agatamori and her retinue almost immediately and hid them in one of his pyramids, called hedrons. But it was too late—word spread. There were other humans in the world. Humans who strove, created, invented. Humans who were not bound to the Khem-hor's eternal cycles of rediscovery and reinvention, recycling the same knowledge, even the same identities, through eternity.": "Khorsekef（科尔瑟凯夫）几乎立即俘虏了阿加塔莫丽女士和她的随从，并将他们藏匿在他的一个金字塔中，名为hedrons（赫德隆斯）。但为时已晚——消息已经传开了。世界上还有其他人类。那些努力奋斗、创造、发明的人类。那些并非被困于克姆-霍尔（Khem-hor）永恒的重新发现和重塑循环中，通过永恒重复相同的知识，甚至相同的身份的人类。",
	"Still, this might have remained a rumor, soon forgotten, but for the captain of the Pharaoh's guard who was so overwhelmed by the brightsouled humanity in Lady Agatamori that he smuggled her and her crew out of the Great Tet and into the Atenopolis.": "然而，这件事本可能只是一个谣言，很快就会被遗忘，但是由于法老卫队队长对阿加塔莫丽夫人身上那种光明灵魂的深深感动，他将她和她的船员从大泰特偷运到阿特诺波利斯，这件事才得以为人所知。",
	"Like a virus, understanding began to spread. The people of Khemhara had been lied to. They were not alone in the world, and they did not have to die repeating the same generation over and over.": "就像病毒一样，理解开始蔓延。Khemhara的人民被欺骗了。他们并不孤独，也不必不断重复同一代。",
	"Armed with new knowledge from conversing with the Khem-hor, Lady Agatamori's vizier unlocked the final clue. Khorsekef's hedrons were not, as he had told his people, mausoleums for noble citizens. None were buried there. Instead, the hedrons had been set in certain astronomically significant locations for a secret purpose. The vizier thought he knew why.": "在与卡姆霍尔人交谈后获得新知识的帮助下，阿加塔莫丽夫人的大臣解开了最后的线索。Khorsekef的多面体并不像他告诉他的人民那样，是贵族公民的陵墓。那里没有人被埋葬。相反，这些多面体被设置在某些天文学上重要的地点，用于秘密目的。大臣认为他知道原因所在。",
	"While the Pharaoh's loyal guard closed in on Lady Agatamori's hiding place in the city, brave Khem-hor brought word of the vizier's discovery to the Heironauts, the Pharaoh's cadre of wizards. They quickly assembled the clues and realized they, too, had been lied to. Their position brought so much privilege and luxury that it was easy to trick them into thinking their limited knowledge was the sum total of world lore.": "当法老的忠诚卫士逼近城市中阿加塔莫丽夫人的藏身之处时，勇敢的凯姆-霍尔向法老的巫师团——海罗诺特斯——传达了宰相的发现。他们迅速汇集线索，意识到他们也被欺骗了。他们的地位带来了如此多的特权和奢华，以至于很容易让他们误以为他们有限的知识就是世界知识的全部。",
	"The Heironauts discovered the great lie: the hedrons were engines that stored time, absorbing it from the topology of the manifold, a time-looped reality created by the Pharaoh, and transmitting it into the Infinite Pharaoh to preserve him while stagnating everything else. Nothing in Khemhara changed because nothing could change. Time itself had stopped. Each generation wasn't merely like the previous—it was a single population giving birth to itself, burying itself, over and over through eternity. They thought their pyramids were tombs. But the desert was a tomb, and they were the embalmed.": "时间旅者(The Heironauts)发现了一个巨大的谎言：多面体(hedrons)是储存时间的引擎，从多维空间的拓扑结构中吸收时间，这是由法老创造的一个时间循环的现实，然后将时间传输给无尽法老(Infinite Pharaoh)以维持他的存在，同时让其他一切停滞不前。凯玛哈(Khemhara)没有任何改变，因为没有任何事物可以改变。时间本身停滞了。每一代人不仅仅是和前一代相似—它们实际上是同一个人群不断重复诞生、埋葬自己，直至永恒。他们以为他们的金字塔是陵墓。但事实上，沙漠才是一个坟墓，而他们自己则是被防腐的尸体。",
	"Powerful magics erupted in the desert as the Heironauts broke the oppressive cycle and made massive strides in lore. Within days they discovered new spells, and soon reached a limit imposed by the hedrons. So they focused their lore on the hedrons and began to drain their power for themselves, using the stored time to fuel their magic.": "当赫罗诺特人打破压迫性循环并在知识上取得巨大进展时，强大的魔法在沙漠中爆发了。在几天之内，他们发现了新的咒语，很快就达到了由赫德隆施加的限制。因此，他们将知识集中在赫德隆上，并开始为自己汲取它们的力量，利用储存的时间来为他们的魔法提供能量。",
	"The Pharaoh, their god-king, could not allow this. He used the power given him by the hedrons to bring battle against his own wizards.": "法老，他们的神王，不能容忍这种情况。他利用赫德隆赋予他的力量对抗自己的巫师。",
	"Cause grappled with effect as the War Against Time engulfed the Atenopolis. Though the Pharaoh initially proved stronger, the Heironauts were growing more powerful by the hour. Soon, the very fabric of the manifold would rip, spilling the Atenopolis out into the Real.": "随着时间之战席卷(`Atenopolis`)，原因与结果纠缠在一起。尽管法老最初表现出更强大的力量，但(`Heironauts`)却逐渐变得更加强大。很快，多重世界的结构将会撕裂，将(`Atenopolis`)倾泻到现实世界中。",
	"The Pharaoh then did the unimaginable: He opened the Great Tet. The Great Tet was not like the other hedrons. The other pyramids stored time like batteries, releasing it to perpetuate the manifold Khorsekef created. But the Great Tet had never released its stores of time. The Pharaoh broke the seal on the massive hedron, freeing the millennia contained within. Even the Heironauts had not known of the deep stores of time kept inside—it was an emergency measure Khorsekef had built exactly for this contingency.": "法老接着做了令人难以置信的事情：他打开了伟大的四面体（Great Tet）。伟大的四面体不同于其他的棱柱（hedrons）。其他金字塔像电池一样储存时间，释放出来以延续由Khorsekef创造的多样性。但伟大的四面体从未释放过它所储存的时间。法老打破了这个巨大棱柱的封印，释放出其中蕴含的千年时光。即使是Heironauts也不知道这个内部储存着深厚时光的秘密——这是Khorsekef专门为这种情况建造的应急措施。",
	"Opening the Great Tet, the Infinite Pharaoh drank deep of the eons stored within, but its power was so great no physical vessel could contain it. His atoms burst with stored time and shredded apart, leaving only his will.": "打开了伟大的特特(`Great Tet`)，无限法老深饮其中蕴藏的岁月，但其力量如此巨大，任何物质容器都无法承载。他的原子爆裂，存储的时间撕裂成碎片，只留下他的意志。",
	"The white-eyed, dessicated form that remained was the animated memory of the Will of Khorsekef. He was no longer the Pharaoh. He was now the Ultralich, a mind so powerful no force has yet been discovered that can end him.": "留下的那个白眼、干瘪的形态是科尔瑟凯夫意志的具象记忆。他不再是法老，而是超巫妖（Ultralich），一个思维如此强大，至今还没有发现任何力量能够终结他。",
	"Facing annihilation by the newly dead god before them, minds filled with new spells and ideas from Lady Agatamori and those of their own creation, the Heironauts did something no citizen of the Atenopolis had done in a millennium. They improvised. They dared stand against the pharaoh's stagnant rule.": "在他们面前的新死神的威胁下，心中充满了来自阿加塔莫丽女士和他们自己创造的新咒语和想法，赫罗纳特人做了一件在阿特诺波利斯市民中已有千年未曾有过的事情。他们进行了即兴创作。他们敢于站出来反抗法老陈旧的统治。",
	"\"The gate swings both ways!\" the First Heironaut declared, and her council understood. Using the residual power stored in the remaining hedrons, they invented a ritual to negate the Infinite Pharaoh's millennia-long program.": "“大门双向开启！”第一位航海先驱宣布道，她的议会明白了。利用剩余的赫德隆中储存的力量，他们发明了一个仪式来抵消无尽法老千年的计划。",
	"They took the geometries of the manifold he had created, the cul-de-sac of reality they had lived in for uncounted centuries, and inverted it. They spilled its contents across the timescape, and the Atenopolis reentered the Mundane World.": "他们拿走了他创造的流形的几何形状，他们生活在其中无数个世纪的现实死胡同，并将其颠倒过来。他们将其内容洒在时间空间中，而阿特诺波利斯重新进入了世俗世界。",
	"At the same time, the fabric of the pocket universe they lived in wrapped back against itself, against its center. The point of origin. Khorsekef, the being that had created it.": "与此同时，他们生活的口袋宇宙的织物向内卷曲，回折到它的中心。即起源点。创造了它的（Khorsekef）存在。",
	"Caught within his own imploding manifold, Khorsekef was hurled downward into the Abyssal Wasteland. There, he ascended as the Lord of Decay and the King of Death. The Ultralich, commanding the loyalty of the Court of Decay. They skirmish with the other courts while Khorsekef seeks a way to return to the Atenopolis and restore his infinite rule.": "被困在自己崩溃的多维空间中，库尔瑟克夫（Khorsekef）被投入到深渊荒地。在那里，他升格为腐朽之主和死亡之王。超巫妖（Ultralich）指挥着腐朽之庭的忠诚。他们与其他庭院发生冲突，而库尔瑟克夫则寻找重返阿特诺波利斯（Atenopolis）并恢复他无尽统治的方法。",
	"Khorsekef vowed he would return, and the oracles of Khemhara predicted exactly that for the last several millennia. But in the meantime, an explosion of learning and innovation propels the Khemhor forward. The Pharaohs of the desert weave the Eternal Design in preparation for the Infinite Pharoah's return. If they can complete it before he returns, Khorsekef will find nothing but sand and dust and scarabs where once was a bright civilization—the Khem-hor will have saved themselves and found a paradise.": "Khorsekef发誓他会回来，而凯姆哈拉的神谕预言了过去几千年的情况。但与此同时，一场学习和创新的爆发推动着凯姆霍尔向前发展。沙漠的法老们编织着永恒设计，为无尽法老的回归做准备。如果他们能在他回来之前完成它，Khorsekef将会发现曾经是一个光明文明的地方现在只剩下沙土和尘埃以及甲虫——凯姆-霍尔将拯救自己并找到一个天堂。",
	"The Abyssal Wasteland is a dead plane filled with ruins of once-great cities. Or are they the degenerating reflections of existing cities in the timescape? Sages differ. Demons call this place home, this rotting reality where forgotten gods go to die. It is a land of entropy and the creatures that call the Waste home consider order a poison.": "深渊荒地是一个充满了曾经伟大城市废墟的死亡位面。或者它们是时光之镜中现存城市的堕落倒影？智者们看法不一。恶魔们称这里为家园，这是一个腐烂的现实，被遗忘的神灵前来此地死去。这是一个熵的土地，居住在这片荒地的生物认为秩序是一种毒药。",
	"This is the deepest world in the timescape. Creatures who sink this far down find themselves unable to organize their thoughts, unable to plan or scheme beyond base emotion and survival. Only by feasting on the souls of others can a mind rise above this entropy and muster order enough to plan and, possibly, escape.": "这是时间空间中最深的世界。那些沉入如此深处的生物会发现自己无法整理他们的思绪，无法计划或策划超越基本情感和生存的事情。只有通过吞噬他人的灵魂，一个头脑才能超越这种无序，凝聚足够的秩序来计划，并可能逃脱。",

	"During an encounter, a demon can burn souls to use or enhance certain abilities, decreasing their soul count. Demons gain more souls by slaying other creatures. When a demon reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature must immediately make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw before it falls unconscious and begins dying. On a failed save, the creature's soul is consumed by the demon. The demon adds 1 to their soul count, and the creature immediately dies and subsequently can't be restored to life by any means short of a wish spell.": "在遭遇中，恶魔可以燃烧灵魂来使用或增强某些能力，减少他们的灵魂计数。恶魔通过杀死其他生物来获得更多灵魂。当恶魔将一名生物的生命值降至0时，该生物必须立即进行一次DC 11的感知豁免检定，否则将陷入昏迷并开始垂死。如果豁免检定失败，该生物的灵魂将被恶魔吞噬。恶魔的灵魂计数增加1，该生物立即死亡，并且不能通过除许愿法术之外的任何方式复活。",
	"Soul devouring makes the demons of the Court of the Deep deadly opponents. You can remove this ability and only have a demon devour a soul when a creature dies through normal means within 60 feet of it or adjust the DC of the saving throw to give characters a better chance of living through an encounter with one of these opponents.

	"Thus does the Mindbreaker stay sated with souls. An augur unmatched in foresight and cruelty, she is both mage and anti-mage.": "心灵破坏者通过吞噬灵魂来满足自己。作为一位无与伦比的预言者和残忍者，她既是法师又是反法师。",
	"The greatest demon of the Court of the Deep, Sylt commands the grudging obeisance of fiends within the Abyssal Wasteland. Unlike the others, Sylt has never fallen into lethe—she has transcended it, subjugated it, until the very flow of souls is hers to dominate.": "深渊法庭中最伟大的恶魔，西尔特（Sylt）命令着深渊荒地中恶魔们勉强的顺从。与其他恶魔不同，西尔特从未陷入遗忘之河—她超越了它，征服了它，直到灵魂的流动完全属于她支配。",
	"Sustained by the Bloodheat, Sylt drinks souls in a never-ending flow, feasting on that which empowers the demons and rewarding the legions at her side. Demons under her command find their powers and intellect grow as their supply of howling souls is refueled, effortlessly sustained in a banquet given to her most loyal.": "受到血热的滋养，西尔特(Sylt)不断地饮食灵魂，从未停止的流动中享用那些赋予恶魔力量的东西，并奖赏站在她身边的军团。在她指挥下的恶魔们发现他们的力量和智慧随着嚎叫灵魂的补给而增长，毫不费力地在给予她最忠诚者的宴会中得到滋养。",
	"The Court hates Sylt—she is a dark and fell intelligence who prefers to wait and scheme rather than succumb to temporary hungers. They crave bloodshed and feasts of souls and sinew, impatient with her cunning and insidious plots. But none gainsay her right to rule. Many in the Waste wait for her word to lead them across the timescape in a bloody war of anti-life.": "法庭憎恨希尔特(Sylt)—她是一个黑暗而邪恶的智慧，宁愿等待和策划，而不是屈服于暂时的欲望。他们渴望流血和灵魂的盛宴，对她的狡诈和阴险阴谋感到不耐烦。但没有人敢质疑她统治的权利。荒野中的许多人等待她的命令，引领他们穿越时间之河，参加一场反生命的血腥战争。",
	"In combat, Sylt prefers to use hit-and-run tactics in environments with plenty of cover and places to hide.": "在战斗中，希尔特（Sylt）更喜欢在有大量掩体和藏身之处的环境中使用打击-撤退战术。",

	"Each archdevil sends an emissary to serve in the Court of Seven Cities, as required by the Onyx Edict, the founding document of Hell.

	"All devils have true names that they keep secret, as speaking the true name of a devil within earshot of it can strip it of its supernatural defenses. True names are hard to discover—fiends go to great lengths to bury them. But with enough effort, your Domain could deliver one to you to use as a weapon at a crucial moment in the eternal war against evil. Proclaiming the true name of a devil takes one action, and if the devil can hear you, the proclamation removes its Magic Resistance trait, its damage immunities, and its damage resistances for 24 hours.": "所有恶魔都有他们保密的真名，因为在恶魔听到自己的真名时会剥夺它的超自然防御。真名很难发现——邪恶生物会不遗余力地掩埋它们。但是经过足够的努力，你的（Domain）可能会为你提供一个真名，让你在永恒的对抗邪恶战争中的关键时刻使用。宣布恶魔的真名需要一个动作，如果恶魔能听到你，这个宣言会在24小时内移除它的魔法抗性特征、伤害免疫和伤害抗性。",
	"Each of the Seven Cities of Hell is named after a real \"hell\" (or hell-like analog) from a real culture in our world.": "地狱七城每一个都以现实世界中某个文化中的真实“地狱”（或类似地狱）命名。",
	"This continues a tradition going all the way back to the original game in 1974, a tradition I have a lot of affection for.

	"Earlier editions imagined your cleric might worship gods from our real world! Thor or Ra, for example. Because it presumed those gods lived in their own planes, and those planes were accessible from any Prime Material plane, like Earth or your homebrew fantasy world. Earlier editions even mentioned characters who traveled from our real world to the fantasy RPG world.": "早期版本设想你的(牧师)可能崇拜现实世界的神灵！例如(Thor)或(Ra)。因为它假定那些神灵生活在自己的位面，并且这些位面可以从任何原物质位面访问，比如地球或你自创的幻想世界。早期版本甚至提到了从我们现实世界前往幻想RPG世界的角色。",
	"So the MCDM multiverse, the timescape, imagines that an intrepid planar traveler could arrive in these hells and reimagines them as cities warring through eternity in the larger plane of Hell.": "所以MCDM多元宇宙，时间空间，想象着一个无畏的位面旅行者可以抵达这些地狱，并将它们重新想象成在地狱更大的位面中永恒战争的城市。",
	"These hells are from many cultures, including Greek (Styx, Acheron) and Jewish tradition (Sheol), as well as Mongolian tradition (Kasyrgan). Naraka is from Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist traditions. Finally, Dis is from Christian literature (Dante's Inferno).": "这些地狱来自许多文化，包括希腊（(Styx, Acheron)）和犹太传统（(Sheol)），以及蒙古传统（(Kasyrgan)）。纳拉卡来自印度教、锡克教和佛教传统。最后，地狱（(Dis)）来自基督教文学（但丁的《神曲》）。",
	"These cities are named and included thus because I thought it was a cool opportunity to learn more about different cultures' notions of the afterlife. It was fun, doing this research. It should not be taken as an opportunity to imagine any of these cultures are in any way lesser. They should not be used as an opportunity to trot out hateful, backward, racist tropes. These were behaviorally modern humans like you and me. They led complex internal lives. They weren't ignorant, they just knew different things than we do.": "这些城市被命名并包含在内，是因为我认为这是一个很酷的机会，可以更多地了解不同文化对来世的概念。做这项研究很有趣。不应该把这看作是想象这些文化在任何方面都较差的机会。也不应该用来展示令人厌恶、落后、种族主义的陈词滥调。这些人是行为现代的人类，就像你我一样。他们有复杂的内在生活。他们并不无知，只是了解的东西与我们不同。",
	"And, hopefully, by representing different cultures among these hells that some readers may not be familiar with, some folks might read more about them! Learn how different real-world peoples throughout history have thought about the afterlife. That stuff is super cool and also, I think, makes us better GMs, because we are able to more realistically present our own worlds and peoples.": "希望通过在这些地狱中代表不同文化，一些读者可能不熟悉的文化，一些人可能会更多地了解它们！学习不同的真实世界民族在历史上是如何思考来世的。这些内容非常酷，而且我认为，这能让我们成为更好的(`GMs`)，因为我们能更真实地呈现我们自己的世界和人民。",
	"In the end, these aren't meant to be the real, authentic places described in our earthly cultures, merely a fantasy version appropriate to a pulp fantasy RPG.": "最后，这些地方并不是我们地球文化中描述的真实、正统的地方，而仅仅是适合于一个低俗幻想RPG的幻想版本。",
	"Hate devils are brutal, ferocious infantry. They radiate antipathy so strongly that anyone in their aura begins to hate their friends, their allies—even themselves.": "憎恨魔（Hate devils）是残忍、凶猛的步兵。他们散发出如此强烈的反感，以至于处在他们光环中的任何人都会开始憎恨他们的朋友、盟友，甚至是他们自己。",
	"During the first round of combat, a hate devil attacks from above, using Spit Flame or casting {@spell phantasmal killer} to harm foes that resist its Aura of Enmity. On subsequent turns, the devil lands to focus melee attacks on a flying or ranged combatant before taking back to the skies for defense. The devil is willing to provoke an opportunity attack or two if it means returning to the safety of the skies.": "在战斗的第一轮中，一只仇恨恶魔从空中发动攻击，使用喷火或施放{@spell phantasmal killer}来伤害那些抵抗其敌意光环的敌人。在接下来的回合中，恶魔会降落，专注于对飞行或远程战斗者进行近战攻击，然后再次飞上天空进行防御。恶魔愿意引发一两次机会攻击，只要这意味着能够安全返回天空。",

	"Like other hate devils, Rakat begins combat by flying above their enemies, but remains low enough to ensure they are in the fiend's Aura of Enmity. On their first turn, they cast {@spell power word stun} on a foe with lower hit points than others to ensure the spell's success, and fire their Ray of Antipathy at a creature outside their Aura of Enmity. They use the Divide and Conquer villain action to cut any bard, cleric, or other supportive spellcaster off from a creature affected by {@spell power word stun} or {@condition charmed} by their Aura of Enmity.": "与其他仇恨恶魔一样，拉卡特（Rakat）开始战斗时会飞到敌人上方，但保持足够低的高度以确保它们处于邪恶气息（Aura of Enmity）之中。在他们的第一个回合中，他们会对生命值低于其他敌人的敌人施放{@spell power word stun}以确保法术成功，并向那些不在他们的邪恶气息范围之外的生物发射他们的反感射线（Ray of Antipathy）。他们使用“分而治之”（Divide and Conquer）的反派行动，将任何受到他们邪恶气息影响的生物与{@spell power word stun}或{@condition charmed}的法术影响隔离开来，以阻止任何吟游诗人、牧师或其他支援型法术施法者。",
	"On subsequent turns, Rakat engages characters in melee with {@item Zealcleaver|KaW}, though the devil continues to remain at least 10 feet in the air, benefitting from their long reach.": "在随后的回合中，Rakat与角色进行近战战斗，尽管这只恶魔仍然保持在至少10英尺的高空中，从他们的长臂攻击中获益。",
	"Nearly indestructible, stone devils are the bulwarks of the Seven Cities. No unit of stone devils has ever lost morale in the history of the timescape. Their hearts grind spirits into black soulblood that corrupts everything it touches.": "几乎不可摧毁，石魔鬼是七城的堡垒。在时间空间史上，没有任何一支石魔鬼部队曾经失去过士气。它们的心脏将灵魂磨成黑暗的灵魂之血，腐蚀一切接触到的东西。",

	"The flaw imposed by the devil's Soulblood Trail trait and Foul Ichor action is a temporary affliction that is fun to roleplay for many players, but others truly dislike having a personality change imposed by a failed saving throw. Only use the flaw if you play with the type of players who enjoy incorporating it into the narrative.": "恶魔的灵血之路特性和邪恶浆液行动带来的缺陷是一种暂时的困扰，对许多玩家来说，这种角色扮演很有趣，但其他人真的不喜欢因为豁免扑灭失败而被强加个性变化。只有在与喜欢将其融入叙事的玩家一起游玩时才使用这个缺陷。",

	"Unlike other stone devils, Moranon's villain actions and Disciplined Advance reaction allow him to create hazardous areas using his Soulblood Trail without provoking opportunity attacks. He is less reckless than his soldiers and makes far greater use of Profane Flame, since he can use it as a bonus action or as a reaction using Disciplined Advanced.": "与其他石魔鬼不同，莫拉农(Moranon)的恶棍行为和纪律进取(Displined Advance)反应使他能够利用他的灵血之路(Soulblood Trail)创造危险区域而不会引发机会攻击。他比他的士兵更谨慎，并更多地利用亵渎之焰(Profane Flame)，因为他可以将其用作奖励行动或使用纪律进取作为反应。",
	"Moranon focuses his attacks on arcane spellcasters, believing they are the ones most likely to discover his true name and use magic to bypass his high AC. His advance is calculated and considered. If armored warriors get in the devil's way, he cuts them down, using Disciplined Advance and villain actions to get around such foes and engage spellcasters first, and using Profane Flame to attack those casters if warriors lock him down.": "莫拉农（Moranon）将攻击重点放在奥术法师身上，因为他相信他们最有可能发现他的真名并使用魔法绕过他高的护甲等级（AC）。他的前进是经过计算和考虑的。如果穿戴盔甲的战士挡住了这个恶魔的去路，他会将他们击倒，利用“纪律前进（Disciplined Advance）”和反派行动来绕过这些敌人，首先与法师交战，如果战士们将他困住，他会使用“亵渎之焰（Profane Flame）”来攻击那些法师。",
	"The razors of hell, steel devils are highly mobile terror weapons deployed to wreak maximum carnage in battle. It is impossible to fight one without suffering wounds; even psionic attacks cause the mind to bleed.": "地狱之刃，钢铁恶魔是高度机动的恐怖武器，部署在战场上造成最大的破坏。在不受伤害的情况下与之战斗是不可能的；即使是灵能攻击也会使心灵受伤。",
	"A steel devil uses its incredible speed to engage its enemies in melee combat, since its mere presence can dish out damage to any nearby creature. It prefers to fight warriors foolish enough to remain close to make the most of its Agonizing Visage and Thorns of Pain traits. Even at a distance, the devil's Agonizing Visage and Soul Scalpel can harm foes as it advances.": "一只钢铁恶魔利用其惊人的速度与敌人进行近战战斗，因为它的存在本身就能对附近的任何生物造成伤害。它更喜欢与那些愚蠢到留在附近的战士战斗，以充分利用其令人痛苦的面容和刺痛之刺特性。即使在远处，恶魔的令人痛苦的面容和灵魂解剖刀也可以在其前进时伤害敌人。",

	"Sryz is the ultimate steel devil, and acts much like their counterparts do in combat.

	"On their turn, Sryz spreads the damage around with their six Eviscerating Strikes, dashing with Lethal Agility if need be, then targets a creature they can't reach with Soul Scalpel. Sryz prefers to use Lacerating Presence on a foe that concentrates on a spell to make it more difficult for the creature to maintain a hold on the magic.": "轮到Sryz时，他们使用他们的六次割裂打击将伤害分散开来，如果需要的话，使用致命敏捷进行冲刺，然后瞄准一只无法接触的生物使用灵魂解剖刀。Sryz更喜欢对专注于咒语的敌人使用撕裂存在，以使对方更难以保持对魔法的控制。",

	"Lore devils are living compendiums of spent scrolls and dead codices. Keepers of lost arcane secrets, they wield cunning magics and feed on the energy of weaker mages.": "传说中的恶魔是消耗过的卷轴和死去典籍的活着的总汇。作为失落奥秘的守护者，他们运用狡诈的魔法，吸食较弱法师的能量。",
	"A lore devil prefers to battle foes at range, beginning combat with its Multiattack action, first casting {@spell dominate person} to bring a strong bodyguard to the fiend's side, then using Arcane Bolt twice. The devil continues to use Multiattack, casting {@spell disintegrate} to harm an enemy spellcaster or {@spell reverse gravity} followed by {@spell fireball} and {@spell lightning bolt} on subsequent turns to damage as many foes caught in the upward pull as possible. If a creature gets close enough to make melee attacks against the lore devil, the fiend uses Spelldrain to regain hit points before casting {@spell misty step} or {@spell plane shift} to get away.": "一位传说中的恶魔更喜欢与敌人保持距离作战，开始战斗时会使用其多重攻击动作，首先施放{@spell dominate person}召唤一名强大的护卫到恶魔身边，然后使用奥术箭矢两次。恶魔会继续使用多重攻击，施放{@spell disintegrate}伤害敌方法师或{@spell reverse gravity}，接着在接下来的回合中施放{@spell fireball}和{@spell lightning bolt}，以尽可能伤害到被向上拉扯的多个敌人。如果有生物靠近到足以发动近战攻击的距离，恶魔会使用法术吸取来恢复生命值，然后施放{@spell misty step}或{@spell plane shift}来逃跑。",
	"Note that the lore devil has a damage vulnerability uncommon among the other denizens of hell-fire. Characters don't normally encounter lore devils in flaming wastelands or volcanic lava pits the way they might some other fiends. These devils are smart and stay out of the places in hell that are hazardous to their health.": "请注意，传说中的恶魔在地狱中拥有一种其他居民罕见的伤害易感性。角色通常不会在燃烧的荒地或火山熔岩坑中遇到传说中的恶魔，就像他们可能会遇到其他恶魔一样。这些恶魔很聪明，会远离对它们健康有害的地方。",
	"Some lore devils study ancient infernal rituals that allow them to bind the flesh of other devils to their papery skin. This fiendish essence infuses their pages with durability against flames, removing the vulnerability. Some lore devils gather enough fiendish flesh to perform the ritual several times, making them resistant or even immune to fire damage.": "一些知识魔鬼研究古老的地狱仪式，使他们能够将其他魔鬼的血肉绑定在他们纸质的皮肤上。这种邪恶的本质使他们的纸张具有耐火性，消除了脆弱。一些知识魔鬼收集足够的恶魔血肉，可以多次执行这个仪式，使他们对火焰伤害具有抵抗力甚至免疫力。",
	"Lord Indix is composed of the burning pages of the once-powerful {@item codex mutabilis|KaW}, the Book of Change.

	"The Earl of Sheol is a complex boss monster, and their villain actions are maximally disruptive! To keep the game rolling, consider doing the math on these actions ahead of time.

	"An eye devil attacks from above, casting {@spell dominate monster} to bring the best melee combatant among its foes to its side, followed by {@spell incendiary cloud} on the fiend's second turn. Since the devil's Multiattack action allows it to cast spells and make attacks, it uses Flame Jet and Incinerate to attack enemies that can reach it. The devil uses Malvision on the first turn of combat, hoping to create maximum chaos among its enemies during the battle.": "一只眼魔从上方发动攻击，施放{@spell dominate monster}，将其敌人中最强的近战战士带到自己身边，然后在魔鬼的第二回合使用{@spell incendiary cloud}。由于魔鬼的多重攻击动作允许它施放法术和进行攻击，它使用火焰喷射和焚化来攻击可以接近它的敌人。魔鬼在战斗的第一个回合使用黑暗视觉，希望在战斗中制造最大混乱。",

	"Over time, the dragon's crystals conduct more psionic energies into its body, recharging its power. At the end of each of its turns, roll the recharge die and restore that many charges.": "随着时间的推移，龙的水晶将更多的超能能量传导到它的身体中，重新充电。在每个回合结束时，投掷充能骰，并恢复相应数量的充能点数。",
	"Psionic charges are used to manifest psionic abilities. These manifestations are the primary source of a gemstone dragon's power. All manifestations have a range of 30 feet, unless noted otherwise.": "灵能充能用于施展灵能能力。这些表现是宝石龙力量的主要来源。所有表现的范围为30英尺，除非另有说明。",
	"The following manifestations are by no means the only ones the dragons have access to. It is known that the most powerful gemstone dragons can alter their form at will in a manner that defies all inspection. But these are the most welldocumented and commonly used manifestations available to all psionic creatures.": "龙拥有的表现远不止这些。众所周知，最强大的宝石龙可以随意改变形态，这种能力超乎一切审查。但这些是所有智力生物都可以使用的最为详细记录和常用的表现。",

	"Normal weapons bounce and spark off the crystals protruding from a gemstone dragon's skin. These dragons have resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.": "普通武器在宝石龙皮上突出的晶体上弹开并发出火花。这些龙对非魔法钝击、穿刺和斩击伤害具有抗性。",
	"All gemstone dragons are vulnerable to psychic damage. The same crystalline structure that makes them hard to damage with normal weapons conducts any psionic radiation, causing its latticework to crack and shatter.": "所有宝石龙都对精神伤害有着脆弱的弱点。这种晶莹的结构使它们难以被普通武器伤害，但却会导电任何灵能辐射，导致其晶格破裂并破碎。",
	"All gemstone dragons develop telepathy as they age. Most acquire it when they are young, but the topaz dragons are born with it.": "所有宝石龙在成长过程中会发展出心灵感应能力。大多数在年幼时就会获得这种能力，但黄玉龙是天生具备的。",
	"The gemstone dragons can maintain several persistent manifestations simultaneously, but doing so requires spending 1 charge per manifestation at the start of each of its turns. Whenever a dragon takes damage while concentrating on a psionic manifestation, it must make an Intelligence saving throw to maintain concentration as if concentrating on a spell.": "宝石龙可以同时保持几个持续的显现，但这样做需要在每个回合开始时花费1点充能来维持每个显现。每当一条龙在集中精神于一个智力显现时受到伤害，它必须进行一次智力豁免才能保持集中，就像在施放法术时一样。",
	"When the great Cthrion Uroniziir rose from her slumber, many {@i draco crystalli} were woken, hatching and crawling forth. One of them, Trudy the ruby wyrmling, is new to the struggle to preserve reality against the onslaught of the Würm of the World's End. But though she is, Trudy knows her duty, eager to join the battle and stop the Time Ender from consuming whole realities.": "当伟大的克瑟里昂·乌罗尼兹尔(Cthrion Uroniziir)从沉睡中苏醒时，许多{@i draco crystalli}被唤醒，孵化并爬出。其中之一，红宝石幼龙特鲁迪(Trudy)，是新来的，加入了对抗世界末日巨虫的保护现实的斗争。尽管她是新手，特鲁迪知道自己的责任，渴望加入战斗，阻止时间终结者(Time Ender)吞噬整个现实。",
	"Trudy is still young as the crystal dragons reckon these things, but she is already an expert on the fabric of reality, the many worlds of the timescape, and the people who inhabit them. She talks to herself, constantly analyzes everything and everyone, and is a little oblivious to people's reactions to her. When she gets nervous, she breaks into rhyming couplets, often in Draconic. This can't be helped.": "特鲁迪（Trudy）在水晶龙们看来仍然年轻，但她已经成为现实结构、时间空间中的众多世界以及居住其中的人的专家。她经常自言自语，不断分析一切和每个人，对别人对她的反应有点迟钝。当她紧张时，她会开始用龙语编排押韵的对联。这是无法避免的。",

	"In combat, Relg positions himself among as many enemies as possible to make the most of his Aura of Lethe. The demon welcomes melee combatants and always tries to maintain a soul count of 3 or higher so his Pus-Filled Soul Boils harm those who threaten him.": "在战斗中，瑞尔格（Relg）会将自己放置在尽可能多的敌人中间，以充分利用他的遗忘光环（Aura of Lethe）。这个恶魔欢迎近战战士，并始终努力保持3个或更多的灵魂数量，这样他的充满脓液的灵魂（Pus-Filled Soul）就会伤害那些威胁到他的人。",
	"On his turns, Relg first uses his tentacles to attempt to grab at least one creature so he can use his Reel trait, then uses his axe and horns to threaten other targets he can reach, using Soul Rend early and often to destroy his foes quickly. If a flying creature threatens the demon, he uses Weighted Soul to bring it to the ground.": "在他的回合中，雷尔格首先使用他的触手尝试抓住至少一个生物，这样他就可以使用他的卷绕特性，然后使用他的斧头和角来威胁其他他可以到达的目标，经常早早地使用灵魂撕裂来迅速摧毁他的敌人。如果一只飞行生物威胁到这个恶魔，他会使用沉重灵魂将其击落到地面。",
	"Whenever we present an entirely new system (and this book contains two of them: intrigue and warfare), it seems like a good idea to present new magic items that support these systems. If organizations can act the way heroes do, and if characters can command units, then surely wizards and priests have developed magic to enhance these things!": "每当我们介绍一个全新系统（本书包含两个：阴谋和战争）时，似乎很明智地提出支持这些系统的新魔法物品。如果组织可以像英雄一样行动，如果角色可以指挥单位，那么巫师和祭司肯定已经开发出魔法来增强这些能力！",
	"This section presents new items that help officers better manage their domain and commanders better lead their troops. In addition, we include nine new codices, artifact-level magical tomes that bend the fabric of the timescape.": "这一部分介绍了新物品，帮助军官更好地管理他们的领域，指挥官更好地领导他们的部队。此外，我们还包括了九本新的法典，神器级别的魔法书，可以扭曲时间空间的结构。",
	"Because they were popular in {@book Strongholds & Followers|SaF}, we present nine new reality-bending codices. Each codex is an artifact-level item, written when the world was young and magic not yet tamed. Many codices grant their users incredible power, including the power to raise new units. They should not be looked at as rewards, but rather immense burdens. Threats to the natural order. These tomes are best found locked away in some obscure vault, guarded by a powerful entity who rightly fears what might happen should the codex fall into the wrong hands. Or any hands! Mortals, certainly, can't be trusted with this power. A high-level NPC might ask the heroes to retrieve one after a powerful enemy has wrested it from the bowels of obscurity. For a time, the heroes can use the power within—but this should always be temporary.": "因为它们在{@book Strongholds & Followers|SaF}很受欢迎，我们呈现了九本新的现实扭曲法典。每一本法典都是一个神器级物品，在世界年轻、魔法尚未驯服的时候编写。许多法典赋予使用者令人难以置信的力量，包括召唤新单位的能力。它们不应被视为奖励，而是巨大的负担。对自然秩序的威胁。这些卷轴最好被发现锁在某个隐秘的地下室里，由一个强大的实体守护着，他正确地担心如果法典落入错误之手会发生什么。或者任何手！凡人，当然，不能信任他们拥有这种力量。一个高级NPC可能会要求英雄们在一个强大的敌人从遗忘的深处夺走它之后将其取回。一段时间内，英雄们可以利用其中的力量——但这应该总是暂时的。",
	"Each codex grants whoever attunes to it enormous power. Before the players ever encounter a codex in the hands of a formidable enemy or sealed away for protection, you should make sure they have some idea what these books can do. Many of these abilities are dramatic and even over-the-top, but not wholly useful in most adventure scenarios. Even still, it becomes unfair, even unsportsmanlike, to surprise your players by making them the target of one of these abilities without warning them what the codices can do first.": "每一本法典都赋予了任何调谐它的人巨大的力量。在玩家们遇到一本法典被强大的敌人所使用，或者被封印以保护之前，你应该确保他们对这些书籍的能力有一定了解。许多这些能力都是戏剧性的，甚至有些过分夸张，但在大多数冒险情景中并不完全有用。即便如此，如果在未提前警告玩家这些法典的能力之前，突然让他们成为这些能力的目标，那就变得不公平，甚至不够体育精神。",
	"These warnings could be presented as in-game knowledge conferred by an NPC or discovered through the heroes' own research.": "这些警告可以被呈现为游戏内NPC传授的知识，或者由英雄们自己的研究发现。",
	"{@i Example: If you attempt to read the mind of a character attuned to the {@item astral codex|KaW}, your head explodes. No saving throw. In one sense, this is an enormously powerful ability and conveys the severe stakes at hand. But the players should know before they encounter an NPC attuned to the Book of Stars that anyone who wields it has learned the mind mastery technique of the star elves, and what this means. It doesn't need to be specific: \"Their minds can't be read. Anyone who attempts it winds up with their brain scrambled ...or worse!\" When the heroes are forewarned, this alarming ability is much less ridiculous and startling and much more dramatic and foreboding.}": "{@i Example: If you attempt to read the mind of a character attuned to the {@item astral codex|KaW}, 你的头爆炸了。没有豁免扔。在某种意义上，这是一种极其强大的能力，表明了手头的严重风险。但玩家们在遇到与《星之书》相调和的NPC之前应该知道，任何挥舞它的人都已经学会了星精灵的心灵掌控技术，以及这意味着什么。不需要具体说明：\"他们的思维无法被读取。任何试图这样做的人最终都会脑袋混乱...或者更糟！\"当英雄们得到预警时，这种令人震惊的能力就不那么荒谬和惊人，而更加戏剧性和不祥。",

	"Once attuned, the owner of the codex need not take the book with them. They can leave it in a secure location with no limits to distance, but must refresh their knowledge through 8 hours of uninterrupted study once per month or lose its benefits.": "一旦调谐，法典的所有者就无需随身携带这本书。他们可以将其留在一个安全的地方，距离没有限制，但必须每月进行8小时的不间断学习，以保持知识的更新，否则将失去其益处。",
	"Some of these books require the attuned owner to surrender some of their life essence to satiate the fell powers constrained or described in the texts. Sacrificing requires rolling some number of Hit Dice, losing that many hit points and the Hit Dice immediately, and reducing your hit point maximum by the same amount. While the effect powered by the sacrifice persists, the lost hit points and Hit Dice can't be regained. When the effect ends, you can heal the damage, restore your hit point maximum to normal, and recover the Hit Dice normally.": "一些这些书籍需要被调谐的主人献出一些他们的生命精华来满足书中所约束或描述的邪恶力量。献祭需要投掷一些数量的生命骰，失去同样数量的生命值和生命骰，并立即减少你的生命值上限相同的数值。虽然牺牲所激发的效果持续存在，但失去的生命值和生命骰无法恢复。当效果结束时，你可以治愈伤害，将生命值上限恢复正常，并正常恢复生命骰。",
