The teachings of the dragons (and of Ojutai in particular) are seen as the pinnacle of attainable wisdom and the entire clan is structured around gaining enlightenment from the Great Teacher himself. Leadership among the humanoids is earned by martial prowess and spiritual teaching rather than by heredity. Each humanoid member of the Ojutai holds both a martial rank and an academic rank. Any given individual may pursue either or both, and the two exist in parallel.
