	"Shardminds are immortal, and thus don't die from old age.": "碎晶心灵是不朽的，因此不会因为年老而死亡。",
	"A Shardmind's alignment depends on what philosophy they follow: Thought Builders are typically good-aligned, God Shards are usually neutral and Shard Slayers are often evil-aligned.": "碎片心灵（Shardmind）的取向取决于他们遵循的哲学：思维建造者（Thought Builders）通常是善良取向，神碎片（God Shards）通常是中立取向，碎片杀手（Shard Slayers）通常是邪恶取向。",
	"Shardminds are around 6 feet tall and weigh between 180 and 240 pounds. Your size is Medium.": "碎晶族大约有6英尺高，体重在180到240磅之间。你的体型为中等。",
	"You have resistance to psychic damage; additionally you have proficiency in the {@skill Arcana} skill.": "你对精神伤害具有抗性；此外，你精通{@skill Arcana}技能。",
	"You have resistance to poison damage and immunity to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being {@condition paralyzed} or {@condition poisoned}. You don't need to eat, drink, breathe or sleep.": "你对毒性伤害具有抗性，对疾病免疫，并且在豁免对抗被{@condition paralyzed}或{@condition poisoned}时具有优势。你无需进食、饮水、呼吸或睡眠。",
	"You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathy, but it must be able to understand at least one language. This process of communication is slow and limited, allowing you to transmit and receive only simple ideas and straightforward concepts.": "你可以以心灵感应的方式与你在30英尺内能看到的任何生物交流。你不需要与这个生物分享一种语言，它就能理解你的心灵感应，但它必须能理解至少一种语言。这种交流过程是缓慢且有限的，只能传递和接收简单的想法和直接的概念。",
	"You loosen your mental grip on your physical form, distracting your foes with a swarm of shards, before re-forming elsewhere. As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you. You have advantage on your first attack roll before the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.": "你放松对你身体形态的精神控制，用一群碎片分散你的敌人的注意力，然后在别处重新形成。作为一个动作，你可以传送到你附近15英尺范围内的一个空位。在你的下一个回合结束前，你的第一次攻击投掷获得优势。一旦你使用了这个特性，你必须完成一次长休才能再次使用。",
	"You can speak, read, and write Common and Deep Speech.": "你可以说、读、写普通语(Common)和深语(Deep Speech)。",
	"Shardminds are sentient fragments of the Living Gate, which once stood at the pinnacle of the intricate lattice of the Astral Sea. Beyond the gate lay the alien Far Realm, and the gate's destruction during the Dawn War resulted in the rise of the mind flayer empire. Though Ioun's power holds the portal closed, shardminds seek to rebuild the gate and forever cut off the Far Realm's ability to influence the world. ": "碎智体是活门的知性碎片，曾经屹立在星界的错综复杂之处。门后是外域异界，黎明战争期间门的毁灭导致了虫人帝国的崛起。尽管艾恩的力量将传送门关闭，碎智体仍然试图重建门，永远切断外域对世界的影响。",
	"Shardminds are crystalline creatures consisting of hundreds of small shards of translucent green, white, red, or amber crystal assembled into humanoid form and animated by a force of pure psionic energy. Shardminds choose their forms to mimic the shapes of humanoids; some take on forms that seem more masculine, while others appear more feminine. A shardmind's animating force glows dimly from within each ofits component shards, emanating most brightly from where the eyes of a natural humanoid would be. This inner light sheds dim light in a shardmind's space, but a shard mind individual can squelch the light with an instant's concentration-in order to hide in the dark, for example.": "碎智者是由数百块半透明的绿色、白色、红色或琥珀色水晶组成的晶体生物，它们被纯粹的灵能力量组装成人形并赋予生命。碎智者选择他们的形态来模仿人形的外形；一些采取看起来更男性化的形态，而另一些则显得更女性化。碎智者的生命力从每个组成水晶块内部微弱地发光，最亮的地方是一个自然人类的眼睛所在的位置。这种内在的光在碎智者的空间中投射出微弱的光芒，但碎智者可以通过瞬间的专注来抑制这种光芒，比如为了在黑暗中隐藏。",
	"The crystalline fragments making up a shardmind's body are in constant, silent motion, almost like the circulation of blood. When a shardmind is stunned or unconscious, it might lose control of the tight mental reins that keep its body in humanoid form, a few shards slipping free into orbits around its body until the shardmind regains control.": "晶片构成的碎片心智体在不断地、无声地运动，几乎像血液循环一样。当一个碎片心智体被震慑或失去意识时，它可能会失去紧密的精神控制，使其身体无法保持人形，一些碎片会脱离并绕着它的身体运转，直到碎片心智体重新掌控。",
	"Shardminds are living creatures only in the loosest sense. Their crystalline bodies require no sustenance, and they don't breathe. They don't need sleep, though they must still rest for six hours to gain the benefits of an extended rest. They don't have gender and don't reproduce, but the shardminds alive today aren't the same ones that sprang to life during the Dawn War. Shardminds say that the Living Gate shattered into countless fragments, and each time an awakened shardmind is killed, another one somewhere in the universe stirs to consciousness.": "碎智体在最宽泛的意义上只能算是活物。它们的晶体身体不需要营养，也不呼吸。它们不需要睡眠，尽管它们仍需休息六小时以获得长时间休息的益处。它们没有性别，也不繁殖，但今天活着的碎智体并非黎明战争期间诞生的那些。碎智体说生命之门已经破碎成无数碎片，每当一个觉醒的碎智体被杀死，宇宙中的另一个某处的碎智体就会苏醒到意识中。",
	"Shardminds are fragments of pure thought given life and substance. They are logical, emotionally distant, and naive to the ways of society in the world. Some approach life with innocent curiosity, eager to embrace the wealth of experiences the world has to offer, while others remain reserved and aloof, bearing a higher purpose in mind at all times. Though they often seem dispassionate, when a strong emotion seizes them, they experience it powerfully. For example, shardminds don't get annoyed; they become enraged.": "碎智体是纯粹思想的碎片赋予了生命和实体。它们逻辑严谨，情感疏远，并对世界社会的方式幼稚无知。有些以天真好奇的态度面对生活，渴望拥抱世界所提供的丰富经历，而另一些则保持矜持和冷漠，时刻心怀更高的目的。虽然它们常常显得冷漠，但一旦被强烈情感抓住，它们会强烈地体验到。例如，碎智体不会感到烦恼；它们会变得愤怒。",
	"Although the race as a whole shares a common goal of rebuilding the Living Gate, several philosophies disagree on how to accomplish that goal. The three most important sects are the Thought Builders, the God Shards, and the Shard Slayers. See below for more information about each philosophy.": "尽管整个种族都共同追求重建生命之门的目标，但有几种哲学派别对如何实现这一目标存在分歧。其中三个最重要的派别分别是思想建造者（Thought Builders）、神碎片（God Shards）和碎片杀手（Shard Slayers）。有关每种哲学派别的更多信息请参见下文。",
	"Thought Builders seek to create a new Living Gate and to imbue it with the psionic power necessary to keep the influence of the Far Realm at bay. The sect is prominent in the planar metropolis of Hestavar. Most members of the Thought Builders are dedicated to Ioun. They tend to be neutral or good.": "思想建筑者（Thought Builders）寻求创建一个新的生命之门，并赋予它心灵力量，以保持远境（Far Realm）的影响。该教派在位于位面都市赫斯塔瓦（Hestavar）中很显著。大多数思想建筑者的成员都致力于依恩（Ioun）。他们往往是中立或善良的。",
	"God Shards believe that each shardmind must seek to acquire as much personal power as possible. Since they are a fragment of the Living Gate, they believe their own power is the force that keeps the Far Realm from destroying the universe; believing each shardmind, in fact, is a fragment of divine power and carries a responsibility to nurture that power. Most God Shards are neutral and revere no deity. ": "神碎片们相信每个碎片心灵都必须尽可能地获取个人力量。由于他们是生命之门的一部分，他们相信自己的力量是阻止远境摧毁宇宙的力量；实际上，他们相信每个碎片心灵都是神圣力量的一部分，并肩负着培育这种力量的责任。大多数神碎片是中立的，不崇拜任何神明。",
	"Shard Slayers believe that when a shardmind dies, its animating life force returns to the site of the Living Gate, where it shores up the universe's defenses against the Far Realm's intrusion. Thus, they seek to kill as many shardminds as possible, starting with the adherents of other philosophies. As a precautionary measure, they also seek out fragments of the Living Gate that have not yet awakened to sentience, and destroy them as well, hoping to reduce the number of shardminds that will exist in the future. Most Shard Slayers are evil, and many are devoted to Vecna.": "碎片杀手相信，当一个碎片心灵死去时，它的生命力量会返回到生命之门的地点，用以加强宇宙对远境入侵的防御。因此，他们试图尽可能杀死更多的碎片心灵，首先从其他哲学信仰的信徒开始。作为预防措施，他们还寻找那些尚未觉醒为有意识的生命之门碎片，并将其摧毁，希望减少未来存在的碎片心灵数量。大多数碎片杀手都是邪恶的，许多人都致力于维克纳（Vecna）。"
