	"Mogogols are essentially overgrown frogs that managed to learn to speak, walk upright, and wear clothes. It is immediately apparent to anyone visiting a mogogol village that there really is no standard look for a mogogol, except that they are frog-like. The clan has amazing physical diversity, which has proven an enigma to sages who study the mogogols. A mogogol's form can be patterned after tree frogs, toads, bullfrogs, and can have just about any sort of coloring, spots, stripes, bumps, or superficial differences that make each individual a little different from the other. Mogogols also differ in size greatly when compared with other races. This is likely due to their ancestral mingling with a plethora of humanoid frog species, some of which that were Small-sized. Mogogols have no prejudice related to height, and treat all members equally. About seven out of every ten mogogols grow to be Medium-sized. Players choose the size of their character at the time of creation. Despite their prolific variety, mogogols do have a few things in common. All mogogols have three fingers and one thumb on each hand. Their clawed, webbed feet enable them to be excellent swimmers. They have extremely muscular legs, which aid in swimming and jumping. Small mogogols can utilize their disproportionately long limbs, finger pads and light weight to climb extremely well.": "莫戈戈尔人实际上是长得像青蛙的巨大青蛙，他们学会了说话、直立行走和穿衣服。任何到访莫戈戈尔村庄的人都会立刻发现，莫戈戈尔没有标准的外观，除了它们长得像青蛙。这个族群有着惊人的身体多样性，这对研究莫戈戈尔的贤者们来说是个谜。莫戈戈尔的形态可以模仿树蛙、蟾蜍、牛蛙，可以有各种颜色、斑点、条纹、疙瘩或其他使每个个体与其他个体略有不同的表面差异。与其他种族相比，莫戈戈尔在体型上也有很大的差异。这可能是因为他们的祖先与众多小型蛙类物种混合繁衍。莫戈戈尔对身高没有偏见，平等对待所有成员。大约十个莫戈戈尔中就有七个长到中等大小。玩家在创造角色时可以选择角色的大小。尽管莫戈戈尔种类繁多，但他们也有一些共同点。所有莫戈戈尔都有每只手三根手指和一根拇指。他们有爪子和蹼的脚让他们成为出色的游泳者。他们有非常有力的腿，有助于游泳和跳跃。小型莫戈戈尔可以利用他们不成比例的长臂、指尖和轻盈的体重爬得非常好。",
	"The mogogols began as an offshoot group of boggards (frog people) who were driven from their swampy homes by another group of boggards. Also around this time, the offshoot group underwent an unexplained change, possibly magical in nature, which caused them to be more open and tolerant of outsiders and practically incapable of intentionally committing an evil act. The group eventually settled in and near saltwater marshes along the coasts and over time their forced contact with outsiders prompted them to take up a seafaring lifestyle. While not as skilled at seafaring as other races, mogogols have made their livings transporting cargo and fishing. The greater exposure to the outside world has also resulted in more genetic diversity, producing a stronger and healthier race. The mogogols of today have only a few common characteristics with their more inbred boggard cousins.": "莫戈戈尔族（蛙人）最初是波加德（蛙人）的一个分支群体，被另一群波加德族驱逐出他们的沼泽家园。大约在这个时候，这个分支群体经历了一种无法解释的变化，可能是魔法性质的，导致他们更加开放和容忍外来者，几乎无法故意犯下邪恶行为。该群体最终定居在靠近海岸的盐水沼泽地区，随着时间的推移，他们与外界的迫使接触促使他们采取了航海生活方式。虽然在航海方面不如其他种族熟练，莫戈戈尔族通过运输货物和捕鱼谋生。与外界更多的接触也导致了更多的基因多样性，产生了更强壮、更健康的种族。如今的莫戈戈尔族与他们更为近亲的波加德族表现出了少数共同特征。",
	"Male and female mogogols are virtually identical in appearance, and gender has little meaning for the species. Additionally, if the population has a shortage on one gender, the older members of the tribe automatically transform into the gender that is needed. The reproductive system of the mogogol is highly adaptive. Occasionally, mogogols will be born with no reproductive facilities at all (and therefore no gender.) This is a permanent condition. Mogogols hatch from eggs the size of golf balls. These eggs are soft and have a jelly-like consistency, and must stay underwater to remain viable. Mogogols start out as larger— though normal looking— tadpoles, and are unable to breathe air or move on land until they are 3 years old. At that point, they begin looking less like a tadpole and more like a miniature mogogol, with a tail and tiny underdeveloped arms. By age 6, they look like normal, albeit small (2-3 feet tall) mogogols. At this age they are able to learn skills and speech. By age 12, a mogogol is sexually mature. They tend to reach old age at about 45, aging a bit quicker than humans. Mogogols often form small communities on the edge of swamps. This has less to do with preference, as mogogols do have diverse tastes in living environments, and more to do with affordability and biological needs. Some speculate that the mogogol ancestors strayed too close to chaos magic, or that the eggs were hatched in brambleberry wine. Whatever the cause, the mogogols think differently than the average PC race. All mogogols seem to have an impeccable sense of right and wrong, and are compelled to avoid the wrong. Their warped altruistic nature leads them away from the dismal swamps and into civilized areas. In addition, mogogols are prone to wild obsessions that they tend to pursue their entire lives. A young mogogol who becomes fascinated with ships, for example, is very likely to devote his entire life to them, becoming a ship builder or captain. It is hard to predict exactly what will catch a mogogol's eye, but when it does, little can be done to steer the creature away from the new obsession. When playing a mogogol, one must remember that they are indelibly good and optimistic. It's not a choice, it's a virtual curse. A particularly downtrodden mogogol will still seem upbeat, though his mania may be particularly acute at this time as well. Performing an evil act makes a mogogol physically ill, and they learn early to avoid it if at all possible. Some sages believe the strange mogogol behavior to be the result of a magical curse, although no style of divination has yet been able to prove that the mogogols have any magical taint. Others believe it to be the result of some sort of neurological disease that only infects intelligent amphibians. However, this theory is also shot down, as no magical or mundane methods to cure disease or remove poison has altered a mogogol's personality in any way. Whatever the cause, mogogols are here to stay. They will venture from their dismal marshes in search of good deeds and a worthy title. Other amphibian races have come to fear and loath the mogogols. Adding to the validity of the disease theory, normal boggards usually flee rather than face a mogogol, for fear they too will succumb to the 'curse of altruism'. A boggard's worst imaginable fate is to be forever doomed to help old ladies across busy streets, defend the helpless, and be generally optimistic and nice.": "雌雄莫戈戈尔在外表上几乎没有区别，性别对这个物种来说意义不大。此外，如果一个性别的族群短缺，部落中年长成员会自动转变成需要的性别。莫戈戈尔的生殖系统非常适应性强。偶尔会有莫戈戈尔出生时没有任何生殖器官（因此没有性别）。这是一个永久的状态。莫戈戈尔从高尔夫球大小的蛋中孵化而出。这些蛋是软的，有着果冻般的质地，必须保持在水下才能保持生存能力。莫戈戈尔一开始是较大的——尽管看起来正常——蝌蚪，直到3岁时才能呼吸空气或在陆地上移动。那时，它们开始看起来不那么像蝌蚪，更像是迷你版的莫戈戈尔，有着尾巴和微小的未发育的手臂。到了6岁，它们看起来像正常的，尽管身材较小（2-3英尺高）的莫戈戈尔。在这个年龄，它们能够学习技能和语言。到了12岁，莫戈戈尔就性成熟了。它们通常在约45岁时变老，比人类老得稍快一些。莫戈戈尔经常在沼泽边形成小社区。这与偏好关系不大，因为莫戈戈尔对生活环境有着多样的口味，更多地是出于经济承受能力和生物需求。一些人推测莫戈戈尔的祖先可能误入了混沌魔法，或是蛋是在荆棘莓酒中孵化的。无论原因是什么，莫戈戈尔的思维方式与普通的PC种族不同。所有莫戈戈尔似乎都有着无可挑剔的是非感，被迫避开错误。他们扭曲的利他主义天性让他们远离阴暗的沼泽，走向文明地区。此外，莫戈戈尔容易陷入他们一生追求的狂热。比如，一个年轻的莫戈戈尔如果对船只着迷，很可能会将他的整个生命奉献给船只，成为造船工或船长。很难准确预测什么会引起莫戈戈尔的兴趣，但一旦引起，几乎无法阻止这个生物远离新的狂热。玩莫戈戈尔时，必须记住它们是无可动摇的善良和乐观。这不是选择，而是一种虚拟的诅咒。即使是一个特别沮丧的莫戈戈尔看起来仍然乐观，尽管他的狂热在这个时候可能尤为严重。做出邪恶行为会让莫戈戈尔身体不适，他们很早就学会尽量避免这种行为。一些智者认为莫戈戈尔奇怪的行为是一种魔法诅咒的结果，尽管迄今为止还没有任何占卜方式能证明莫戈戈尔带有任何魔法污染。其他人认为这是某种只感染智能两栖动物的神经疾病的结果。然而，这个理论也被否定了，因为没有任何魔法或世俗方法能够治愈疾病或清除毒素，从而以任何方式改变莫戈戈尔的个性。无论原因是什么，莫戈戈尔都会留下来。他们将离开阴暗的沼泽，寻找善行和一个值得的头衔。其他两栖动物种族已经开始害怕和憎恶莫戈戈尔。为了证实疾病理论的有效性，通常正常的泥蛙通常会逃跑而不是面对莫戈戈尔，因为他们害怕自己也会受到“利他主义的诅咒”。泥蛙最糟糕的命运是永远被注定帮助老太太过马路，保护无助者，并且总是乐观和友善。",
	"Mogogols have three important naming practices. The first, and most confusing tradition, is that all mogogols are named Mogogol. The second, whose name is probably a corruption of the word \"epitaph\" (and an unfortunate one at that), is the ever-so-common \"epitab\". An epitab, as the mogogols describe it, are words that people tack onto the end of your name. So one would know one mogogol from another by calling one \"Mogogol with the green spots\" or \"Mogogol who broke his leg\". The epitab carries with it no honor, and its use generally denotes a mogogol who has not yet succeeded at anything worthwhile. All of the noteworthy mogogols have a title, which to the race, just means that someone decided to tack on a noteworthy prefix to their name rather than a suffix. Nearly all mogogols are guaranteed the title of Father or Mother if they have children, and Grandfather or Grandmother if they live to see their children have children. But the more prestigious titles are ones earned from another race. Among the most memorable of these are Captain Mogogol, Friar Mogogol, Doctor Mogogol, and Dread Pirate Mogogol. Generally mogogols make no distinction between male and female (in fact, the title of Father and Mother is often awarded incorrectly).": "莫戈戈尔人有三种重要的命名惯例。第一种，也是最令人困惑的传统，就是所有莫戈戈尔人都被命名为莫戈戈尔。第二种，名字可能是“墓志铭”一词的变形（而且不幸的是），是非常常见的“墓志”。莫戈戈尔人描述墓志为人们附加在名字末尾的词语。因此，人们可以通过称呼“有绿斑点的莫戈戈尔”或“摔断腿的莫戈戈尔”来区分不同的莫戈戈尔人。墓志并不带有荣誉，通常意味着一个莫戈戈尔人尚未取得任何值得称赞的成就。所有值得注意的莫戈戈尔人都有一个头衔，对这个种族来说，这只意味着有人决定在他们的名字前加上一个显著的前缀，而不是后缀。几乎所有莫戈戈尔人如果有孩子，都会被保证获得父亲或母亲的头衔，如果他们活到看到孩子有孩子，就会成为祖父或祖母。但更负盛名的头衔是从另一个种族那里获得的。其中最令人难忘的有船长莫戈戈尔、修士莫戈戈尔、医生莫戈戈尔和可怕的海盗莫戈戈尔。一般来说，莫戈戈尔人不区分男性和女性（事实上，父亲和母亲的头衔经常被错误授予）。"
