	"Sangheili are physically imposing beings, typically standing more than a foot taller than the average human. They are vaguely reptilian in overall appearance, with leathery skin, digitigrade legs and sharp claws and teeth. Their large hands have two fingers and two thumbs. Their most distinguishing trait is their jaw structure, which is made up of four separate mandibles attached to their face. Sangheili are muscular and very tall, standing between 7 and 8, though they often seem slightly shorter due to their usual hunched position, but the style of armor they typically wear makes them appear more hunched than they actually are.": "桑海利族（Sangheili）是身材高大的生物，通常比普通人高出一英尺以上。他们整体外观略带爬行动物的特征，皮肤粗糙，脚趾弯曲，有锋利的爪子和牙齿。他们的大手有两根手指和两个拇指。他们最显著的特征是下颚结构，由四个独立的下颚组成并连接到脸上。桑海利族肌肉发达，身材高大，身高在7到8英尺之间，尽管他们通常因为习惯的驼背姿势而显得略矮一些，但他们通常穿着的盔甲风格使他们看起来比实际身高更驼背。",
	"Their jaws are quadruple-hinged, with an upper jaw and four lower mandibles arranged in two tiers. These mandibles have between six and twelve teeth each and some Sangheili have an additional, larger fang on the tips of each mandible. Adult Sangheili mandibles can be found in varying shapes, sizes, and ranges of dexterity, and are as distinctive as a human fingerprint.": "它们的下颚是四重铰链的，有一个上颚和四个排列在两层的下颚。这些下颚每个有六到十二颗牙齿，一些(`Sangheili`)(`Sangheili`)在每个下颚的尖端还有一个额外的更大的尖牙。成年(`Sangheili`)的下颚可以有不同形状、大小和灵巧程度，和人类的指纹一样独特。",
	"Their hands are tetradactyl, each having two fingers in the middle and an opposing thumb on either side. Their legs are digitigrade, with short upper and lower legs, and elongated tarsals, using the distal and intermediate phalanges to support their weight when walking. This arrangement allows them to run very quickly and jump large distances, compared to other races.": "他们的手是四趾的，每只手中间有两根手指，两侧各有一个对立的拇指。他们的腿是趾行的，上下腿短，跗骨延长，使用远端和中间指骨支撑体重行走。这种结构使他们能够比其他种族跑得非常快，跳跃的距离也更远。",
	"Sangheili have a binary circulatory system that pumps indigo-colored blood and have a double set of pectoral muscles, which contributes to their incredible strength. Most Sangheili have leathery skin covered in some parts by scales and their skin color can range from light brown to dark brown, light gray to black, and blue. They have forward-facing eyes with vertical slits and horizontal eyelids much like those of reptiles, and their eyes can have multiple colours ranging from red all the way to green and can be even gray; however most Sangheili possess yellow or orange eyes.": "桑海利人拥有一个二进制循环系统，泵送靛蓝色的血液，并拥有一对胸肌，这使得他们拥有惊人的力量。大多数桑海利人有覆盖部分鳞片的皮革般的皮肤，皮肤颜色可以从浅褐色到深褐色，从浅灰色到黑色，再到蓝色。他们有向前的眼睛，带有垂直瞳孔和水平眼睑，很像爬行动物的眼睛，他们的眼睛可以有多种颜色，从红色到绿色，甚至可以是灰色；然而大多数桑海利人的眼睛是黄色或橙色。",
	"Although Sangheili are naturally very intelligent, their culture's long dependence on a military tradition has led to an emphasis on might over study. Despite their warrior culture being the most well-known, the Sangheili actually have almost innumerable roles within their society, from political entities like kaidons and keep elders all the way to the more technical artificers and farmers.": "尽管圣战士(Sangheili)天生聪明，但他们的文化长期依赖军事传统，导致更加强调武力胜过学识。尽管他们以战士文化最为著名，但实际上在他们的社会中，圣战士拥有几乎无数的角色，从政治实体如凯顿(kaidons)和守护长老一直到更为技术性的工匠和农民。",
	"Raised from childhood to be warriors, other societal roles are treated as secondary endeavors or even hobbies. Doctors are considered outright dishonorable as they \"spill blood\" outside the battlefield as such few doctors exist within Sangheili society, and Sangheili hold disdain for using medicine to treat themselves and some personally would rather suffer through their injuries or die.": "从小就被培养成为战士，其他社会角色被视为次要职业，甚至是爱好。医生被认为是彻头彻尾的不光彩，因为他们在战场之外“流血”，所以在桑吉利社会中几乎没有医生存在，桑吉利人鄙视使用药物来治疗自己，有些人宁愿忍受伤痛或者死去。",
	"Sangheili are trained to be skilled in most ranged weapons, as well as hand-to-hand combat. A prominent example of this martial focus is that only aristocrats are allowed to wield swords and that sword-wielders are then no longer eligible for marriage; however, they may breed with any female they choose, married or otherwise, to ensure successful transmission of \"swordsman\" genes. Many Sangheili children are trained in basic swordsmanship early on, both for personal development and for them to be capable of using a sword later in life if necessary. Within the military, an aristocratic title is not necessary for wielding a sword. Military promotion among the Sangheili is by merit. A Sangheili soldier must succeed to advance among the ranks, with this success being measured in combat kills. A Sangheili near the top of the military hierarchy may have personally slaughtered thousands of individuals to reach that status.": "桑海利族人接受训练，精通大多数远程武器，以及近身格斗。这种武术专注的一个显著例子是，只有贵族才被允许挥舞剑，而挥舞剑的人则不再有资格结婚；然而，他们可以与任何他们选择的女性繁殖，无论是否已婚，以确保“剑客”基因的成功传递。许多桑海利族儿童在早期接受基本剑术训练，既是为了个人发展，也是为了他们在日后必要时能够使用剑。在军队中，贵族头衔对挥舞剑并非必要。桑海利族人之间的军事晋升是凭借功绩。桑海利族士兵必须在军衔中取得成功，这种成功是通过战斗杀敌来衡量的。一个在军事等级制度顶端附近的桑海利族人可能亲手屠杀了成千上万的个体才能达到那个地位。",
	"Historically the Sangheili have considered most other species to be inferior to them, both culturally and in fighting skill; this thinking has caused Sangheili to treat other species cruelly and in an arrogant manner.": "历史上，圣战士(Sangheili)认为大多数其他物种在文化和战斗技能上都不如他们；这种想法导致圣战士以残忍和傲慢的方式对待其他物种。",
	"The Sangheili display respect and admiration for honorable fighters, whether they are allies of the Sangheili or not; it is not unusual for the Sangheili to have such an admiration for their adversaries. Sangheili respect and revere veterans and often follow their lead. Their history is rife with victorious combatants welcoming the defeated enemies' remaining forces into their own army, provided of course that they fought with honor.": "Sangheili（Sangheili）对尊贵的战士表现出尊重和钦佩，无论他们是Sangheili的盟友还是其他人；Sangheili对他们的对手有这样的钦佩并不罕见。Sangheili尊重和崇敬退伍军人，并经常跟随他们的领导。他们的历史充满了战胜者欢迎被打败的敌人余部加入自己军队的例子，当然前提是他们以荣誉战斗。",
	"Despite their intelligence, the Sangheili often allow their obsession with honor to cloud their better judgement. The Sangheili usually employ complex strategy only if it either improves success in battle, allows them to inflict more casualties on their enemies, or if it conforms to their code of honor. Otherwise, in both tactical and strategic combat, Sangheili generally charge their enemies with reckless aggression, regardless of any damage they sustain. Only very seldom do they admit temporary defeat.": "尽管他们聪明，但圣战士(Sangheili)经常让对荣誉的执着蒙蔽了他们更好的判断力。圣战士通常只会采用复杂的战略，如果这能提高在战斗中的成功率，让他们对敌人造成更多伤亡，或者符合他们的荣誉准则。否则，在战术和战略战斗中，圣战士通常会以鲁莽的攻势冲向敌人，不顾他们受到的任何伤害。他们很少承认暂时的失败。",
	"Conversely, those who favor practicality over religious fervor in combat exhibit keen tactical and strategic acumen. The Zealots, despite being among the most fervent adherents of their religion, use shrewd, pragmatic tactics and are willing to engage in subterfuge in lieu of open combat.": "相反地，那些在战斗中更看重实用性而非宗教狂热的人展现出敏锐的战术和战略头脑。狂热信徒中的狂热者，尽管是他们宗教中最热诚的追随者之一，却使用精明、务实的战术，并愿意通过诡计来取代公开战斗。",
	"The Sangheili honor code is similar to a few throughout human history, sharing concepts such as skill in combat (with an emphasis on swordsmanship), loyalty to master and family/clan, and views on death. Some such systems promote death in battle as being the most honorable and proper way to die. If a warrior is critically injured, incapacitated, or captured, the only acceptable recourse is to commit ritualistic suicide, ensuring one's honor is kept intact. This is of such importance to Sangheili warriors that even if they are incapable of killing themselves, they may request the assistance of their fellow Sangheili in doing so. The Sangheili consider being captured in combat to be dishonorable. To retain his honor, a valiant Sangheili would typically commit suicide while in prison. Often when imprisoned Sangheili are freed those who have not killed themselves are executed anyway, however, escaping or staging an uprising is considered acceptable.": "Sangheili（Elite）的荣誉准则与人类历史上的一些相似，共享诸如战斗技能（强调剑术）、对主人和家族/氏族的忠诚以及对死亡的看法等概念。一些这样的体系认为，在战斗中死去是最光荣和合适的死法。如果一个战士受到重伤、无法行动或被俘，唯一可接受的手段是进行仪式性自杀，确保自己的荣誉得以保持完整。对Sangheili战士来说，这一点至关重要，即使他们无法自杀，也可以请求其他Sangheili的帮助。Sangheili认为在战斗中被俘是不光彩的。为了保持荣誉，一名英勇的Sangheili通常会在监狱里自杀。通常情况下，被释放的被囚禁的Sangheili中，那些没有自杀的人仍然会被处决，然而，逃跑或发动起义被认为是可以接受的。",
	"Despite their martial nature, the Sangheili have reservations to the spilling of one's own blood. This is an extension of the belief that the blood of a warrior is his essence, which is synonymous with his honor; thus, to spill one's blood is to lose one's honor. As a result, in Sangheili culture, doctors are seen by many as the lowest members of society because they \"make their living slicing and causing another Sangheili to bleed without honor.\" This means that the only 'honorable' way for a Sangheili to be injured or bleed out is from combat with the enemy. This belief also makes visiting a doctor very shameful for some Sangheili.": "尽管桑海利族（Sangheili）具有好战的本性，但他们对自己的血液流出持保留态度。这是对战士血液即其荣誉的信念的延伸；因此，流出自己的血液就等于失去了荣誉。因此，在桑海利文化中，许多人认为医生是社会中地位最低的人，因为他们“以无荣誉地切割和使另一个桑海利族流血为生。” 这意味着桑海利族受伤或流血的唯一“光荣”方式是与敌人战斗。这种信念也使得一些桑海利族前往医生那里治疗感到非常羞耻。",
	"The Sangheili seldom view personal weapons as anything more than tools of war, and rarely attach extra importance to a weapon simply because it once belonged to a great warrior. However, certain historical weapons were so famous that they were said to possess a small part of the owner's heart, and were given names as a result.": "桑海利族很少将个人武器视为除了战争工具外的任何东西，并很少因为一把武器曾经属于一位伟大的战士而给予额外重视。然而，某些历史悠久的武器非常有名，据说它们拥有主人心灵的一小部分，因此被赋予了名字。",
	"Many Sangheili believe that a weapon is to be drawn only if it is to be used, because a drawn weapon \"demands blood.\" However, it appears that the user's intention when it is being drawn matters more than the weapon actually being used.": "许多桑格利利人相信，武器只有在使用时才应该拔出，因为拔出武器“必然要有鲜血流出”。然而，似乎使用者拔出武器时的意图比实际使用武器更重要。",
	"As a symbolic gesture of love for his people, a Sangheili leader may choose to walk among his followers and help them in their duties, even doing what is normally considered females' work such as helping them care for eggs. This is also done to inspire the Sangheili to work diligently so as to not be outdone by their superiors.": "作为对他的人民的爱的象征性姿态，一位圣战士领袖可能选择走在他的追随者中间，并帮助他们完成任务，甚至做一些通常被认为是女性工作的事情，比如帮助他们照料蛋。这也是为了激励圣战士努力工作，以免被他们的上级超越。",
	"In warfare, the Sangheili uphold a martial tradition known as {@i Shrwssha'wash}; a ritual dismemberment of defeated foes, most commonly manifested by the displaying of the enemy's skull as a trophy.": "在战争中，圣战士遵守一种称为{@i Shrwssha'wash}的武士传统；即对被打败的敌人进行仪式性肢解，最常见的表现是将敌人的头骨作为战利品展示出来。",
	"The Sangheili often have no unified government; typically they are splintered into numerous feudal, meritocratic city-states. A given state is governed by a single clan residence and assembly house known as a keep, headed by a kaidon selected by a council of elders. There are usually a number of \"client keeps\" belonging to different clans under the leading keep's rule, though a state's elders will assume the kaidon's clan name as a title signifying their position, regardless of the name of their own family keep.": "Sangheili（(Sangheili)）通常没有统一的政府；通常他们分裂成许多封建、精英主义的城邦。一个州由一个被称为要塞的单一氏族住所和议会大厦统治，由一群长老选出的kaidon领导。通常有许多属于不同氏族的“附属要塞”属于主要要塞的统治，尽管一个州的长老们会以一个头衔来表示他们的职位，而不管他们自己家族要塞的名字。",
	"In Sangheili culture, it is customary to settle disagreements with authority by assassination, though one has to use personal weapons in order for the practice to be considered honorable. For example, if a council elder believes that his vote was ill-advised or had second thoughts, it is considered a tradition for council elders to initiate some form of attack, such as sending assassins, against the kaidon in order \"...to test the true merit of the ruler's martial abilities.\" The belief was that \"a kaidon who could not defend himself was not a true leader.\" Should the attack fail, the responsible elder will be executed immediately, and his family will be killed. However, punishment for this form of failure was usually flexible. As such, if the elder did something honorable, such as attack the kaidon himself, or attempted to make a final stand against the kaidon, then he would probably have managed to save his family from certain death, although they might still be banished.": "在桑海利文化中，习俗上是通过刺杀来解决与权威的分歧，尽管为了被认为是光荣的做法，必须使用个人武器。例如，如果议会长老认为他的投票是错误的或后悔了，议会长老发起某种形式的攻击，比如派遣刺客，对凯顿进行攻击被认为是一种传统，目的是\"...测试统治者的真正武术能力。\" 信仰是\"一个不能自卫的凯顿不是真正的领袖。\" 如果攻击失败，负责的长老将立即被处决，他的家人也将被杀害。然而，对于这种失败形式的惩罚通常是灵活的。因此，如果长老做了一些光荣的事情，比如亲自攻击凯顿，或试图对抗凯顿做最后的抵抗，那么他可能成功地挽救了他的家人免于必死的命运，尽管他们可能仍然会被流放。",
	"Family history and lineage are greatly valued, with most families having their own unique \"battle poem\" and \"saga wall\" detailing the deeds and actions of its members during times of war.": "家族史和血统非常重要，大多数家庭都有自己独特的“战斗诗”和“传奇墙”，详细描述了家族成员在战争时期的事迹和行动。",
	"Although Sangheili society is patriarchal, and while most males serve as warriors, female Sangheili hold considerable power in issues within their family keeps, including political matters, civil duties and trade, while Sangheili males are sent into service as warriors. Sangheili females have access to records of their own bloodlines, and are able to choose their mates. The maintaining of a clan's familial records is typically the duty of the wife of the keep elder. The concept of divorce is completely foreign to Sangheili.": "尽管圣战士社会是父权制的，大多数男性担任战士，但女性圣战士在家族事务中拥有相当大的权力，包括政治事务、公民义务和贸易，而男性圣战士则被派遣为战士。女性圣战士可以查阅自己家族血统的记录，并有权选择自己的伴侣。通常，保持家族记录的责任落在守护者长者的妻子身上。离婚的概念对圣战士来说是完全陌生的。",
	"Sangheili warriors form very close-knitted relationships, referring to their comrades as \"brothers\" or \"sisters\" and remaining intensely loyal to them. This loyalty is shown in the custom of grieving after the death of a fallen comrade, a ritual which includes prayer for the dead warrior.": "桑海利战士之间形成非常紧密的关系，称呼他们的同伴为“兄弟”或“姐妹”，并对他们保持极度忠诚。这种忠诚体现在为阵亡同伴哀悼的习俗中，这一仪式包括为逝去的战士祈祷。",
	"Newly hatched Sangheili are called \"childlings\", and as they grow older, they are then referred to as \"younglings\". During the first decade of their lives, Sangheili children have protective scales that hang from their necks, an evolutionary holdover from the days when the Sangheili used to carry their offspring with their toothy mandibles away from danger.": "新孵化的桑海利人被称为\"幼儿\"，随着年龄的增长，他们被称为\"年幼者\"。在他们的生命的第一个十年里，桑海利人的孩子们有一层保护性的鳞片，悬挂在他们的脖子上，这是一种进化遗留物，源自桑海利人过去用他们的有牙齿的下颚将后代带离危险的日子。",
	"Sangheili children are typically raised in the communal environment of their family keep to ensure that all start on an equal footing and progress in rank by merit of their abilities. They are not allowed to know the identity of their true fathers and are usually raised by a maternal uncle instead. This is a method of preventing status from being inherited in order to force children to make their own way in the world so they actively work for and earn advancement, thus minimizing nepotism and promoting loyalty to the whole clan rather than their parents. However, as some children's fathers are swordsmen who have been granted the right to reproduce with any number of female Sangheili they desire, the use of a maternal uncle as a father-like figure is used to allow children to be raised equally. Sometimes the individual acting as a Sangheili's \"uncle\" is in fact the father, but this makes no difference to his role as the child will never know.": "桑海利（Sangheili）的孩子通常在家族要塞的共同环境中长大，以确保所有人都有平等的起点，并通过自己的能力获得晋升。他们不被允许知道自己真正父亲的身份，通常由一个母亲的叔叔来抚养。这是一种防止地位被继承的方法，以迫使孩子们自己在世界上闯出一条路，因此他们会积极工作并通过努力获得晋升，从而最大程度地减少裙带关系，促进对整个家族的忠诚，而不是他们的父母。然而，由于一些孩子的父亲是被授予与任意数量的雌性桑海利繁殖权的剑客，因此使用一个母亲的叔叔作为类似父亲的人物来抚养孩子，以确保孩子们被平等地抚养。有时，扮演桑海利“叔叔”角色的个人实际上是父亲，但这对他的角色没有任何影响，因为孩子永远不会知道。",
	"Both male and female Sangheili are taught to fight from a young age. Though only males go on to become warriors, it is believed that the females should be able to defend themselves in the event their keep is attacked. A popular pastime for Sangheili children is to hunt small creatures that live near their homes; young Sangheili also learn and sing old narrative poems, the most famous and widely known being the legendary ballad of the demigod hero Kel 'Darsam.": "Sangheili（Eilisang）男女都从小就接受战斗训练。尽管只有男性会成为战士，但人们认为女性也应该能在家园受到攻击时自卫。对Sangheili（Eilisang）孩童来说，一个流行的消遣是狩猎家附近的小动物；年轻的Sangheili（Eilisang）也会学习并吟唱古老的叙事诗，其中最著名和广为人知的是半神英雄Kel 'Darsam的传奇歌谣。",
	"The Sangheili language is rather harsh and guttural to untrained ears. While much remains unknown to outsiders about its overall structure and conventions, it is known that certain sounds are largely absent from the Sangheili language due to their unique mouth structure; for example, Sangheili have difficulty pronouncing human words containing the letter \"v\" or ending with \"p\".": "Sangheili（Sangheili）语言对于未经训练的耳朵来说相当粗糙和喉音。 尽管外部人士对其整体结构和惯例仍知之甚少，但已知由于其独特的口腔结构，Sangheili（Sangheili）语言中缺乏某些声音；例如，Sangheili（Sangheili）很难发音包含字母“v”或以“p”结尾的人类单词。",
	"Text, or writing, in Sangheili appears to be mostly triangle shapes and composed almost completely of equilateral triangles. The triangular characters have been seen oriented both in the horizontal left-to-right direction and in a vertical right-to-left direction.": "Sangheili文字或书写似乎主要是三角形状，几乎完全由等边三角形组成。这些三角形字符看起来既可以水平从左到右排列，也可以垂直从右到左排列。",
	"The Sangheili place great value in names and titles, and consider names to be a privilege given only to those who are worthy.": "桑海利人非常重视名字和头衔，并认为名字是只赋予值得的人的特权。",
	"A Sangheili's first name is a given name that is attained at birth and persists throughout their life. After reaching adulthood, they are given a badge name. This was often composed of two core parts: an adjective describing the individual, and a family name; Ado 'Mortumee was one practitioner of this system, where 'Mor' was his personal descriptor, and 'Tum' identified his lineage. Alternatively, some may have their badge name drawn from their State of origin, which could be tied to a specific Keep or family. For example: Thel 'Vadam was from the Vadam lineage. Some lineages, such as Vadam, have control over their own states, although this is not always the case; it is typical for Sangheili of other lineages to occupy smaller keeps in a state named after another lineage. Client keep elders within a given state typically adopt the name of the state instead of using their own family name.": "一名桑凯利人的名字是在出生时获得的名字，一生中保持不变。成年后，他们会获得一个徽章名。这通常由两个核心部分组成：一个形容个体的形容词，和一个姓氏；阿多（Ado）'莫图米（Mortumee）是这一体系的一个实践者，其中'Mor'是他的个人描述词，'Tum'标识了他的血统。另外，有些人可能会从他们的原籍州得到徽章名，这可能与特定的要塞或家族有关。例如：泰尔（Thel）'瓦丹（Vadam）来自瓦丹家族。一些家族，比如瓦丹家族，对自己的州有控制权，尽管情况并非总是如此；其他家族的桑凯利人通常会占据另一个家族命名的州中的较小要塞。在特定州内的客户要塞长老通常会采用州名，而不使用自己的家族姓氏。",
	"Typically, most elites followed either of the previous systems, although they were exceptions. An \"ee\" suffix denotes military service and lengthened names, such as the prefix \"Ika\" (which meant that the Sangheili had been an aide to a hierarch of some sort), gave them higher status among other elites. Additional titles, such as \"Jar\" and \"Nar,\" appear to be related to specific ranks. Apart from the \"-ee\" suffix, the suffix \"-ai\" denotes swordsmanship, as with Bero 'Kusovai and Toha 'Sumai.": "通常，大多数精英都遵循先前的系统之一，尽管也有例外情况。一个“ee”后缀表示军事服务和延长的名字，比如前缀“Ika” (这意味着圣战士曾经是某种等级的侍从)，使他们在其他精英中享有更高的地位。其他头衔，比如“Jar”和“Nar”，似乎与特定的军衔有关。除了“-ee”后缀外，“-ai”后缀表示剑术，就像Bero 'Kusovai和Toha 'Sumai一样。",
	"Some Sangheili have names tied to heroes, battles, and legends that harken back to early Sangheili history. These more ancient family names often retain the idiosyncrasies of a more antiquated Sangheili dialect.": "一些桑海利(Sangheili)的名字与英雄、战役和传说紧密相连，这些名字可以追溯到早期桑海利历史。这些更古老的家族姓氏通常保留着更为古老的桑海利方言的特点。",
	"The apostrophe in front of the clan name indicates a sound resembling a glottal stop or click.": "在氏族名称前的撇号表示一个类似喉塞音或卡嗒音的声音。",
