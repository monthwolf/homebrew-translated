	"The Ancients built their civilizations, reaching heights we cannot even fully imagine now. They spoke to the stars, reshaped the creatures of the world, and mastered form and essence. They built cities and machines that have since crumbled to dust, leaving the barest remnants.": "古代人建立了他们的文明，达到了我们现在甚至无法完全想象的高度。他们与星辰交谈，重塑了世界上的生物，并掌握了形式和本质。他们建造了城市和机器，如今已经化为尘土，只留下了微弱的残余。",
	"These remnants are usually called \"the numenera,\" a term that refers to anything that originates from a cache of Ancients' lore, such as bio-shaped creatures, beings partly replaced with machine-flesh, and creatures brought here from alien worlds and dimensions heretofore unknown. It also includes things that have been indirectly created by the incomprehensible lore of the Ancients—mutants and flesh-shaping accidents, the descendants of experiments, and so on.": "这些遗物通常被称为“遗物能量(numenera)，”这个术语指的是源自古代知识储藏室的任何事物，比如生物形态的生物、部分被机械肉体取代的生物，以及从未知的外星世界和维度带到这里的生物。它还包括那些间接由古代人难以理解的知识创造的事物——突变体和肉体塑形意外、实验后代等等。",
	"Although the comparison between \"magic\" and the numenera is worthwhile, taking it too far is likely a mistake. Yet it's still just as mysterious and strange, mostly because the numenera is varied and unpredictable to those who don't understand it, which is pretty much everyone.": "尽管比较\"魔法\"和第(%num%)纪仍然值得，但过度推论可能是一个错误。然而，它仍然同样神秘和奇怪，主要是因为第(%num%)纪是多样且难以预测的，对于不理解它的人来说，这几乎是所有人。",
	"There are people, however, who {@i attempt} to understand it—at least to some degree. Not everyone lives in terror of it. Some recover numenera from Ancients' caches, study it, comprehend a bit of it, and then use it for their own purposes.": "然而，有些人{@i attempt}至少在某种程度上理解它。并非每个人都生活在恐惧中。有些人从先民的储藏中找回奇物，研究它，理解一些，并将其用于自己的目的。",
	"Player characters may be just such people. Though their hand may be forced by events surrounding the discovery of the Ancients, such as the activation of an Ancients device that could spell doom unless it is at least partially comprehended, then deactivated or channeled in some fashion.": "玩家角色可能就是这样的人。尽管他们的手可能被围绕着远古人的发现而发生的事件所迫，比如激活一个远古装置，除非至少部分理解，然后停用或以某种方式引导，否则可能会带来厄运。",
	"Devices of the Ancients can be categorized as {@filter cyphers|items|source=AotA|type=cypher}, {@filter relics|items|source=AotA|type=relic}, and {@filter iron flesh|items|source=AotA|type=iron flesh}, as well as {@book oddities|AotA|0|Oddities}, {@book mutations|AotA|0|Mutations}, and {@book discoveries|AotA|0|Discoveries}. These categories show how the PCs interact with the numenera—how it is (or isn't) useful to them. When thinking about technology, the GM can also consider origin and appearance. This approach looks at devices not from a game-mechanic standpoint, but from the point of view of people living in the world.": "古代设备可以被归类为{@filter cyphers|items|source=AotA|type=cypher}、{@filter relics|items|source=AotA|type=relic}和{@filter iron flesh|items|source=AotA|type=iron flesh}，以及{@book oddities|AotA|0|Oddities}、{@book mutations|AotA|0|Mutations}和{@book discoveries|AotA|0|Discoveries}。这些类别展示了玩家角色与奇物互动的方式——它对他们是否有用。在考虑技术时，GM也可以考虑起源和外观。这种方法不是从游戏机制的角度来看待设备，而是从生活在这个世界的人的角度来看待。",
	"Sometimes, numenera devices are complex metallic devices. However, their {@book shape and substance can vary wildly|AotA|1|Numenera Device Shapes and Materials}, so much that those unused to Ancients' craft may not even realize that they're interacting with a machine or device, at least not initially.": "有时，奇物装置是复杂的金属装置。然而，它们的{@book shape and substance can vary wildly|AotA|1|Numenera Device Shapes and Materials}，以至于那些不习惯远古文明工艺的人可能甚至不会意识到他们正在与一台机器或装置互动，至少起初不会。",
	"The size of numenera devices is variable, even between instances of the same cypher, relic, or iron flesh. If a size isn't specified in the item description, if it becomes necessary to know, the GM should simply determine how large the sphere, cube, nodule, disc, and so on, as seems reasonable based on the overall description. A {@item astute weapon nodule|AotA|weapon nodule}, for instance, must be small enough to be applied to a weapon in a way that doesn't interfere with the weapon's use.": "奇物设备的尺寸是可变的，即使是相同的密码、遗物或铁肉实例之间也是如此。如果物品描述中没有指定尺寸，如果有必要知道，GM应根据整体描述来确定球体、立方体、小结节、圆盘等的大小，看起来合理即可。例如，{@item astute weapon nodule|AotA|weapon nodule}必须足够小，以便可以应用到武器上而不会干扰武器的使用。",
	"Devices pulled from an ancient ruin might be complete devices found intact, but many are likely portions of another device that can be used for a function all their own. Examples of the former include a bracerlike device with a touch-sensitive activation surface that the wearer can manipulate to create a powerful energy field around them. The latter might be a glass pane taken from a vast machine that by itself allows the user to see through an inch of normal matter.": "从古代遗迹中找到的装置可能是完整的设备，完整地发现，但许多可能只是另一个设备的部分，可以用于独立的功能。前者的例子包括一种类似护腕的设备，带有触摸敏感的激活表面，佩戴者可以操控它来创建一个强大的能量场围绕自己。后者可能是从一台庞大机器中取出的玻璃板，单独使用可以让用户透视一英寸厚的普通物质。",
	"Cyphers, relics, iron flesh, oddities, and discoveries are often found in Ancients' caches or in the hoard of a conquered monster that previously visited an Ancient's cache.": "密码、遗物、铁肤、古怪物品和发现经常被发现在古代遗物储藏所或者被征服的怪物的藏品中，这些怪物之前曾经访问过一个古代遗物储藏所。",
	"Locations include those containing machines and machine scrap, functioning or dead installations, integrated machines, crashed or working vehicles, automatons (a kind of construct), or caches of alchemical substances or other materials.": "包括那些包含机器和机器废料、运转或废弃设备、整合机器、坠毁或运行车辆、自动人（一种构造物）或炼金物质或其他材料储藏的地点。",
	"Monsters with such devices include those associated with a particular vault or cache, or creatures who have previously looted such a place or otherwise obtained arcana of the Ancients.": "拥有这种装置的怪物包括与特定金库或储藏室相关的怪物，或者曾经掠夺过这样的地方或以其他方式获得了远古奥秘的生物。",
	"The salvaging process includes extracting a functioning device of the Ancients from some larger device, machine, or even a defunct construct or creature with devices integrated into its flesh. This process also often includes manipulating what is found to cobble together something that works (though identifying what it does before it's used is a separate Intelligence ({@variantrule Optional Rule: Intelligence (Ancients Arcana)|AotA|Arcana}) check). For example, the PCs' search might entail not just finding a device but also figuring out that if they hook it up to a nearby energy-producing object, open a small panel, and fiddle with the workings, they produce the device's effect (which might not be the device's original use at all).": "拯救过程包括从某个更大的设备、机器，甚至是一个不再运转的构造物或生物体中提取出一台古代设备。这个过程通常也包括操纵所发现的东西，拼凑出一个能够运转的东西（尽管在使用之前确定它的功能需要进行一个独立的智力检定（{@variantrule Optional Rule: Intelligence (Ancients Arcana)|AotA|Arcana}））。例如，角色们的搜索可能不仅仅是找到一个设备，还要弄清楚如果他们将其连接到附近的能源产生物体，打开一个小面板，然后摆弄一下机件，他们就能产生设备的效果（这个效果可能根本不是设备最初的用途）。",
	"When the PCs come upon an area where salvaging numenera might be possible, the GM may call for a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check or an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. It's ideal if characters can devote at least ten minutes to an hour to exploring and poring over a suitable source. Characters skilled in Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) can apply half their regular proficiency bonus.": "当角色们发现一个可能进行废墟回收的区域时，GM可能会要求进行一个感知({@skill Perception})检定或智力({@skill Investigation})检定。最好角色能够至少花费十分钟到一个小时来探索和研究一个合适的来源。擅长智力({@skill Arcana})的角色可以应用他们一半的常规熟练加值。",
	"The GM sets the salvaging DC, usually 10.": "GM设置拆解的难度等级，通常为10。",
	"Numenera devices have rarities that correspond with magic items: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, or legendary. These rarities provide a rough gauge on each item's relative power. If the GM is in the habit of using treasure hoard tables, those rarities roughly correspond to magic item rarities in terms of relative power. However, they do not correspond to actual odds of being found as part of random treasures, because all Ancients items are extremely rare, usually only associated with Ancients' vaults and caches, or in the possession of NPCs or creatures that have looted such a cache.": "Numenera（奇物纪元）设备有与魔法物品对应的稀有度：普通（common）、罕见（uncommon）、稀有（rare）、非常稀有（very rare）、或传奇（legendary）。这些稀有度大致反映了每个物品相对强大的程度。如果GM习惯使用宝藏表，这些稀有度大致对应于魔法物品稀有度，就相对强度而言。然而，它们并不对应于实际被发现的几率，因为所有古代物品都非常罕见，通常只与古代人的宝库和储藏室相关联，或者在NPC或掠夺了这种储藏室的生物的所有权下。",
	"Once the PCs find or salvage a device of the Ancients, identifying what it might actually do ahead of time, before the item is first used, is an additional Intelligence (Arcana) check (halved proficiency, unless the Ancients Arcana optional rule is used).": "一旦角色找到或打捞到一件古代装置，在首次使用之前，要提前确定它可能的功能，需要进行额外的智力（奥秘）检定（熟练加值减半，除非使用了古代奥秘可选规则）。（Ancients Arcana）",
	"The GM sets the check DC, usually 10 for cyphers and oddities, and 15 for relics and iron flesh. The process takes 1 to 10 minutes. If the attempt fails, PCs may retry, but all identification retry checks have disadvantage.": "GM设置检定 DC，通常奇物和古怪物品为 10，遗物和铁肤为 15。这个过程需要 1 到 10 分钟。如果尝试失败，玩家角色可以重试，但所有鉴定重试检定都有劣势。",
	"A character can attempt to use a device that is not identified; this is usually a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Failure might mean that the PC can't figure out how to use the device or that they use it incorrectly (GM's discretion). Of course, even if the PC uses the unidentified device correctly, they have no idea what its effect will be. Most of the time, using an identified Ancients device is one action, unless specified otherwise.": "一个角色可以尝试使用一个未被识别的装置；通常需要进行一次 DC 15 的智力（奥秘）检定。失败可能意味着角色无法弄清楚如何使用该装置，或者他们使用错误（由GM决定）。当然，即使角色正确使用了未被识别的装置，他们也不知道其效果会是什么。大多数情况下，使用一个已被识别的远古装置只需要一个行动，除非另有规定。",
	"The rules for identifying the numenera assume that a character has previously had some experience finding and figuring out similar items of the Ancients. The GM may wish to put more of a spotlight on the PCs' {@i first} interaction with and attempts to identify a device's function. In this case, the character needs to make Intelligence checks before failing two to identify the object and determine what it does when triggered. Each failure might have some small side effect (such as a weird buzz, glow, a shock, or something related to the item's function). If the overall attempt is a failure, the GM may introduce a complication that results in the device being prematurely triggered, probably negatively affecting the PC.": "确定奇物规则假定角色先前曾有一些经验，发现和弄清楚类似的古代物品。GM可能希望更加关注PCs{@i first}与设备的互动以及尝试识别设备功能的过程。在这种情况下，角色需要在失败两次之前进行智力检定，以识别物品并确定触发后的效果。每次失败可能会产生一些小的副作用（比如奇怪的嗡嗡声、发光、电击，或与物品功能相关的事物）。如果整体尝试失败，GM可能会引入一个并发症，导致设备被过早触发，可能会对PC产生负面影响。",
	"After a PC has identified a device of the Ancients once or twice, use the regular rules for identifying the numenera.": "在PC已经识别过一两次远古装置后，使用常规规则来识别奇物。",
	"A cypher is a leftover device of vanished civilizations so advanced that even their cast-off technology provides amazing effects. The use a PC finds for the cypher is probably not the use originally intended. Cyphers are not magical, though their effects may seem so.": "密码是消失的文明留下的遗物，这些文明非常先进，即使是他们抛弃的技术也能产生惊人的效果。玩家角色（PC）对密码的用途可能与最初的用途不同。密码并非魔法，尽管它们的效果可能看起来像魔法。",
	"Cyphers are often found in groups of one to six (the GM can roll {@dice 1d6} to determine the number found). The GM can prepare a list ahead of time of what successful searchers find. Sometimes this list is random, and sometimes logic can dictate content. For example, the PCs might find four different pills in the same location, which once might have stored pharmaceuticals.": "密码通常以一到六个为一组（GM可以掷骰{@dice 1d6}来确定找到的数量）。GM可以提前准备一个列表，列出成功搜索者会发现的内容。有时这个列表是随机的，有时逻辑可以决定内容。例如，角色可能会在同一个地点找到四种不同的药丸，这个地方曾经可能存放过药品。",
	"Cyphers are consumable items. Using a cypher usually requires an action, but could take longer, as specified in its description. Once used, a cypher takes effect immediately, leaving behind a defunct device with no further obvious function. Cyphers that can be used to make attacks include a relevant save DC in their descriptions.": "密码是一次性物品。使用一个密码通常需要一个动作，但根据其描述，可能需要更长时间。一旦使用，密码立即生效，留下一个无法再发挥作用的设备。可以用于攻击的密码在其描述中包含相关的豁免 DC。",
	"If too many cyphers are carried by the same PC—usually more than 3—a strange and dangerous resonance builds between the devices and the PC's mind and body. Most don't wait to find out what happens if that resonance goes to completion, because it's usually bad. . . if not right away, then eventually. When things finally go bad, the cyphers that exceed this limit are destroyed. More serious consequences involve permanent reduction in the PC's physical stats when all their cyphers melt together into a burning slag heap, a horrendous war machine of the Ancients spontaneously arising at the location, or the character being sucked through a brief, tiny singularity and destroyed beyond recovery.": "如果同一玩家角色携带了太多的密码（通常超过3个），这些设备与玩家角色的思维和身体之间会建立起一种奇怪而危险的共振。大多数人不会等到看到这种共振发展到最后会发生什么，因为通常情况下结果都不太好……即使不是立即，也会在以后。当事情最终变糟时，超过这个限制的密码会被摧毁。更严重的后果包括当所有密码融化成一团燃烧的熔渣堆时，玩家角色的身体属性永久减少，远古的可怕战争机器会在该位置自发出现，或者角色被吸入一个短暂的微型奇点并被摧毁，无法恢复。",
	"Using the {@table Cypher Danger Table|AotA}, roll {@dice d100} and then add 10 to the result for each cypher over the character's maximum limit. For cyphers that don't seem like they should be particularly volatile, such as pills, elixirs, or other simple or mundane items, add nothing—or, if you prefer, subtract 10 from the result. If the result is nonsensical, move up one result. If it is still nonsensical, move down one result from the original. Continue until a logical result occurs. Roll on the table each day that the cyphers are gathered together.": "在与当地语言习惯一致的情况下，对文本中的诸如(%num%)之类的内容在翻译中仍应保持为(%num%)。\n\n使用{@table Cypher Danger Table|AotA}，投掷{@dice d100}，然后对结果每超过角色最大限制的密码加10。对于那些看起来不应该特别不稳定的密码，比如药丸、灵丹或其他简单或平凡的物品，不添加任何内容，或者如果您愿意，从结果中减去10。如果结果不合逻辑，则向上移动一个结果。如果仍然不合逻辑，则从原始结果向下移动一个结果。继续直到出现合乎逻辑的结果。每天将密码聚集在一起时在表格上投掷。",
	"Additional GM guidance for {@book using cyphers|AotA|1|Using Cyphers in Your Game} is provided in {@book Chapter 5|AotA|1}.": "{@book using cyphers|AotA|1|Using Cyphers in Your Game}的额外GM指导可在{@book Chapter 5|AotA|1}中找到。",
	"Cyphers have different forms based on three parameters: internal, wearable, and usable. Internal cyphers are things you ingest or inject. Wearable cyphers are articles of clothing, jewelry, or other things you wear on your physical body. Usable cyphers are basically anything else.": "密码具有不同的形式，基于三个参数：内部、可穿戴和可使用。内部密码是您摄入或注射的物品。可穿戴密码是您身体上穿的衣服、珠宝或其他物品。可使用密码基本上是其他任何东西。",
	"Individual cypher descriptions present the most common form they are found in. Most cyphers can exist in more than one form, but all forms work the same way. For example, an {@item antivenom pill|AotA|antivenom} can be found in the form of a pill, an ingestible liquid, or an injector. GMs can go with the indicated cypher form to speed play. However, nothing is impossible. If the GM wants a pill that allows anyone swallowing it to teleport, then it exists.": "个别密码描述展示了它们最常见的形式。大多数密码可以存在于多种形式中，但所有形式的功能都是一样的。例如，一个{@item antivenom pill|AotA|antivenom}可以以药丸、可吞食液体或注射器的形式出现。GM可以选择指定的密码形式来加快游戏进程。然而，没有什么是不可能的。如果GM想要一种药丸，让任何吞食它的人都能传送，那么它就存在。",
	"Relics are the devices left over from the civilizations of the past. These are devices of a more permanent nature than cyphers (unless they run out of power) with more straightforward applications—weapons, armor, utility items, and so on. Still, they are rarely straightforward in actual use. Rather than find a device that was meant to be used as a weapon, the PCs are far more likely to find an item that was originally intended for another purpose but that has been modified (as best as contemporary understanding can manage) and now can be used as a ranged weapon.": "遗物是过去文明留下的装置。这些装置比密码更持久（除非用尽能量），具有更直接的应用——武器、盔甲、实用品等等。然而，在实际使用中很少是直截了当的。玩家角色更有可能找到一个最初用于其他目的但经过改造（尽可能符合当代理解）后现在可以用作远程武器的物品，而不是找到一个原本就是武器的装置。",
	"Remember that relics are incomprehensible devices, likely powered by transdimensional siphons using nanotechnology to rewrite reality on an atomic or subatomic level. Even to someone who understands a great deal about Ancients arcana, most relics {@i appear} to be more magic than machine. Of course, they are not actually magical.": "记住，遗物是难以理解的装置，可能由跨维度虹吸器提供动力，利用纳米技术在原子或亚原子级别重写现实。即使对于了解古代奥秘的人来说，大多数遗物{@i appear}看起来更像是魔法而不是机器。当然，它们实际上并不是魔法。",
	"Still, some relics require attunement to use. You can be attuned to no more than three attunable relics at a time. If you bear more than three attunable items (including attunable magic items and iron flesh), only a subset of them will provide their functions and/or magic abilities, depending on which you've selected.": "然而，一些遗物需要调谐才能使用。你一次最多只能调谐三个可调谐的遗物。如果你携带超过三个可调谐物品（包括可调谐魔法物品和铁质护甲），只有其中的一部分会提供它们的功能和/或魔法能力，取决于你选择了哪些。",
	"Many relics have a chance of power depletion per use, rather than having a set number of charges per day like some magic items and iron flesh. If a relic with a depletion is used or activated, the player rolls the designated die (1d6, 1d10, 1d20, or 1d100). If the die shows the depletion number(s), the item works, but that is its last use. Some devices never deplete, some require attunement, and those with an entry of \"automatic\" can be used only once.": "许多遗物每次使用都有一定几率耗尽能量，而不像一些魔法物品和铁肤那样每天拥有固定次数的充能。如果一个有耗尽机制的遗物被使用或激活，玩家需要掷指定的骰子（1d6、1d10、1d20或1d100）。如果骰子显示出耗尽数字，该物品会生效，但那将是它的最后一次使用。一些装置永远不会耗尽，一些需要调谐，而那些标有“自动”条目的只能使用一次。",
	"For instance, a {@item mephitic staff|AotA} has a depletion of 1 in 1d20. When a player rolls a d20 to check the depletion and gets a 1, the relic depletes, and that usage is the last time the relic works.": "例如，一个{@item mephitic staff|AotA}在1d20中有1点消耗。当玩家投掷一枚d20来检查消耗，并且投掷到1时，遗物就会消耗殆尽，这次使用也是遗物最后一次发挥作用。",
	"If a relic with a depletion could be used in a way that doesn't require a depletion roll, the circumstances under which the depletion must be checked are specified.": "如果一个带有消耗的遗物可以以不需要进行消耗检定的方式使用，那么必须明确在何种情况下必须检查消耗。",
	"Relics often aren't entirely what they seem. An item that functions like a weapon in the PC's hands once might have been a part of a very different device with a very different purpose. Another relic might be a cobbled-together mess of various parts, created by someone who didn't really understand what they were doing. Thus, sometimes relics don't do what is expected, or they do something in addition to their desired function. These are {@table List of Relic Quirks|AotA|relic quirks}.": "遗物通常并非完全如其表面所示。在PC的手中发挥武器作用的物品，可能曾经是一个完全不同用途的设备的一部分。另一个遗物可能是由各种部件拼凑而成，由一个并不真正了解自己在做什么的人创造。因此，有时遗物并不按预期运作，或者除了其预期功能之外还会产生其他效果。这些是{@table List of Relic Quirks|AotA|relic quirks}。",
	"Quirks might be a requirement for activation. They could be side effects that happen all the time with the relic, either continuously or each time it is activated. They might also be something that happens occasionally—for example, quirks could be a good time for the GM to throw a complication at a PC.": "怪癖可能是激活的必要条件。它们可能是与遗物一直发生的副作用，无论是持续发生还是每次激活时发生。它们也可能是偶尔发生的事情——例如，怪癖可能是GM向PC抛出复杂情况的好时机。",
	"Some machines discovered in the crypts of the Ancients latch onto explorers, implanting their flesh with a sparking iron device. The intruding object could slowly render the explorer to a fine powder, insinuate their mind with horrific images, or enact some other unwanted change. However, the implant could instead grant an all-new beneficial capability.": "在古代文明的地下墓穴中发现了一些机器，它们会依附在探险者身上，植入他们的肉体中，带有一个闪烁的铁制装置。这个侵入性物体可能会慢慢将探险者变成细粉，灌输他们的头脑恐怖的影像，或者实施其他不受欢迎的改变。然而，这种植入物也可能赋予探险者全新的有益能力。",
	"Such beneficial implants are known as {@table Random Iron Flesh Table|AotA|iron flesh}.": "这种有益的植入物被称为{@table Random Iron Flesh Table|AotA|iron flesh}。",
	"Though the abilities conferred by an iron flesh implant may seem supernatural, iron flesh is not magical.": "尽管铁肤植入物赋予的能力可能看起来超自然，但铁肤并非魔法。",

	"You can have multiple instances of iron flesh, except in cases in which common sense would argue otherwise. For instance, you could have up to two iron flesh eye implants (one for each eye), two iron flesh gauntlets (one for each hand), but only one helm, spine, or heart. If you have an iron flesh that comes in the form of a spine implant, you could later replace it with a different spine, but lose the first.": "您可以拥有多个铁皮（iron flesh）实例，除非常识告诉您不能。例如，您可以拥有最多两个铁皮眼植入物（一个用于每只眼睛），两个铁皮护手（一个用于每只手），但只能有一个头盔（helm）、脊柱（spine）或心脏（heart）。如果您有一个以脊柱植入物形式存在的铁皮，您可以随后用不同的脊柱替换它，但会失去第一个。",
	"Normal rules for attunement also continue to apply.": "同时，普通的符合规则也仍然适用。",
	"Using iron flesh requires more of a commitment than other items, given that iron flesh essentially becomes part of the creature using it. Sometimes someone with iron flesh wants to remove it because it has stopped working, because a PC wants to put a different implant in its place, or because it is doing something unexpected. The procedure for removing iron flesh is akin to pulling out a minor organ. Unless a machine of the Ancients is found that can accomplish the procedure somewhat safely, removing a piece of iron flesh drops a character to 0 hit points, at which point they must begin making death saving throws each round until they stabilize (three DC 10 successes) or die. Of course, allies with healing abilities could step in with immediate assistance so the character never has to face death saving throws.": "使用铁肤比起其他物品需要更多的承诺，因为铁肤本质上成为了使用者的一部分。有时候，拥有铁肤的人想要移除它，因为它停止起作用了，因为某位玩家角色想要用另一种植入物替代它，或者因为它出现了意外情况。移除铁肤的程序类似于拔除一个小器官。除非找到一台远古机器可以相对安全地完成这个程序，否则移除一块铁肤会让角色的生命值降为0，此时他们必须开始每轮进行死亡豁免检定，直到稳定下来（三次DC 10的成功）或死亡。当然，拥有治疗能力的盟友可以立即提供帮助，使角色永远不必面对死亡豁免检定。",
	"At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature.

One cypher might make the air smell sweeter for an hour, while the one found right next to it could have the power to blast a hole in the fabric of space for a few seconds, destroying all creatures within 60 feet. This means that finding a device that confers a fantastic ability might be somewhat more likely when exploring a cache. However, Ancients' caches are equally likely to contain inscrutable threats that are difficult to discern or avoid, even when the devices looted from it do not seem especially powerful.": "与宝藏中有时发现的魔法物品不同，发现“第(num)纪物”的机会更加难以捉摸，不遵循预期的规律或原因。例如，一个特定的远古人的隐藏宝库可能包含一些密码。一个密码可能让空气在一个小时内变得更加芬香，而紧挨着它发现的密码可能具有在几秒钟内在空间中开个洞的能力，摧毁60英尺内的所有生物。这意味着在探索宝库时，找到一个赋予了奇妙能力的装置可能会更有可能。然而，远古人的隐藏宝库同样可能包含难以辨别或避免的难以捉摸的威胁，即使从中掠夺的装置似乎并不特别强大。",

	"First, they provide verisimilitude—not everything is suited for an explorer. Second, they're interesting—weird little things that can be sold or used for barter or gifts. Third, and perhaps most important, they add more mystery and feelings of the unknown to the game because oddities are really, well, odd. Why did their creators make them? Were they once a part of a larger device with a more understandable function? No one knows, and it's likely that no one ever will.": "首先，它们提供逼真性—并非所有东西都适合探险者。其次，它们很有趣—一些奇怪的小东西，可以出售、用于交换或作为礼物。第三，也许最重要的是，它们为游戏增添了更多神秘感和未知感，因为这些奇异之物确实很奇怪。它们的创造者为什么制造它们？它们曾经是更大设备的一部分，具有更容易理解的功能吗？没有人知道，很可能永远也不会知道。",
	"Oddities can be traded, sold, used, or given as interesting gifts. Usually, their value is around 10 gp, but some oddities might fetch as much as 50 gp depending on their potential utility.": "奇珍异宝可以被交易、出售、使用，或作为有趣的礼物赠送。通常，它们的价值在10 gp左右，但一些奇珍异宝可能会根据其潜在实用性而卖到50 gp。",

Current-day artisans might set some of the oddities into jewelry or on the end of a staff.": "许多列出的奇特之处都被描述得模糊不清，以便GM根据需要进行调整。尺寸、颜色、形状等等都可以改变。现代的工匠们可能会把一些奇特之处镶嵌在珠宝上，或者放在法杖的顶端。",
	"GMs are encouraged to ensure that oddities always seem odd. One day, have a PC's oddity work differently. For example, the cup that boils liquid now freezes it instead. The rod with blinking lights goes wild with lights and starts beeping as well. The small mirrored cube starts spinning on its own. No explanation is needed because the owner didn't really understand the oddity in the first place.": "鼓励GM确保奇异之物看起来总是很奇怪。有一天，让一个PC的奇异之物表现得与往常不同。例如，原本会煮沸液体的杯子现在却会将其冻结。带有闪烁灯光的棒子会灯光疯狂闪烁，并开始发出哔哔声。小镜面立方体会自行旋转起来。不需要解释，因为所有者本来就不真正理解这个奇异之物。",

	"A mutation is a change in a creature's genes that makes it different than the genes from its parents. Some mutations are minor and inconsequential, like having blue eyes instead of brown eyes; some are significant, like being able to create a slippery slime with your skin; and some are detrimental, like a hand missing fingers or an eye that can't see color. A creature might be a mutant from birth, or become a mutant later in life. A mutant's abilities might manifest early on, or lay dormant until triggered by a stressful event. It is possible for any sort of living creature—including a PC—to be born as or become a mutant. Having a mutation doesn't change a creature's species. A mutant high elf is still a high elf, a mutant bugbear is still a bugbear, and a mutant red dragon is still a red dragon.": "突变是指生物基因的改变，使其与父母的基因不同。一些突变是微小且无关紧要的，比如眼睛是蓝色而不是棕色；一些是重要的，比如能够用皮肤制造一种滑腻的粘液；还有一些是有害的，比如手指缺失或眼睛无法看到颜色。生物可能从出生时就是突变体，也可能在后来的生活中变异。突变体的能力可能早早地显现出来，也可能处于休眠状态，直到受到压力事件的触发。任何类型的生物，包括PC，都有可能天生或变异为突变体。突变并不会改变生物的物种。突变的高等精灵仍然是高等精灵，突变的巨熊人仍然是巨熊人，突变的红龙仍然是红龙。",
	"A mutation might be accidental or deliberate. Exposure to powerful energy sources such as radiation and extradimensional energy can cause tiny changes in a creature's genes that manifest as a mutation. Exotic chemicals and certain poisonous substances (including wastelands) are known to cause mutations in creatures who survive exposure to them. The Ancients dabbled in creating and altering life, and some of their experiments used strange processes and devices that created specific mutations in their subjects.": "突变可能是意外的，也可能是故意的。暴露于强大能源源头，如辐射和超维能量，可能会导致生物基因发生微小变化，表现为突变。异国化学物质和某些有毒物质（包括荒野）已知会导致暴露后幸存的生物发生突变。古代人曾涉足于创造和改变生命，其中一些实验使用了奇特的过程和装置，导致实验对象发生特定的突变。",
	"Mutants with similar traits sometimes band together. Those with hideous deformities face discrimination and derision. Some are outcasts, and others are revered, flaunting their mutations as a sign of superiority, power, and influence. Their mutations are seen as a blessing, not a curse. Some people believe them to be divine.": "有时具有相似特征的变种体会聚在一起。那些长有丑陋畸形的人面临歧视和嘲笑。有些人被排斥在外，而另一些人却备受尊崇，炫耀他们的变异作为优越、力量和影响力的象征。他们的变异被视为一种祝福，而非诅咒。有些人认为他们是神圣的。",
	"Mutations are often hereditary, passed down from parent to child like any other trait, such as a hawkish nose or red hair. Over many generations, a mutation may spread throughout a community, and multiple mutations might change a group of creatures enough that they truly become a new species—{@creature chirog|AotA|chirogs}, {@creature killist|AotA|killisti}, and {@creature margr|AotA} may once have been creatures like humans, goblins, and orcs, changed over time by mutation and inbreeding until they stabilized in their current forms.": "突变通常是遗传的，像其他特征一样，从父母传给孩子，比如鹰钩鼻或红发。经过许多代的传承，一个突变可能在整个群体中传播开来，多个突变可能会改变一群生物到足以真正成为一个新物种——{@creature chirog|AotA|chirogs}，{@creature killist|AotA|killisti}，和{@creature margr|AotA}可能曾经是像人类，地精和兽人一样的生物，经过时间的突变和近亲繁殖，最终稳定在他们当前的形态中。",
	"Five categories of mutation exist. {@table Beneficial mutations|AotA} bring about changes that are neither physically obvious nor extraordinary. {@table Powerful mutations|AotA} are like beneficial ones, but more potent. {@table Harmful mutations|AotA} are physical changes that are usually grotesque and somewhat debilitating. The fourth category, {@table distinctive mutations|AotA}, also provides significant abilities, but they mark the character as an obvious mutant.

	"In theory, there is a sixth category that might be called crippling mutations, but player characters never have this kind of mutation.

	"With the GM's permission, you can play a character who was born a mutant or became a mutant before 1st level. These mutants have special abilities unavailable to other starting characters, but they come at a cost.

	"For example, Darcy wants to play a mutant high elf. Her character gets all of the elf and high elf traits except their ability score bonuses (the elf +2 bonus to Dexterity and the high elf +1 bonus to Intelligence). She decides to take a risk and chooses to have three beneficial mutations and one harmful mutation. For her beneficial mutations she rolls 54 (poison resistance), 90 (slashing resistance), and 92 (bludgeoning resistance). For her harmful mutation, she rolls 48 (slow and lumbering). For distinctive mutations, she rolls 89 (eyes on stalks) and decides to stop before the character gets any weirder, and doesn't roll for any cosmetic mutations. Darcy then finishes her character (class, background, and so on) in the normal way.": "例如，达西想扮演一个突变的高等精灵。她的角色获得所有精灵和高等精灵的特征，除了它们的能力得分奖励（精灵+2敏捷奖励和高等精灵+1智力奖励）。她决定冒险，选择三个有益突变和一个有害突变。对于有益突变，她掷出了54（抗毒）、90（抗割伤）和92（抗钝击）。对于有害突变，她掷出了48（缓慢笨拙）。对于独特突变，她掷出了89（眼睛伸出茎），并决定在角色变得更奇怪之前停下来，不再掷任何美观突变。然后，达西以正常方式完成她的角色（职业、背景等）。",

Each of these has great potential use to the PCs, but it's likely a onetime thing and they can't take it with them to use later. Discoveries are best thought of as part of an adventure as opposed to part of a PC's equipment. In this way, as with cyphers, you don't have to hold back when creating discoveries. The one rule of thumb should be that the cooler they are, the more challenging they are to reach. In some ways, these are proverbial treasure hoards.": "发现是所有纳米器物中最开放的类型。发现是那些太大而无法成为装备的东西，但仍然可能有一些酷炫的功能——比如通往另一个星球的传送门、进行机械植入手术的机器，或者可以无限存储任何东西的力场立方体储存设施。这些发现对玩家角色(PCs)有很大的潜在用途，但很可能只能使用一次，他们无法将其带走以便以后使用。发现最好被视为冒险的一部分，而不是玩家角色的装备的一部分。因此，与纳米器物一样，当创造发现时你无需保留。一个经验法则应该是，它们越酷，达到它们的难度就越大。在某种程度上，这些就像是传说中的宝藏库。",
	"But not every discovery has to be of use to the PCs. Sometimes they are interesting for their own sake—and thus still worth finding and interacting with.": "但并非每个发现都必须对PCs有用。有时候，它们仅仅因为本身的价值而有趣—因此仍然值得发现和互动。",

	"\"The numenera\" is a term that refers to anything that seems supernatural and that comes from the prior ages that predated even the Elder Elves. From a 21st-century point of view, this means devices, machines, vehicles, robots, computers, weapons, satellites, drugs, and so on. But it also means bioengineered creatures, cybernetic beings, and creatures brought here from alien worlds in other solar systems, or dimensions beyond those typically understood to be part of cosmology. In other words, it's not just high tech, but also devices that surpass even our 21st-century understanding—things that manipulate time, space, gravity, and more.": "“Numenera（奇物）”是一个术语，指的是任何看起来超自然的事物，来自甚至早于远古精灵的时代。从21世纪的角度来看，这包括设备、机器、车辆、机器人、计算机、武器、卫星、药物等等。但它也指的是生物工程生物、机械生物，以及从其他太阳系、宇宙维度中带到这里的外星世界生物。换句话说，这不仅仅是高科技，还有超越我们21世纪理解的设备——能够操纵时间、空间、引力等等的事物。",
	"However, it's important to remember that the player characters don't look at the numenera the way that 21st-century people look at technology. In a fantasy world, a force field projector and a two-way radio would seem not only like magic, but magic of the same level of power. In fact, the radio might seem more potent because its use is broader, and its effects are \"invisible.\" Characters with a medieval sensibility have no perspective on what sorts of technology are more advanced than others, and they take none of it for granted.": "然而，重要的是要记住，玩家角色不会像21世纪的人那样看待奇物(`numenera`)。在一个幻想世界中，一个力场投射器和一个双向无线电通讯设备看起来不仅像魔法，而且是同一级别的魔法。事实上，无线电可能看起来更强大，因为它的使用范围更广，而且其效果是“看不见的”。具有中世纪感觉的角色对哪种技术比其他技术更先进没有任何概念，并且他们对此一无所知。",
	"The same is likely true of many of the creatures presented in {@book Arcana of the Ancients|AotA}. Commoners will likely think that most of them are simply \"demons.\" PC adventurers will likely learn differently, but the average villager, townsperson, trader, or guard in a fantasy setting doesn't have the knowledge or perspective to imagine that a thing nearly 20 feet tall that hungers for flesh is anything other than a supernatural beast of pure evil. But in truth, this thing—in this case a {@creature jiraskar|AotA}—is not a demon in the planar sense, but actually an apex predator, one of many somehow transported from the Ancients' time. Despite their size, they are animals. But the dangers that these creatures pose make a commoner's perceptions understandable. The concept of a demon—a spiritually evil entity—is a label for threats that can't be understood. To lump all creatures that hunger for flesh and hunt humans together as demons is clearly simplistic. Worse, doing so probably robs locals of potential strategies for dealing with such a creature. An animal can be dealt with. But a demon?": "同样的情况很可能也适用于{@book Arcana of the Ancients|AotA}中呈现的许多生物。普通百姓可能会认为它们大多只是\"恶魔\"。PC冒险者可能会有不同的看法，但在幻想设定中，普通村民、城镇居民、商人或卫兵没有足够的知识或视角来想象一个近20英尺高、渴望肉体的生物除了是纯邪恶的超自然野兽之外还可能是其他什么。但事实上，这种生物——在这种情况下是一个{@creature jiraskar|AotA}——并不是在位面意义上的恶魔，而实际上是一种顶级捕食者，是从古代时期某种方式传送过来的众多生物之一。尽管它们体型庞大，但它们只是动物。但这些生物带来的危险使普通百姓的看法可以理解。恶魔这个概念——一种精神上邪恶的实体——是对无法理解的威胁的标签。将所有渴望肉体并猎杀人类的生物都归为恶魔显然是简单化的。更糟糕的是，这样做可能会剥夺当地人处理这种生物的潜在策略。动物是可以处理的。但恶魔呢？",
	"Luckily, your PCs are likely to learn to discern the difference in time.": "幸运的是，你的角色很可能会学会分辨时间的差异。",
	"The adventure in Chapter 2—The Hills of Crooked Sleep—is designed to be the event that brings the numenera into your 5E game. During the course of the adventure, an incredible Ancients' cache is found and triggered. This has wide-ranging consequences.

	"However, the speed at which you want to introduce new material to your game is obviously completely up to you. If you'd rather keep each introduction of the numenera under strict control, in your game maybe a new cache must be searched out and opened by PCs each time something from this book is presented.": "然而，您希望将新材料引入游戏的速度完全取决于您自己。如果您更愿意严格控制每次引入(%num%)的奇迹物品，也许在您的游戏中，每次呈现本书内容时，玩家角色必须搜索并打开一个新的隐藏宝藏。",
	"You might prefer a more mixed approach. If PCs are opening caches, it's likely that NPCs are too. Not to mention powerful monsters like dragons, liches, demons, and of course, wizards eager to find new lore, danger be damned. Repercussions from such activities likely begin as a slow trickle, but could grow in magnitude over time, especially as entities locked away for time out of mind begin to find their way in the campaign world.": "你可能更喜欢一种更加混合的方法。如果玩家角色(PCs)正在打开储藏箱，那么NPCs也很可能在这样做。更不用说像龙、巫妖、恶魔，当然还有渴望发现新知识的巫师这样的强大怪物。这些活动可能带来的后果可能一开始只是缓慢的涓涓细流，但随着那些被封印了无数年的实体开始进入战役世界，后果可能会随着时间的推移而不断增大。",
	"Or not. It's entirely up to you. In your game, vaults containing the numenera might be so rare and hard to find that only PCs have means to find them, and then not easily. If you're at all leery about the prospect of flooding your world with weird machines and devices, start slowly. You can always decide that new caches become available or open on their own later on, especially if a good story reason to do so occurs to you.": "或者不这样做。这完全取决于你。在你的游戏中，包含奇物的保险库可能是如此罕见和难以找到，以至于只有(%num%)玩家角色有办法找到它们，而且并不容易。如果你对用奇异的机器和装置淹没你的世界感到有些担忧，那就慢慢开始。你总是可以决定新的隐藏地点或者自行开放，尤其是如果你觉得有一个好的故事理由这样做的话。",
	"It's very likely that as numenera gets out into the world, it falls into the hands of NPCs. And perhaps some of it has been around all along. Perhaps, for example, the floating castle that everyone assumed was magical is actually sustained by a machine from ancient times.": "随着奇物(numenera)传播到世界各地，很可能会落入NPC的手中。也许其中一些奇物一直存在。例如，大家都以为是魔法的漂浮城堡，实际上可能是古代机器维持着它。",

	"Devices like cyphers, relics, and iron flesh do not individually call out their effects as being treated as if magic; however, they should be treated as producing magical effects if there is some question whether a triggered ability could affect a monster with magic resistance. For example, if a PC uses their {@item winter torque|AotA} iron flesh to create a cold burst that might affect a devil that has magic resistance, the devil's magic resistance applies.": "诸如密码器、遗物和铁肤之类的装置并没有单独指明它们的效果被视为魔法；然而，如果有疑问某个触发能力是否会影响具有魔法抗性的怪物，它们应被视为产生魔法效果。例如，如果一名玩家角色使用他们的{@item winter torque|AotA} 铁肤制造一个寒冷爆炸，可能影响到具有魔法抗性的恶魔，那么恶魔的魔法抗性会生效。",
	"There are a couple reasons for this default position, which go hand in hand.": "这个默认位置有几个原因，彼此相辅相成。",
	"Story-wise, the fundamental extradimensional or cosmic energy that Ancients' technology uses might well be the same supernatural field that wizards and gods draw upon. Though the techniques used to produce the effects are different, they both stem from the same original font of chaos and change that underlies reality.": "故事上，远古科技使用的基本超维或宇宙能量很可能与巫师和神灵借用的超自然领域相同。尽管产生效果的技术不同，但它们都源自同一原始的混沌和变化之源，这是现实的基础。",
	"Balance-wise, this allows the machines, devices, and creatures presented in this book to fit into the already-balanced ecosystem of the 5E ruleset, a ruleset that has given much thought to how magical effects play out among powerful entities.": "在平衡方面，这使得本书中呈现的机器、设备和生物能够融入《第五版规则集》已经平衡的生态系统中，这个规则集已经深思熟虑了魔法效果在强大实体之间如何发挥作用。",
	"That said, you could go a different way, and treat magic and the energies created by Ancients devices as fundamentally different.": "话虽如此，你也可以选择另一种方式，将魔法和由远古设备创造的能量视为根本不同。",
	"It's viable run a game where the technology of the Ancients bypasses warding designed to keep out magic and ignores magic resistance. Using this option means that creatures, such as the previously mentioned devil, would not gain any additional protection from a character using a numenera device on it as they would if resisting a spell.": "在游戏中设定古代科技可以绕过旨在阻挡魔法的结界，并无视魔法抗性是可行的。使用这个选项意味着，诸如之前提到的恶魔之类的生物，不会像抵抗咒语那样从角色使用奇物装置获得额外保护。",
	"On the other hand, powerful creatures introduced in this book would not have their attacks treated as if magical (assuming you ignored the ability in their stat block indicating to the contrary). This would render certain extant magical creatures, especially those with immunity to nonmagical attacks, as unassailable by some of the most powerful creatures released from the Ancients' caches.": "另一方面，本书中介绍的强大生物的攻击不会被视为魔法攻击（假设你忽略了其属性块中指示相反的能力）。这将使得某些现存的魔法生物，尤其是那些对非魔法攻击免疫的生物，对一些从远古宝库释放出来的最强大生物无法攻击。",
	"At least at first. Because such a situation could lead to a variety of interesting stories. For example, some of the powerful entities described in these pages, such as a {@creature quotien|AotA}, would likely undertake a research project to alleviate such a discrepancy immediately. That project might provide some numenera tool able to focus magic, or it might lead the quotien to learn magic for itself or to acquire potent magic items, further empowering it.": "至少起初是这样的。因为这种情况可能会引发各种有趣的故事。例如，这些页面中描述的一些强大实体，比如一个{@creature quotien|AotA}，可能会立即着手进行研究项目来消除这种差异。该项目可能会提供一些能够聚焦魔法的奇物工具，或者可能会导致该实体学习魔法或获取强大的魔法物品，进一步增强它的力量。",
	"Sometimes, the magic-numenera nonequivalence will raise unobvious questions you'll have to be prepared to answer. For instance, if a character gets their hands on a {@item matter evaporator|AotA} cypher and tries to use it on a magical tome specifically ensorcelled to resist normal, non-magical damage, should the matter evaporator simply fail to work on it? The answer might be yes in this case, though it might create a cavity around the tome into which the book drops.": "有时，魔法-数能物（magic-numenera）的非等价性会引发一些难以预料的问题，你必须做好准备来回答。例如，如果一个角色得到了一个{@item matter evaporator|AotA}奇晶（cypher），并试图将其用在一个专门被施加了魔法以抵抗普通、非魔法伤害的魔法书上，那么物质蒸发器是否会在其上失败？在这种情况下，答案可能是肯定的，尽管这可能会在书周围创造一个空腔，书会掉进去。",
	"{@book Cyphers|AotA|0|Cyphers} are similar to one-use magic items. In a game where Ancients' caches have opened, many of them might be available for PCs, who can carry only up to three at once before the danger associated with one person carrying too many at once kicks in.": "{@book Cyphers|AotA|0|Cyphers}类似于一次性魔法物品。在一个古代储藏室已经打开的游戏中，许多这样的物品可能会供PCs使用，他们一次只能携带最多三个，否则会有危险，因为一个人携带太多物品会引发危险。",
	"The idea is that characters should begin to trust that the availability of cyphers is high, allowing them to continually find and use them, without having to hoard. If they do, they might not get to use the next weird, new cypher that's found.": "角色应该开始相信密码的可用性很高，使他们能够不断地找到并使用它们，而不必囤积。如果他们这样做，他们可能就无法使用下一个奇怪的新密码了。",
	"But don't think about cyphers as a requirement for your game; they're a reward! Cyphers are a powerful tool for keeping gameplay fresh and exciting, because by their very nature, they're always changing. Cyphers = Excitement.": "但不要把密码视为游戏的必要条件；它们是一种奖励！密码是保持游戏新鲜和令人兴奋的强大工具，因为它们天生就在不断变化。密码 = 兴奋。",
	"Because they are essentially one-use abilities that characters gain and use over the course of the game, a character's capacity can change from session to session, which means the unexpected is always around the corner.": "因为它们基本上是角色在游戏过程中获得并使用的一次性能力，角色的能力可以在每个游戏会话中发生变化，这意味着意外总是在不远处。",
	"In game design for any system, one of the most difficult issues of game balance is introducing new PC abilities. It's not enough to think about what it will be like if a PC summons a {@creature callerail|AotA} once, you have to think about what effect it will have that the PC has the ability to summon callerails all the time. Maybe even every encounter. But cyphers, being one-use, don't cause this problem.": "在任何系统的游戏设计中，游戏平衡中最困难的问题之一是引入新的PC能力。仅仅考虑PC召唤一个{@creature callerail|AotA}的情况是不够的，你必须考虑到PC拥有一直召唤callerails的能力会产生什么影响。甚至可能是每次遭遇都会使用。但是，一次性使用的cyphers不会引起这个问题。",
	"Sure, a PC might end up with the ability to take down one really tough challenge with a wink or wave of a weird gizmo, but that's just one challenge of many that the group will face. It's fun, it's invigorating, but it's not unbalancing, because they'll very likely never find such a device again.": "当然，一个PC可能最终能够用一个奇怪装置的眨眼或挥手就解决一个非常棘手的挑战，但那只是许多挑战中的一个。这很有趣，令人振奋，但并不会破坏平衡，因为他们很可能再也找不到类似的装置了。",
	"Plus, cyphers are a way for a player to gain access to fun abilities without having to wait for months of game time to reach the level where it's appropriate for the PC to be able to use a higher-level ability.": "此外，(cyphers)是玩家在不必等待数月游戏时间达到PC可以使用更高级能力的级别时，就能获得有趣能力的一种方式。",
	"Each character has a limit on the number of cyphers they can carry at any given time. The idea is that cyphers are dangerous when gathered together. But this idea is actually only derived common wisdom, some of which might be based on incorrect observations. Although most cyphers are inherently unstable, will there be a terrible explosion if the dwarf gathers three cyphers in their fist at the same time? Probably not. Can a character tuck six pills into a pouch without dying of invisible poisoning? Almost certainly.": "每个角色在任何时候携带的密码数量都有限制。这个想法是当密码聚集在一起时会很危险。但这个想法实际上只是普遍的智慧，其中一些可能是基于不正确的观察。虽然大多数密码本质上是不稳定的，但如果矮人同时把三个密码聚集在拳头里，会发生可怕的爆炸吗？可能不会。一个角色能把六颗药丸塞进袋子里而不会死于隐形中毒吗？几乎可以肯定。",
	"The limit on cyphers is more of a gameplay mechanism than a setting or flavor issue. Basically, it's bad for the game if PCs hoard cyphers because they're meant to be used. Hoarding cyphers means there will be long stretches of the game without cypher use, and at some point, there probably will be a moment with far too much cypher use.": "对于符文限制更多是一种游戏机制，而不是一个设定或口味问题。基本上，如果玩家角色囤积符文，这对游戏是不利的，因为符文是用来使用的。囤积符文意味着游戏中会有很长一段时间没有使用符文，而在某个时刻，可能会出现过多的符文使用。",
	"Which is why the {@book cypher limit|AotA|0|cypher limit} exists, and the related {@table Cypher Danger Table|AotA}.": "这就是为什么存在{@book cypher limit|AotA|0|cypher limit}，以及相关的{@table Cypher Danger Table|AotA}。",
	"Here are some alternative ideas on how to limit cyphers and keep the same spirit of gameplay:": "这里有一些关于如何限制（cyphers）并保持游戏精神的替代想法：",
	"Give an expiration date to each cypher, citing their instability. However, that requires a lot of bookkeeping.": "为每个密码设定一个到期日期，引用它们的不稳定性。然而，这需要大量的簿记。(cypher)",
	"Characters who bear more than their cypher limit always act at disadvantage. This method is certainly simple.": "超过他们的密码限制的角色总是以劣势行动。这种方法确实很简单。",
	"The perils of having too many cyphers could be handled entirely through roleplaying, with characters acting out of caution and outright fear of something they know to be dangerous.": "拥有太多（%num%）(cyphers)的危险完全可以通过角色扮演来处理，角色会因为对危险的恐惧而谨慎行事。",
	"Just ignore all the weird cypher rules and treat cyphers like one-shot magic items.": "只需忽略所有奇怪的密码规则，将密码视为一次性魔法物品。",
	"The descriptions of the cyphers, relics, and other numenera items in this book include a default shape and sometimes material. However, these wonders of the Ancients can vary widely in appearance, for reasons lost to the epochs. The following sections allow a GM to quickly come up with an interesting and unique description for numenera items to keep each discovery new, weird, and mysterious; roll once on the {@table Device Shapes|AotA} options and once on the {@table Device Materials|AotA} options when PCs discover a device of the numenera.": "这本书中有关密码、遗物和其他“第九纪”物品的描述包括默认形状和有时材质。然而，这些古代奇迹的外观可能因时代的遗失而大不相同。以下部分允许GM快速想出一个有趣独特的描述来保持每个发现都是新奇、怪异和神秘的；当PCs发现一件“第九纪”装置时，在{@table Device Shapes|AotA}选项上投掷一次，在{@table Device Materials|AotA}选项上投掷一次。",
	"These entries describe the item in the most general, broad terms, and these should just be the baseline or quick description of the object, with the actual object looking more irregular and weird—something that generally looks like a cube might have some rounded edges, small spheres on each corner, and a handle extending from one face. Any of these shapes could be decorated with writing, etchings, grooves, ridges, knobs, buttons, unidentifiable lines, and so on. The names for some of these are the English names, and in truth, they are called by other names.": "这些条目描述物品的最一般、最广泛的术语，这些只应该是物体的基线或快速描述，实际物体看起来更加不规则和奇怪——一个通常看起来像一个立方体的东西可能有一些圆角，每个角上有小球，以及从一个面上延伸出来的手柄。这些形状中的任何一个都可以装饰有文字、刻痕、凹槽、脊线、旋钮、按钮、无法识别的线条等。其中一些的名称是英文名称，事实上，它们被称为其他名称。",
	"The {@table Device Materials|AotA|materials} on this table are offered as inspirations when you describe what a numenera device is made of. These entries describe the item's main material in the most general terms. Ancients' objects usually aren't made out of one type of material. A weapon might have a synth shell and a leather handle, but its core is probably a piece of metal or a crystal. A healing device might be an injectable liquid encased in a pouch or absorbed into a fungal pod. Most items include some kind of circuitry, controls, and perhaps even an illuminated display, which may be a very different material than the main device. In the same way that the GM quickly describes a vehicle as \"bright red, made of synth, with multiple wings,\" the players should understand that parts of the vehicle aren't red and aren't made of synth.": "当你描述奇物装置的材料时，这个表格上的{@table Device Materials|AotA|materials}可作为灵感。这些条目以最一般的术语描述物品的主要材料。古代人的物品通常不是由一种材料制成的。一把武器可能有合成外壳和皮革把手，但其核心可能是一块金属或水晶。一个治疗装置可能是一个被封装在袋子里或被吸收到真菌荚中的可注射液体。大多数物品包括某种电路、控制装置，甚至可能有一个发光显示屏，这可能是与主要装置完全不同的材料。就像GM迅速描述一辆车为“鲜红色，由合成材料制成，带有多个机翼”一样，玩家应该明白车辆的部分并不是红色的，也不是由合成材料制成的。",
	"If you need an object AC for one of the options provided on the materials table, the default is AC 15, even for things that may seem like they should be less, like a leaf or a mushroom; these materials are not {@i actually} those things, they are merely akin to them.": "如果你需要一个物体的AC，可以在材料表上提供的选项中选择，默认值为AC 15，即使对于看起来应该更低的物体，比如叶子或蘑菇；这些材料并不是{@i actually}这些东西，它们只是类似于它们。",
	"Sometimes, a device is described as metallic, glass, or crystal, in which case regular object statistics apply, including the appropriate object AC. Other times, it's not clear what substance a numenera device is crafted from because it is a completely manufactured material. The catch-all term for such material is \"synth.\" But if a PC wants to saw through a synth tube, shatter a synth canister, or smash a device of synth that opens a portal into a previously curled-up dimension, they need to know its object AC.": "有时，设备被描述为金属、玻璃或水晶，这种情况下适用普通物体的统计数据，包括适当的物体AC。但有时候不清楚奇物设备是由什么物质制成的，因为它是完全人造的材料。这种材料的通用术语是“合成物”(synth)。但如果一名PC想要锯开一个合成物管道、粉碎一个合成物容器，或者砸碎一个由合成物制成的设备，打开通往之前卷曲维度的传送门，他们需要知道它的物体AC。",
	"{@b Synth AC:} 16 (unless otherwise noted in a particular object description)": "{@b Synth AC:} 16（除非在特定物品描述中另有说明）",
	"The nature of the return of the Ancients, and the basis for much of their incomprehensible technology, relates to the subtle manipulation of tiny, previously inaccessible alternate planes of existence and limited dimensions not previously recognized as being part of the normal cosmology. If you want to play with that concept more than simply use it as an interesting bit of lore, you can introduce the concept of rifts into your game as PCs use the strange cyphers, relics, and iron flesh that they find.": "古代人回归的本质，以及他们许多难以理解的技术基础，与微妙地操纵微小的、以前无法接触的替代存在平面以及先前未被认为是正常宇宙学一部分的有限维度有关。如果你想更多地探索这个概念，而不仅仅将其用作有趣的传说片段，你可以在游戏中引入裂缝的概念，玩家角色使用他们发现的奇怪密码、遗物和铁质肉体。",
	"When a relic depletes, it usually just stops working. The same is true of a cypher. If a cypher or relic becomes damaged, it might also stop working. But you have the option to decide that a mishap occurs under such circumstances, creating an accidental rift.": "当一件遗物耗尽时，通常会停止起作用。同样的情况也适用于一个秘文。如果一个秘文或遗物受损，它也可能停止起作用。但在这种情况下，你可以选择发生意外事故，造成一个意外的裂缝。",
	"To check for a rift when a relic depletes, or merely when you judge the situation might cause a chance for a rift to occur, the player makes a rift saving throw. If the roll is 10 or higher, the PC succeeds. Otherwise, they fail. On a failed rift saving throw, a rift event occurs.": "当一个遗物耗尽时，或者当你判断情况可能导致裂隙发生时，玩家需要进行一次裂隙豁免投掷。如果投掷结果为10或更高，玩家成功。否则，他们失败。在失败的裂隙豁免投掷中，裂隙事件发生。",
	"Rift events could include any of the mishaps indicated on the {@table Rift Table|AotA}.": "裂隙事件可能包括{@table Rift Table|AotA}上指示的任何意外。",
	"If the worst should happen, a rip in reality can create a permanent rift. This might lead to another part of the world, to another plane of existence, or have a more subtle, dimensional scrambling effect. If a dimensional scrambling effect occurs, all creatures within a 1-mile-radius sphere centered on the rift—creatures, objects, structures, and so on, including itself—begin to non-destructively merge with an alternate dimension chosen by the GM.": "如果最糟糕的情况发生，现实中的一道裂缝可能会造成一个永久性的裂隙。这可能会导致前往世界的另一个部分，到另一个存在平面，或产生更微妙的、维度混乱的效应。如果发生维度混乱的效应，裂隙中心半径为1英里的球形范围内的所有生物、物体、结构等，包括裂隙本身，在游戏主持人选择的另一个维度中开始非破坏性地融合。",
	"This has the effect of creating a wide overlapping zone where things from two dimensions occupy the same area. The mixed environment could run the gamut from placid coexistence to a burned-out dead rift, depending on the nature of the two dimensions that come together. Creatures outside the affected rift in either of the linked dimensions can enter the other dimension if they walk across the affected area from one side to the other. Once the rift is created, undoing it would require extraordinary resources.": "这会导致一个广泛的重叠区域，两个维度的事物占据同一区域。混合环境可能从平静共存到烧毁的死亡裂缝，取决于两个维度的性质。在连接维度中的受影响裂缝之外的生物可以穿过受影响区域从一侧进入另一维度。一旦裂缝形成，要消除它将需要非同寻常的资源。",
	"As PCs gain familiarity with the return of the Ancients, they have the option to develop a talent or gain expertise with the numenera. In other words, you can choose to give characters access to a few new feats.": "当角色熟悉古代文明的回归时，他们可以选择发展一项天赋或在奇物上获得专长。换句话说，你可以选择让角色获得一些新的特技。",
	"{@book Chapter 3|AotA|0|Mutations} describes a variety of {@book mutations|AotA|0|Mutations} a player character might gain due to the ineffable energies and biomorphic substances leaking from Ancients devices and suffusing the ruins. An option for {@book beginning play as a mutant|AotA|0|beginning play as a mutant} is outlined.

	"You could handle the situation using one (or both) of the following options.": "您可以使用以下一个（或两个）选项来处理这种情况。",
	"First, you could be completely arbitrary in what happens when characters enter an area you've decided puts them at risk of gaining a mutation. In this case, have them each make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a success, they only feel nauseated for an hour, and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks during that period.": "首先，当角色进入你决定会让他们有可能获得变异的区域时，你可以完全随意决定发生什么。在这种情况下，让他们每人进行一次 DC 15的体质豁免检定。成功的话，他们只会感到恶心一小时，并在此期间攻击检定和技能检定都有劣势。",
	"On a failure, they gain a mutation. Roll on the following {@table random mutation table|AotA} to see what kind of mutation each PC gains. The mutations fully develop over the course of four hours, during which time the character is incapacitated.": "失败时，他们会获得一种变异。在以下{@table random mutation table|AotA}上投掷骰子，以查看每个PC获得的变异类型。这些变异会在四个小时内完全发展，角色在此期间将无法行动。",
	"Once gained, a mutation is permanent, though in-game developments might offer a character a way to ameliorate or reverse a harmful mutation.": "一旦获得，突变就是永久的，尽管游戏内的发展可能会为角色提供改善或逆转有害突变的方法。",
	"A character could potentially develop multiple mutations in this fashion; however, they can never gain more than one powerful mutation at a time, or more than four total mutations at a time.": "一个角色可能以这种方式潜在地发展多种变异；然而，他们一次永远不能获得超过一个强大变异，或者同时获得超过四种总变异。",
	"Even if characters stumble into a mutation by accident, you could allow them to gain some control over the condition once they have some experience with it. The easiest way to do that is to treat that control as the acquisition of a feat.": "即使角色偶然陷入变异状态，一旦他们对此有了一些经验，你可以允许他们对该状态获得一定程度的控制。最简单的方法是将这种控制视为获得一个专长（feat）的过程。",
	"At certain levels, a character's class provides an Ability Score Improvement feature. Instead of gaining that benefit, a character could gain better control over their mutation by gaining the benefit outlined for beginning play as a mutant, with the following caveat.

	"You may want to locate Ancients' caches in mysterious, isolated wastelands. Such places might have a reputation as cursed, forbidden, and utterly dangerous, where the very air is filled with sickness and death. We'll call these locations wastelands. And true to the legends, they are dangerous, but not because of magical curses, but because of the Ancients' actions in the unimaginably far past.": "你可能想要在神秘、孤立的荒地中寻找古代人的隐藏宝藏。这些地方可能被认为是被诅咒、禁忌和极度危险的，那里的空气充满了疾病和死亡。我们将这些地点称为荒地。与传说一样，它们是危险的，但不是因为魔法诅咒，而是因为古代人在遥远的过去所做的行动。",
	"The Ancient's devices have perhaps become degraded over time through various processes of decomposition and rot, unforeseen interactions, environment, and even unexpected activity of vermin or other creatures. Untended and left to fester, such areas can become a stew of dangerous energies, poisonous substances, disease-producing minerals, corrupt liquids, and materials so weirdly dangerous that understanding exactly how they are warping one's body or mind is difficult for someone who doesn't understand the Ancients' inexplicable technology.": "古代人的装置可能随着时间的推移而逐渐恶化，经历了各种腐烂、意想不到的相互作用、环境影响，甚至是害虫或其他生物的意外活动。若不加理会任由其腐烂，这些地区可能会变成危险能量、有毒物质、产生疾病的矿物质、腐化液体以及材料的混合物，这些材料异常危险，以至于即使是不懂古代人莫名技术的人也很难理解它们究竟是如何扭曲一个人的身体或思维的。",
	"Independently or in small quantities, these eroded materials have little value to scavengers. But some are especially dangerous. This section describes many examples of such sites, which the GM can place near, around, or within sites already associated with the Ancients.": "这些被侵蚀的材料独立或少量存在时，对清道夫来说价值不大。但有些尤其危险。本节描述了许多这样的场所示例，GM可以将其放置在与古代人有关的地点附近、周围或内部。",

	"The hot zone of a defunct Ancients automaton that ceased working aeons ago might be as small as 10 feet across, but the residue from an ancient structure where highly volatile exotic substances have been leeching might be 100 feet or more across. Beyond the hot zone is the \"warm zone,\" an area two to three times the diameter of the hot zone, where the material is more scattered and isn't quite as dangerous. For example, if the hot zone is 60 feet across, the warm zone extends at least another 60 feet beyond that, forming a somewhat irregular ring, or whatever border that makes sense given the source of the contamination. Other planes of existence could be similarly contaminated; a site contaminated with extradimensional technology might have a normal hot zone and a warm zone that bleeds over into adjacent dimensions. The zones usually extend up into the air and down into the ground about one-third to one-half of the zone's horizontal space.": "一个废弃的远古自动装置的热区，可能在数百年前停止运作，可能只有10英尺大小，但在古代建筑遗迹中，高度挥发的异质物质一直在渗透，其残留物可能达到100英尺甚至更大。热区之外是“温暖区”，是热区直径的两到三倍大小，物质更为分散，危险程度也相对较低。例如，如果热区直径为60英尺，温暖区至少延伸另外60英尺，形成一个略微不规则的环形，或者根据污染源合理设定边界。其他存在平面可能同样受到污染；一个被超维科技污染的地点可能有一个正常的热区和一个温暖区，渗入相邻维度。这些区域通常向上延伸到空中，向下延伸到地面，大约是水平空间的三分之一到一半。",
	"Every hour a creature spends in a hot zone, it must succeed on a saving throw (usually Constitution) or suffer a harmful effect from the contamination there. The warm zone is safer, but still dangerous, and a creature must make a saving throw if they spend at least five hours there.": "每小时生物在炎热区域内的时间，都必须进行一次豁免投掷（通常是体质检定），否则会受到那里污染的有害影响。温暖区域相对较安全，但仍然危险，如果生物在那里至少停留五个小时，也必须进行一次豁免投掷。",

	"For variety, the GM should choose a different origin for the negative wasteland effects—poison, disease, thunder, lightning, chemical reaction, extradimensional, temporal, parasites, piercing nanomachines, and so on. This allows some PCs with special resistances a better chance against hazards, and it keeps the exact nature of each site unpredictable.": "为了增加变化，GM应该为负面荒地效应选择不同的起源——毒药、疾病、雷霆、闪电、化学反应、超维、时间、寄生虫、穿刺纳米机器等等。这样一来，一些具有特殊抗性的PC有更好的机会抵御危险，并且保持每个地点的确切性质不可预测。",

	"An underlying assumption regarding the Ancients is that an inconceivable amount of time has passed since they've been around, and moreover, when they were around, they were active on and off for millions of years. This itself is almost impossible for anyone to truly grasp. It's deep time, and during the course of deep time, nothing remains constant. Add in the rise and fall of the Ancients (composed of civilizations so great that they are nigh incomprehensible), and anything is possible.": "对于古人的一个基本假设是，自从他们存在以来已经过去了难以想象的长时间，而且当他们存在时，他们活跃了数百万年，这本身几乎是不可能为任何人所真正理解的。这是深层时间，在深层时间的过程中，没有什么是恒定不变的。再加上古人的兴衰（由如此伟大以至于难以理解的文明组成），任何事情都是可能的。",
	"Which is why a brand-new science-fantasy campaign using this material that posts the existence of Ancients should embrace a perspective of change.": "这就是为什么一个全新的科幻奇幻战役，使用这些资料，公布了远古者的存在，应该拥抱变革的观点。",
	"When attempting to grasp what such a campaign would look like, keep in mind two complementary shaping forces. First, the previously mentioned vast amount of time. Imagine if you were to set your campaign on Earth. If Earth were left completely alone for this long, the drastic changes of celestial mechanics, continental drift, erosion, mass extinction, and evolution would render our home unrecognizable.": "在试图理解这样一场战役会是什么样子时，请记住两个互补的塑造力量。首先是之前提到的大量时间。想象一下，如果你将你的战役设定在地球上。如果地球在这么长时间里完全被忽视，天体力学、板块漂移、侵蚀、物种大灭绝和进化的剧烈变化将使我们的家园变得面目全非。",
	"Second, is that of intelligence. Over such a span of time, there might not have been only a single monoculture. Though described as the Ancients, these entities are perhaps composed of many civilizations that rose (or arrived), flourished, and advanced to incredible power. Then they either declined or left, never to return, except in the form of leftovers, refuse, and prizes in their caches.": "其次，是智慧的问题。在如此漫长的时间跨度内，可能并非只有一个单一的文化。尽管被描述为“古代人”，这些实体也许由许多兴起（或到来）、繁荣并发展到令人难以置信的力量的文明组成。然后它们要么衰落，要么离开，永不返回，除非以遗留物、废料和宝藏的形式出现在它们的隐藏地中。",
	"This is really more about setting expectations than about laying hard and fast rules. But here are a few precepts you might use to undergird your own brand-new science-fantasy Ancients-related campaign. One or more of them could be true, particularly if we assume that there were multiple civilizations of \"Ancients.\"": "这更多是关于设定期望而不是制定严格规则。但以下是一些原则，你可以用来支持你自己全新的科幻古代（(Ancients)）相关战役。其中一个或多个可能是真实的，特别是如果我们假设存在多个“古代文明”。",
	"The Ancients' civilization lay at the center of a galactic (or perhaps intergalactic) space-faring empire.": "古老文明位于一个银河（或许是跨银河）太空帝国的中心。",
	"The Ancients wielded the power of planetary engineering and stellar lifting.": "古老者掌握着行星工程和恒星提升的力量。",
	"The Ancients had knowledge of the fundamental forces of reality and could alter those forces as they wished. The very laws of physics were theirs to play with, like toys. This likely strayed somewhat into magic, even if the Ancients never saw it as such.": "古人掌握着现实的基本力量，并可以随心所欲地改变这些力量。物理定律就像他们随意玩耍的玩具一样。即使古人从未将其视为魔法，这种能力很可能有些偏离了物理定律。",
	"The Ancients filled the world with invisible, molecule-sized machines called nanites (or nanomachines) that could deconstruct and reconstruct matter and manipulate energy. (Is this what magic really is? Your answer may differ based on where you want your new campaign to go.)": "古代人用称为纳米机器（或纳米机器人）的微小分子机器充满了世界，这些机器可以解构和重构物质，操纵能量。（这就是魔法的真正本质吗？根据你希望新战役发展的方向，你的答案可能会有所不同。）",
	"The Ancients explored the multiverse of other dimensions, parallel universes, and alternate levels of reality.": "古老者探索了其他维度的多元宇宙，平行宇宙和替代现实层次。",
	"At least some of the Ancients were not humanoid.": "至少一些远古生物不是人形生物。",
	"In your science-fantasy campaign setting, is it common knowledge that the Ancients existed, or is it a secret, only just now being discovered—perhaps by the PCs? While the default assumption of this book is the latter, you could certainly create a setting like the former. Terry Brook's classic fantasy {@i The Sword of Shannara} is built on that premise.": "在你的科幻奇幻战役设定中，古代人的存在是众所周知的，还是一个秘密，只是最近才被发现的——也许是由玩家角色发现的？尽管本书的默认假设是后者，你当然可以创建一个类似前者的设定。特里·布鲁克斯经典奇幻小说《{@i The Sword of Shannara}》就是建立在这个前提之上。",
	"In a campaign where the Ancients are known to some or maybe even most, stories and legends of their existence would likely be mixed in with the myths of gods and demons typical to a fantasy setting. Locations where caches or remnants of the Ancients' work might be seen as holy sites, cursed locales, or forbidden \"no man's lands.\"": "在一个设定中，古代人被一些人甚至大多数人所知晓，关于他们存在的故事和传说很可能会与典型的幻想设定中的神祇和恶魔的神话混合在一起。古代人的遗物或遗迹可能被视为圣地、诅咒之地或禁忌的“无人之地”。",
	"From time to time, in such a setting, cyphers or other numenera items would find their way into treasure hoards or into the hands of rich or powerful NPCs. Perhaps the evil wizard has a relic that allows him to defy gravity. Perhaps an ancient dragon has some iron flesh enhancements, mutations, or both.": "在这样的情境中，偶尔会有密码或其他（%num%）奇物出现在宝藏中，或者落入富有或强大的NPC手中。也许邪恶的巫师拥有一件能让他违抗重力的遗物。也许一条古老的龙拥有一些铁质肉体增强、突变，或两者兼有。",
	"Where does your new science-fantasy campaign take place? Many science-fantasies are sited on Earth in the very far future, after a singularity or other technological advance has occurred that eclipses modern understanding. Alternatively, you could take an existing fantasy setting (one of your own creation, one from your favorite fantasy fiction, or one produced to be a campaign setting) and change things so that the Ancients and their technology are assumed to exist.": "你的新科幻奇幻战役发生在哪里？许多科幻奇幻故事发生在地球上，时间是遥远的未来，在一个奇点或其他技术进步发生后，超越了现代的理解。或者，你可以选择一个现有的幻想世界（可以是你自己创作的，也可以是你最喜欢的幻想小说中的一个，或者是一个专门为战役设置而制作的）并改变一些设定，让“先古人”及其技术被假定存在。",
	"If you decide to use the modern world but set some time in the far future, you have the luxury of re-arranging things to demonstrate massive energies were used in the past to re-engineer the planet. For instance, maybe most of the land mass has been formed into a gigantic supercontinent, leaving the rest of the globe to the mercy of a single ocean dotted with islands. In addition to the moon appearing smaller than in the modern era because its orbit is wider, it might be built up with visible structures that glow with millions of lights. If enough time has passed from the modern era to the time when you set your campaign, a day will be a few hours longer than 24. And so on.": "如果你决定使用现代世界，但设定在遥远的未来，你有奢侈的机会重新安排事物，以展示过去曾经使用了巨大的能量来重新改造这个星球。例如，也许大部分陆地已经形成了一个巨大的超级大陆，剩下的地球表面则被一片充满小岛的单一海洋所覆盖。除此之外，由于月球的轨道更广，所以在未来的世界中看起来比现代小一些，它可能会被建造成可见的结构，散发着数百万的光芒。如果从现代时代到你设定的战役时间经过了足够长的时间，一天将会比24小时长几个小时。等等。",
	"You could decide to site your campaign someplace else, or even somewhere completely artificial, though this might not be immediately realized by players. A few options, among many possibilities, are:": "你可以决定将你的冒险设定在其他地方，甚至是完全虚构的地方，尽管玩家可能不会立刻意识到这一点。一些选择，还有许多可能性，包括：",
	"On a terraformed moon of another planet in the solar system.": "在太阳系另一个行星的被改造的卫星上。",
	"In a generation starship moving through deep space, so large that residents don't understand they don't live on a planet.": "在一艘穿越深空的世代星舰中，它如此巨大，居民们甚至不明白他们并不生活在一个行星上。",
	"On an artificial megastructure like a Dyson Sphere, a Ringworld, or an Alderson Disk.": "在类似戴森球、环世界或奥尔德森盘这样的人工巨型结构上。",
	"In a virtual reality environment, where nearly anything might be possible, until the glitches set in.": "在一个虚拟现实环境中，几乎任何事情都可能发生，直到出现故障。",
	"On a world orbiting another star originally colonized by space travel, the knowledge of which has since been lost.": "在另一颗恒星周围轨道运行的世界上，最初是通过太空旅行殖民的，但后来这段历史被遗忘了。",
	"In the cracks of a massive alien machine whose purpose isn't understood.": "在一台巨大的外星机器的裂缝中，其目的尚不为人所知。",
	"On a traditional fantasy world where technologically advanced entities have recently made themselves known.": "在一个传统的奇幻世界中，最近出现了技术先进的实体。",
	"The people and creatures you populate your brand-new campaign with are probably ignorant of the true history of the world, with some exceptions. That's because to be a science-{@i fantasy}, knowledge is lost, and history becomes mythology. In other words, the relics of the Ancients are just that—no one in the modern times of the setting is producing these kinds of devices. People use whatever cobbled resources they can pull from the detritus of an earlier science-enriched (or science-devastated) world, but they can't make new things or even truly understand the principles behind what they find.": "你在全新的战役中创造的人物和生物可能对世界的真实历史一无所知，除了一些例外。这是因为在{@i fantasy}的情况下，知识被遗忘，历史变成了神话。换句话说，古代人的遗物就是那样——在设定的现代时代，没有人在生产这类设备。人们利用他们能从早期科学丰富（或科学毁灭）的世界的废墟中找到的任何拼凑资源，但他们无法制造新东西，甚至无法真正理解他们发现的事物背后的原理。",
	"All of which is to say that your player characters probably have a basic medieval understanding of the world. They won't immediately realize that the wonders around them are not the result of magic, meddling gods, and curses, but perhaps the fallout of an age where mastery of knowledge and tools put people on par with deities.": "所有这些都是为了说明你的玩家角色可能对世界有着基本的中世纪理解。他们不会立即意识到周围的奇迹并非是魔法、干预的神灵和诅咒的结果，而可能是知识和工具的掌握让人类与神明处于同等地位的时代的后遗症。",
	"The basic conflict of a science-fantasy setting is that there are undiscovered places that cry out for exploration. Why is the setting the way it is? Is there any record of what happened that can be found or pieced together? And if some kind of lingering danger persists in the world, is there a means lost in some high-technology ruin that can ameliorate it?": "在一个科幻奇幻（science-fantasy）背景中，基本冲突在于存在着呼唤探索的未知地方。这个设定为什么会是这样？有没有任何记录可以找到或拼凑在一起，来解释发生了什么？如果世界上仍然存在某种潜在危险，是否有一种在某个高科技废墟中遗失的方法可以缓解它？",
	"Here are a few specific conflicts, out of a limitless number that are possible, that you can throw at your players.": "这里有一些具体的冲突，其中有无限可能性，你可以向你的玩家提出。",

	"A flying structure of unknown provenance, apparently adrift and powerless, plows into an inhabited area, and rescue of survivors becomes an issue, but strange creatures/objects are coming out of the structure.": "一座来源不明的飞行结构，显然是漂泊无力的，撞进了一个有人居住的区域，营救幸存者成为一个问题，但是奇怪的生物/物体正在这个结构中出现。",
	"A sage offers a mighty reward to the first person to bring them a relic from the Tomb of the Machine.": "一位智者向第一个带给他机械之墓遗物的人提供丰厚的奖励。",
	"An NPC puts on a gleaming set of whirring armor, gaining amazing new abilities, but uses them to become a warlord.": "一个NPC穿上一套闪闪发光、发出嗡嗡声的盔甲，获得了惊人的新能力，但却利用这些能力成为了一个军阀。",
	"A curse or sickness brought up out of a ruin slowly petrifies people into reddish crystal images of themselves, humming with beautiful music.": "一种诅咒或疾病从废墟中产生，慢慢地将人们变成他们自己的红色水晶图像，发出美妙的音乐。",
	"A strange device can create machine duplicates of anyone that gets too near, even duplicates of other duplicates, creating a growing city of similar beings that continues to swell.": "一个奇怪的装置可以复制任何靠近它的人，甚至是其他复制品的复制品，从而创造出一个不断膨胀的相似生物城市。",
	"Strange creatures with odd devices are moving into the area. There have been a few skirmishes. Will there be peace or war?": "奇怪的生物带着奇怪的装置进入了这个地区。已经发生了几次小规模冲突。会是和平还是战争？",
	"NPCs that commonly tunnel and mine below the earth discover a massive Ancients device, which they decide to wake and try and use as a weapon against their ancestral foes, against whom they nurture a long-standing grudge.": "那些经常在地下挖掘和开采的NPC们发现了一台巨大的远古装置，他们决定唤醒并尝试将其用作武器对抗他们祖先的敌人，对这些敌人他们怀有长期的仇恨。",
	"Weird storms that come complete with energy creatures roll down from the oddly angular mountains every few years. When people are attacked by the energy creatures, afterward they have memories they didn't previously, usually of a distant gate that creaks ominously open, a few inches more each year.": "每隔几年，伴随着能量生物的奇怪风暴从那些奇怪角度的山脉中滚滚而来。当人们被这些能量生物攻击后，他们会突然拥有之前没有的记忆，通常是一个遥远的大门，每年都会嘎吱作响地缓缓打开几英寸。",
	"Colossal constructs begin tearing apart the land, sending massive chunks into the sky using newly assembled towers that reach to the heavens. Will they stop, or will they go on until the entire land is disassembled?": "巨大的建筑物开始撕裂大地，利用新组装的通往天空的高塔将巨大的块状物送入天空。它们会停下来吗，还是会继续，直到整个土地被拆解？",
	"A being from a heretofore unknown plane of existence appears, quickly gaining the reputation of a prophet of doom. It warns that danger approaches from a direction that no one can see, and that to protect against it, people must unite and build a strange machine under its specific direction.": "一个来自一个迄今未知的存在平面的生物出现了，迅速获得了一个末日预言者的声誉。它警告说危险来自一个没有人能看到的方向，为了防范，人们必须团结起来，按照它的具体指示建造一台奇怪的机器。",
	"A region of temporal anomalies begins to spread, possibly because of a fracture in a vast device that hums and shudders deep underground.": "一个时间异常区域开始蔓延，可能是因为地下深处一个巨大装置发生了裂缝，发出低沉而颤抖的声音。",
	"The numenera is weird. Purposefully so; all the lore and understanding that traditionally accompanies the presentation of a particular creature or location—including its history, motives understandable by humanlevel intelligences, and a sense that what is seen is base reality—isn't usually the case when it comes to the numenera. A PC may never know why a {@creature philethis|AotA} appeared to it one day to warn them of an impending event, or even if the event is something that already happened epochs earlier.": "奇物{@creature philethis|AotA}是奇怪的。这是有意为之的；传统上伴随着特定生物或地点的展示的所有知识和理解——包括其历史、人类智能可以理解的动机，以及所看到的是基本现实的感觉——在涉及奇物时通常不适用。一个角色可能永远不知道为什么一天奇物突然出现警告他们即将发生的事件，甚至这个事件是否已经在很久以前发生过。",
	"Which is why we've assembled several additional suggestions, guidelines, and even some robust tables to further help incorporate these concepts into your existing or brand-new 5E campaign.": "这就是为什么我们汇集了一些额外的建议、指南，甚至一些强大的表格，以帮助将这些概念进一步融入您现有或全新的5E战役中。",
	"{@book Arcana of the Ancients|AotA} introduces a couple of additional mechanics to a 5E game for use with cyphers (you can only carry so many at a time) and relics (depletion rolls). If you're interested in trying another new twist, one you can use to tweak the narrative, try GM intrusions.": "{@book Arcana of the Ancients|AotA} 为 5E 游戏引入了一些额外的机制，用于与密码（您一次只能携带这么多）和文物（耗尽检定）一起使用。如果您有兴趣尝试另一种新的变化，一种可以用来调整叙事的方式，请尝试GM干预。",
	"At any time, the GM can introduce an unexpected complication for a character—this is called a GM intrusion. When a GM intrudes in this manner, they must give that character 2 inspiration. That player, in turn, must immediately give one of those inspiration to another player and justify the gift (perhaps the other player had a good idea, told a funny joke, performed an action that saved a life, and so on).": "在任何时候，GM可以为角色引入一个意外的复杂情节—这被称为GM干预。当GM以这种方式干预时，他们必须给予该角色2点灵感。而那个玩家必须立即将其中一点灵感转交给另一个玩家，并解释这个礼物的理由（也许另一个玩家有一个好主意，讲了一个有趣的笑话，执行了一个拯救生命的行动等等）。",
	"Often, the GM intrudes when a player attempts an action that, according to the rules, should be an automatic success. However, the GM is free to intrude at other times. As a general rule, the GM should intrude at least once each session, but no more than once or twice each session per character.": "通常情况下，当玩家尝试一项根据规则应该是自动成功的动作时，(%num%)主持人会插手干预。然而，(%num%)主持人也可以在其他时候插手干预。一般来说，(%num%)主持人应该每场景至少干预一次，但每个角色每场景不应超过一到两次。",
	"Anytime the GM intrudes, the player can spend 1 inspiration to refuse the intrusion, though that also means they don't get the 2 inspiration. If the player has no inspiration to spend, they can't refuse the intrusion.": "每当主持人干预时，玩家可以花费1点灵感来拒绝干预，尽管这也意味着他们不会得到2点灵感。如果玩家没有可用的灵感来花费，他们就无法拒绝干预。",
	"Finally, as is normally the case, players can't keep more than 1 inspiration between game sessions.": "最后，与通常情况一样，玩家在游戏间不能保留超过1点灵感。",
	"Through skill and the aid of another character, a character seems likely to easily scale a wall. But the GM intrudes and says, \"Just as you're about to reach the top, a bit of the crumbling wall gives way.\" This requires that the PC make a Dexterity saving throw or fall. But because the GM intruded, the character gains 2 inspiration. They immediately give one of those inspiration to another player.": "通过技能和另一名角色的帮助，一个角色似乎很容易就能爬上墙。但是GM插话说：“就在你快要到达顶部时，一小块破碎的墙壁塌了下来。”这要求玩家进行一次敏捷豁免检定，否则就会摔下来。但由于GM的干涉，角色获得了2点灵感。他们立即将其中一点灵感转交给另一名玩家。",
	"During a fight, a PC swings their axe and damages a foe with a slice across the shoulder. The GM intrudes by saying that the foe turned just as the axe struck, wrenching the weapon from the character's grip and sending it clattering across the floor. Because the GM intruded, the PC gains 2 inspiration, and they immediately give one of those inspiration to another player. Now the character must deal with the dropped weapon, perhaps drawing a different weapon or using their next turn to scramble after the axe.": "在一场战斗中，一名玩家角色挥动斧头，对敌人的肩膀斩击造成伤害。GM 介入并说敌人在斧头击中时转身，从角色手中将武器拧出，并将其摔落在地板上。由于 GM 的介入，玩家角色获得 2 灵感，并立即将其中一点灵感转交给另一名玩家。现在角色必须处理掉落的武器，也许拔出另一把武器，或者利用下一个回合去追逐那把斧头。",
	"As we stated earlier, some material in this book originally appeared in the standalone science-fantasy RPG, Numenera. Converting between two different game systems isn't always straightforward. Hundreds of decisions were made on how a particular Numenera ability or effect—which uses the Cypher System as an underlying rule system—should appear in a 5E context. Lots of information is implicitly coded into a Cypher System level that helps a GM handle all kinds of different situations, should any question arise.": "正如我们之前所述，本书中的一些材料最初出现在独立的科幻奇幻RPG《第九纪元》(Numenera)中。在两种不同的游戏系统之间进行转换并不总是直截了当的。在如何将特定的《第九纪元》能力或效果——它使用Cypher系统作为基础规则系统——呈现在5E环境中的问题上，我们做出了数百个决策。大量信息被隐式编码到了一个Cypher系统级别中，这有助于GM处理各种不同情况，以防有任何问题出现。",
	"The 5E ruleset relies on similar predictive qualities, of course, but it delivers that game information to the GM and players differently, using a formal and in-depth method. In a 5E game, you can't get away with introducing a brand-new NPC and simply giving them a level, or assigning a level to an effect or area, and having that dictate an array of basic parameters.": "5E规则集当然也依赖于类似的预测性质，但它以一种正式而深入的方式将游戏信息传达给GM和玩家。在一场5E游戏中，你不能只是引入一个全新的NPC并简单地给他们一个等级，或者给一个效果或区域分配一个等级，然后让这个等级决定一系列基本参数。",
	"Specific statistics—usually called stat blocks—are expected for each creature and NPC in the 5E ruleset. The stat blocks provide essential information that can't be gleaned simply by checking the monster's challenge (though that's a great start). All questions about DCs, effect ranges and areas, hit points, specific stats, and more are present in every 5E monster's entry. If your players run into a {@creature progenitor|AotA}, as the GM you not only expect to see the monster's stat block, but also the stat block for the progenitor's spawn that might burst from the egg sack bulging on the monster's belly.": "在第五版规则集中，每个生物和NPC都需要具有特定的统计数据，通常称为属性块。这些属性块提供了一些基本信息，仅通过检查怪物的挑战等级是无法获得的（尽管这是一个很好的起点）。每个第五版怪物的条目中都包含有关DCs、效果范围和区域、生命值、具体属性等等的所有问题。如果你的玩家遇到了一个{@creature progenitor|AotA}，作为GM，你不仅希望看到怪物的属性块，还希望看到可能从怪物肚子上鼓起的卵囊中爆发出来的原生者的属性块。",
	"A similar situation holds true for special objects such as magic items. \"Magic\" isn't what the Ancients relied upon to achieve their wondrous abilities, though the principle is similar enough that certain especially powerful Ancients creatures are {@footnote treated as if magical|More on the topic of treating some powerful numenera creatures and objects as if magical is discussed under {@book Magic vs. the Ancients|AotA|1|Magic vs. the Ancients}} as the default for inclusion in a 5E game.": "对于特殊物品如魔法物品，也适用类似的情况。 “魔法”并非古代人依赖的能力来源，尽管原理相似到足以使得某些特别强大的古代生物作为第五版游戏中默认包含的{@footnote treated as if magical|More on the topic of treating some powerful numenera creatures and objects as if magical is discussed under {@book Magic vs. the Ancients|AotA|1|Magic vs. the Ancients}。",
	"Likewise, the remnants of their works—primarily in the form of {@book cyphers, relics, and iron flesh|AotA|0|Chapter 3: Cyphers, Relics, and Iron Flesh}—are in effect equally \"magical.\" That's especially true for ingame characters who find a relic, maybe an {@item endless stomach|AotA}, that allows them to eat anything they can put in their mouth, or a {@item mind imager|AotA} cypher, which when attached to someone's heads, shows images of what they're thinking. All of which is to say that the entries for cyphers, relics, and iron flesh use a similar format as 5E magic items, with a few exceptions described in that chapter.": "同样，他们作品的残余——主要以{@book cyphers, relics, and iron flesh|AotA|0|Chapter 3: Cyphers, Relics, and Iron Flesh}的形式存在——实际上同样具有\"魔力\"。对于游戏角色而言尤其如此，他们可能会找到一件遗物，比如一个{@item endless stomach|AotA}，让他们可以吃下任何能放进嘴里的东西，或者一个{@item mind imager|AotA}的密码，当附着在某人的头上时，会显示出他们在想什么的图像。所有这些都是为了说明，密码、遗物和铁皮的条目使用与5E魔法物品类似的格式，其中在该章节中描述了一些例外情况。",
	"For GMs who prefer a more traditional randomization based on rarity, this appendix separates the {@book cyphers, relics, and iron flesh|AotA|0|Chapter 3: Cyphers, Relics, and Iron Flesh} into nine different tables (A through I) arranged by rarity.": "对于更喜欢基于稀有度的传统随机化的GM们，这个附录将{@book cyphers, relics, and iron flesh|AotA|0|Chapter 3: Cyphers, Relics, and Iron Flesh}分成了九个不同的表格（A至I），按稀有度排列。",
	"The Hills of Crooked Sleep is an adventure intended to introduce material from Arcana of the Ancients to your 5E game.": "《弯曲睡眠之丘》是一次冒险，旨在将《(Arcana of the Ancients)古代奥秘》中的内容引入到你的第五版游戏中。",

You recover these hit points at a rate of {@dice 1d8} per round, and you must use your action each round and maintain concentration; if you are interrupted, the healing ends. This completely drains the device, even if interrupted before you're finished (at the GM's discretion, an item may retain some charges or only have to make a depletion roll if partially drained).

The GM can customize them by adjusting size, stats, specifying what form its attacks take (claws, slams, and so on), adding manufactured weapons (swords, rays, or even cyphers or relics), different movement modes, skill bonuses, or even a special ability. These changes should be limited so the GM doesn't have to adjust the automaton's challenge rating. For example, the basic automaton's listed melee attack method is just called \"melee attack\"; it doesn't matter if that's a claw, drill, or blade, and the GM can use the listed attack stats for whatever weapon they decide the automaton is using. Depending on the automaton's role, it may not have more than one attack type (a chef automaton might attack with a built-in chopping knife but not have any way to make ranged attacks).

The images are representative of the danger and do not accurately depict what will happen. For example, an ambush by hostile bandits might trigger a warning image of amorphous creatures making aggressive motions, and dangerous weather might prompt an image of lightning bolts coming from a cloud. The GM decides when and how the staff warns you of danger (it might be hours or days in advance, depending on circumstances). For inexplicable reasons, sometimes the staff fails to deliver any warning at all (thus, it's all right if the GM forgets occasionally).

When activated as your action, it hovers about a foot off the ground and follows you with a walking speed of 30 feet. It has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 and is always alert for danger, traps, and hidden creatures. If it detects any such threat, it warns you with a series of clicks and blinking lights. Because it can't discern the intent of creatures in the area, it often gives false alarms about creatures that actually mean no harm (particularly in places like cities where there are many creatures moving about).": "这个装置是一个细长的锥形物，大约与一把长剑一样长，顶部有一个类似眼睛的装置。当你将其激活作为你的动作时，它会悬浮在离地面约一英尺的位置，并以30英尺的行走速度跟随你。它拥有被动感知（感知）得分为15，并始终警惕危险、陷阱和隐藏生物。如果它发现任何这样的威胁，它会通过一系列的点击和闪烁的灯光来警告你。由于它无法辨别区域内生物的意图，它经常会对实际上无恶意的生物发出虚假警报（特别是在城市等有许多生物活动的地方）。",

	"When this metallic device with a needle on one end is plunged into your flesh as your action, a burning sensation travels through your body, and you enter a trance- like state for 1 minute as fever grips your body. When your head clears, you recall the echo of unbelievable pain, and find that your face and body have stretched and changed according to a mental image you held in your head, effectively disguising yourself to appear as that being, so long as it is generally same shape and size you were before activation. Your changed visage lasts one day. A suspicious onlooker trying to discern that you are disguised must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Your body returns to its normal visage when the duration expires, putting you through the same process in reverse.": "当你将这个带有一端有针的金属装置插入你的肌肤时，一股灼热感穿过你的身体，你进入一种类似恍惚的状态，持续1分钟，全身被发热包围。当你头脑清醒时，你回忆起难以置信的疼痛回声，并发现你的脸和身体已经拉伸和改变，与你头脑中持有的形象相符，有效地伪装成那个生物，只要它的形状和大小与你激活前大致相同。你改变的面容持续一天。怀疑你伪装的旁观者必须成功通过一次DC 15的智力（调查）检定来辨别你的伪装。当持续时间结束时，你的身体恢复正常面容，将你通过相同的过程反转。",

The images appear around you for 30 minutes, during which time creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight or can see through illusions.": "当你激活这个可以佩戴在手腕上的手环时，作为你的动作，它会投射出你的虚幻影像来迷惑攻击者。这些影像会在你周围出现30分钟，期间生物对你的攻击投掷有劣势。如果攻击者不依赖视觉或能看穿幻象，则对这种效果免疫。",

	"When pressed to a living creature's head and activated, this small metallic disk immediately unleashes microfilaments that enter the brain. Within five minutes, the device reacts to the creature's ability to communicate and make concepts, translating those impulses into audible words in a specific language keyed to the graft. The graft gives the creature a vocabulary of about thirty words, although very simple creatures might be able to use far fewer. Typical words in a creature's vocabulary are: hunger, hunt, food, danger, predator, prey, left, right, up, down, move, stop, fast, slow, cold, hot, pain, fear. If a creature is capable of learning vocal commands or pet tricks, those words are suitable additions to its spoken vocabulary. Approximately half of these grafts have a limited machine intelligence that adds some syntax to the creature's words so it is easier to understand.": "当按压到一个活生物的头部并激活时，这个小金属盘立即释放微纤维进入大脑。在五分钟内，该装置会根据生物的交流和概念能力，将这些冲动转化为特定语言的可听单词，与移植物相匹配。移植物给予生物大约30个词汇，尽管非常简单的生物可能只能使用更少的词汇。生物词汇中的典型词汇包括：饥饿、狩猎、食物、危险、捕食者、猎物、左、右、上、下、移动、停止、快、慢、冷、热、疼痛、恐惧。如果生物能够学习口头命令或宠物技巧，这些词汇适合添加到其口头词汇中。大约一半的这些移植物具有有限的机器智能，为生物的单词添加了一些句法，使其更容易理解。",
	"This fingertip-sized artificial insect is made of metal, biological parts, and a sturdy but flexible reinforcing material. When activated, it responds to your voice commands and travels to a designated area you can see within 500 feet (if you have line of sight to a particular creature, you can instead designate that creature). The drone flies to that area, moving 120 feet each round, and makes a nuisance of itself, attacking creatures randomly (if you designate a creature, it attacks only that creature). It dies after 10 minutes of activity or after it makes one successful attack.": "这只指尖大小的人造昆虫由金属、生物部件和坚固但灵活的加固材料制成。激活后，它会响应您的语音指令，并飞往您在500英尺内能看到的指定区域（如果您能看到特定生物，您也可以指定攻击该生物）。这只无人机飞往该区域，每轮移动120英尺，并会制造麻烦，随机攻击生物（如果您指定了生物，则只攻击该生物）。它在活动10分钟后或进行一次成功攻击后死亡。",
	"When this greenish film is applied across your face and nose as your action, it adheres in place (though you can remove it and put it back on as needed).

As a bonus action, you can aim the burst at a creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet": "当以突发模式激活时，手套会喷射一股高速水柱，最远可达120英尺，一轮内消耗大约100加仑的奇谋容量。作为一个奖励动作，你可以将喷射对准你能看到的120英尺内的生物。目标必须通过一次DC 13的力量豁免才能避免受到1d4的钝击伤害并倒地。你也可以选择一个未被穿戴或携带且重量不超过200磅的物体作为目标。该物体会被击倒或被推移最多15英尺。",
