	"Gunpowder and firearms typically appear in fantasy settings that gravitate toward late-medieval, renaissance, or swashbuckling themes, though they can appear in any setting where alchemists or tinkerers have access to sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter. Presented here are rules for incorporating gunpowder and firearms into your games.": "火药和火器通常出现在偏向晚中世纪、文艺复兴或冒险主题的奇幻设置中，尽管它们也可以出现在任何炼金术士或修补匠可以获得硫磺、木炭和硝石的环境中。这里介绍了将火药和火器融入游戏中的规则。",
	"The first gunpowder weapons included the {@item pistol|ToH}, {@item musket|ToH}, and {@item blunderbuss|ToH}, among others. These early firearms were matchlock, muzzle-loaded weapons. A curved lever held a burning slow match or length of cording. When the trigger was pulled, the lever dropped into the firing chamber, igniting the gunpowder and propelling the ball down the barrel of the firearm.": "最早的火药武器包括{@item pistol|ToH}, {@item musket|ToH}, 和{@item blunderbuss|ToH}, 等等。这些早期的枪支是火绳枪，装弹口，曲柄上握着一根燃烧的慢火绳或一段绳索。当扳机被扣动时，曲柄会落入发射腔，点燃火药并将弹丸推出枪管。",
	"The firearms in this book use the loading and gunpowder properties. You can find the statistics for the firearms and the details for the gunpowder property in the Weapons section of this chapter.": "这本书中的火器使用装填和火药属性。您可以在本章的武器部分找到火器的统计数据和火药属性的详细信息。",
	"Early firearms use a paper \"cartridge,\" a paper cylinder packed with an iron or lead ball, gunpowder, and a primer. To load a firearm, the wielder opens the paper cartridge, pours the gunpowder into the end of the barrel, followed by the ball and the paper. A rod is used to ram the ball and paper down the barrel. Hit or miss, ammunition from a firearm is destroyed once expended.": "早期火器使用纸制“弹药筒”，里面装有铁或铅弹、火药和引信。要装填火器，使用者打开纸筒，将火药倒入枪管的一端，然后放入弹丸和纸筒。使用一根杆子将弹丸和纸筒压入枪管。无论命中与否，火器的弹药在使用后都会被消耗殆尽。",
	"More than almost any other weapon, firearms draw attention when they are used, and they are loud. When a character makes a ranged attack with a firearm, the firearm releases a thunderous boom audible out to the weapon's maximum range. In addition, firearms release a small puff of smoke when fired. Characters hoping to move or fight undetected would be wise to use other weapons. For game masters, be aware of the sight, sound, and smell of firearms and the possibility of such effects alerting other nearby creatures, but also be aware these effects are just as likely to startle or scare away creatures as it is to draw them.": "与几乎任何其他武器相比，当使用枪支时会引起注意，而且声音很大。当角色使用枪支进行远程攻击时，枪支会发出一声巨响，声音可传到武器的最大射程范围。此外，枪支在开火时会释放一小团烟雾。希望悄无声息地移动或战斗的角色最好使用其他武器。对于游戏主持人，要注意枪支的视觉、声音和气味，以及这些效果可能会引起附近其他生物的警觉，但也要意识到这些效果同样可能会吓跑生物，而不仅仅是吸引它们。",
	"A \"firearm\" is any ranged weapon with the gunpowder weapon property. Firearms are designated as simple or martial ranged weapons similar to crossbows and other ranged weapons. A character with simple or martial weapon proficiency also has proficiency with simple or martial firearms, respectively. However, it is up to the GM if gunpowder and firearms are available in the campaign or in a region to which the character has access. If gunpowder and firearms aren't available in the campaign, a character can't use firearms, regardless of the character's weapon proficiencies.": "“火器”是指任何具有火药武器属性的远程武器。火器被指定为简单或军用远程武器，类似于弩和其他远程武器。具有简单或军用武器熟练度的角色也分别具有简单或军用火器的熟练度。然而，是否在战役中或角色可以接触的地区提供火药和火器取决于GM。如果在战役中没有火药和火器，无论角色的武器熟练度如何，角色都不能使用火器。",
	"Throughout history, gunpowder and firearms saw varying levels of distribution and reliability. If your game takes a more historical approach to gunpowder and firearms, here are some optional rules to represent such history.": "在历史上，火药和火器的分布和可靠性各有不同。如果你的游戏更注重火药和火器的历史，这里有一些可选规则来代表这样的历史。",
	"Historically, early gunpowder weapons were very lethal but inaccurate and prone to malfunction. Misfires bring this element of unpredictability into the game. If using this optional rule, all weapons with the gunpowder property have the following additional rule:": "从历史上看，早期火药武器非常致命，但不准确且容易故障。误火将这种不可预测的因素带入游戏中。如果使用这个可选规则，所有具有火药属性的武器都有以下额外规则：",
	"When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll with a weapon with the gunpowder property, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and you can't use the weapon again until you spend an action to repair it. Repairing a firearm requires a successful DC 10 Intelligence check using {@item gunsmith's tools|ToH} or {@item tinker's tools|PHB}. If the check fails, the weapon is jammed and can't be used again until the jam is cleared. Clearing a jammed weapon takes 10 minutes of work using {@item gunsmith's tools|ToH} or {@item tinker's tools|PHB}.": "当你用具有火药属性的武器进行攻击投掷d20时，如果投掷到1，武器就会发生故障。攻击未命中，直到你花费一个动作来修理它之前，你都不能再使用这个武器。修理火器需要进行一次成功的DC 10智力检定，使用{@item gunsmith's tools|ToH}或{@item tinker's tools|PHB}。如果检定失败，武器会卡壳，直到卡壳被清除前都无法再次使用。清除卡壳需要花费10分钟的工作，使用{@item gunsmith's tools|ToH}或{@item tinker's tools|PHB}。",
	"In campaigns where firearms exist but aren't widespread, a character might need a mentor to teach them the proper use, care, and maintenance of firearms. At the GM's discretion, a character can spend downtime training to gain proficiency with simple firearms. With additional training, the character can gain proficiency with martial firearms. Alternatively, training might result in the character becoming proficient with one or more specific firearms.": "在存在但并不普及的火器的战役中，角色可能需要一位导师教导他们正确使用、保养和维护火器。在GM的裁量下，角色可以利用空闲时间进行训练，以获得简单火器的熟练度。通过额外的训练，角色可以获得武器级火器的熟练度。或者，训练可能导致角色熟练掌握一个或多个特定的火器。",
	"In the real world, black powder is ruined once it comes into contact with water. In campaigns where scrolls aren't ruined in the rain or are assumed to be safe in scroll cases or pockets, you can safely assume the same for gunpowder and its paper cartridges. However, if you want to include this limitation in your game, a character with a firearm would need to keep paper cartridges in a waterproof container or risk losing the ammunition each time the character is in the rain or goes for a swim.": "在现实世界中，黑火药一旦接触水就会毁坏。在那些卷轴不会在雨中毁坏或者被认为在卷轴盒或口袋中是安全的战役中，你可以安全地假设火药和其纸弹药也是如此。然而，如果你想在游戏中包含这种限制，一个拥有枪械的角色需要将纸弹药放在防水容器中，否则每次角色置身于雨中或去游泳时都会有失去弹药的风险。",
	"Gunpowder is an often-unpredictable substance. As such, firearms, bombs, and other weapons and items utilizing gunpowder have the potential to deal significant damage. If you roll the highest possible number on an individual damage die (such as a 6 on a d6 or a 12 on a d12) when you attack with this weapon, you can roll that die again and add the result to the total. For example, if your 2d4 roll resulted in a 3 and a 4, you can reroll the 4, adding the result to the current total of 7. When a damage die results in the highest possible number on the die, it is called a \"burst.\"": "火药是一种常常难以预测的物质。因此，使用火药的枪支、炸弹和其他武器和物品具有造成重大伤害的潜力。如果你在使用这种武器进行攻击时掷出了可能的最高数字（比如d6的6或d12的12），你可以重新掷这个骰子，并将结果加到总数上。例如，如果你的2d4掷出了3和4，你可以重新掷4，将结果加到当前的总数7上。当伤害骰掷出了骰子可能的最高数字时，这被称为“爆发”（burst）。",
	"If you roll the highest possible number again, you can roll the damage die again and add the result to the total, further increasing the weapon's damage. Any of the damage dice for this weapon, including extra dice such as from a critical hit or {@classFeature sneak attack|Rogue||1} , can burst and result in a reroll. For each attack you make with this weapon, you can reroll only a number of burst dice equal to your proficiency bonus, regardless of how many damage dice result in the highest possible number.": "如果你再次投掷到最大可能的数字，你可以重新投掷伤害骰，并将结果加到总数上，进一步增加武器的伤害。这个武器的任何伤害骰，包括来自暴击或{@classFeature sneak attack|Rogue||1}等额外骰子，都可以爆裂并导致重新投掷。对于你使用这个武器进行的每次攻击，你只能重新投掷数量等于你熟练加值的爆裂骰，无论有多少伤害骰投掷到最大可能的数字。",
	"For example, a 2nd-level rogue fires a {@item pistol|ToH} and scores a critical hit with {@classFeature sneak attack|Rogue||1}. The character rolls 4d6 damage dice that result in a 1, a 3, a 6 and another 6. The character then rerolls each 6, resulting in a 4 and a 6. The character adds those results to the current damage total for a final damage total of 26. Since the character's proficiency bonus is +2, the character can't reroll the new 6, ending the gunpowder bursts for that attack. When that character makes another attack with the {@item pistol|ToH}, this process starts anew.": "例如，一个2级的盗贼使用{@item pistol|ToH}进行攻击，{@classFeature sneak attack|Rogue||1}获得了一次暴击。角色投掷4个6面骰子，结果为1、3、6和另一个6。然后角色重新投掷每个6，结果为4和6。角色将这些结果加到当前的伤害总数上，最终造成26点伤害。由于角色的熟练加值是+2，角色不能重新投掷新的6，结束了该次攻击的火药爆炸效果。当该角色用{@item pistol|ToH}进行另一次攻击时，这个过程重新开始。",
	"If a single attack with a weapon or item with this property hits multiple targets, the damage is treated as one attack or effect for the purposes of determining how many times the damage can experience a burst, regardless of how many targets take the damage.": "如果一次使用具有此属性的武器或物品的攻击命中多个目标，伤害将被视为一次攻击或效果，用于确定伤害可以经历多少次爆发，而不管有多少目标受到伤害。",
	"Draconic is the language of magic, and draconic rune casting represents ultimate mastery over the manipulation of raw magic. By mastering a metaphysical understanding of draconic runes, a spellcaster can bypass the traditional constraints of magic and channel a rune's power directly into their own spellcasting.": "龙语是魔法的语言，龙文符文代表对原始魔法操控的终极掌握。通过掌握龙文符文的形而上理解，一个施法者可以绕过魔法的传统限制，直接将符文的力量引导到自己的施法中。",
	"As one of the eldest races in most worlds, dragons have a unique understanding of creation and have spent thousands of years mastering the art of its manipulation. Their primal understanding of the forces that shape their worlds allows them to control and bend magic to their will. Their alphabets and symbols hold immense power that, when harnessed, create extraordinary effects. On rare occasions, a mortal spellcaster stumbles upon draconic runes and unlocks a limited understanding of this deep power to cast spells as the most powerful ancient dragons do.": "作为大多数世界中最古老的种族之一，龙对创造有着独特的理解，并花费了数千年来掌握其操控的艺术。他们对塑造世界的力量有着原始的理解，使他们能够控制并弯曲魔法以符合他们的意愿。他们的字母和符号蕴含着巨大的力量，一旦被利用，就会产生非凡的效果。在罕见的情况下，一个凡人咒术师偶然发现了龙符文，并解开了对这种深层力量的有限理解，从而像最强大的古代龙那样施放法术。",
	"Draconic rune casting is a magic system that has two main uses: enhancing spells when using runes as a spellcasting focus or combining empowered runes to replicate spells, both of which are detailed in the following sections. To use a rune, it must first be inscribed on a surface or object. Placement of a draconic rune is limited only by your imagination—it can be inscribed on a spellbook, carved on a small stone, etched into armor, tattooed on the skin, or wherever else suits you.": "龙符铭文是一种魔法系统，主要有两种用途：在使用符文作为施法焦点时增强法术，或者结合强化的符文来复制法术，这两种用途在以下部分详细说明。要使用符文，必须首先将其铭刻在表面或物体上。龙符的放置仅受你的想象力限制——它可以被铭刻在咒语书上，雕刻在小石头上，刻在盔甲上，刺青在皮肤上，或者任何其他适合你的地方。",
	"Once a draconic rune is inscribed, you must empower it with magic each day, which you can do as part of a {@quickref resting|phb|2|0|long rest}, or it becomes inert. An inert rune can't be used to replicate spells, but it otherwise remains unchanged. Many mortal spellcasters stumble upon the secrets of draconic rune casting by finding an inert rune inscribed on an ancient stone pillar or embroidered in a tattered, fading tapestry. As detailed in the {@feat Draconic Rune Casting|ToH} feat, you can have a number of empowered runes at one time equal to 1 + your proficiency.": "一旦刻上龙族符文，你必须每天用魔法赋予它力量，这可以作为{@quickref resting|phb|2|0|long rest}的一部分来完成，否则它会变得无效。一个无效的符文无法用来复制法术，但其他方面保持不变。许多凡人法师偶然发现了龙族符文施法的秘密，发现了刻在古老石柱上或绣在破旧褴褛的挂毯上的无效符文。正如{@feat Draconic Rune Casting|ToH}特性中所详细描述的那样，你可以同时拥有的被赋能的符文数量等于1 + 你的熟练加值。",
	"Utilizing draconic runes requires the {@feat Draconic Rune Casting|ToH} feat (see the Backgrounds and Feats chapter). If the option to gain feats isn't used in your campaign, then the ability to use draconic runes can be gained in place of a level-based ability score improvement, at the GM's discretion. Alternatively, a character might need to accomplish other, story-related tasks determined by the GM to gain the benefits of the {@feat Draconic Rune Casting|ToH} feat.": "利用龙族符文需要{@feat Draconic Rune Casting|ToH}特性（请参阅背景和特性章节）。如果在您的游戏中没有获得特性的选项，那么可以在GM的裁量下，以取代基于等级的属性提升来获得使用龙族符文的能力。另外，角色可能需要完成GM确定的其他与故事相关的任务，以获得{@feat Draconic Rune Casting|ToH}特性的好处。",
	"When used as a spellcasting focus, each draconic rune has a unique feature that modifies the spell being cast. Draconic runes are detailed later in this section, and each description includes the effects that occur whenever you cast a spell using that rune as a spellcasting focus. A master rune can't be used as a spellcasting focus.": "当用作施法焦点时，每个龙符文都有一个独特的特性，可以修改正在施放的法术。龙符文将在本节后面详细介绍，每个描述都包括每当你使用该符文作为施法焦点时发生的效果。主符文不能用作施法焦点。",
	"You must spend at least 1 hour meditating on a draconic rune to magically mark it as your spellcasting focus, which you can do as part of a {@quickref resting|phb|2|0|short or long rest}. You can have only one rune marked as your spellcasting focus at a time. When you mark another rune, the effect on the previous rune ends. A rune doesn't need to be empowered to be marked as your spellcasting focus.": "你必须花至少1小时冥想龙符文，以将其魔法标记为你的施法焦点，你可以在{@quickref resting|phb|2|0|short or long rest}的过程中完成。你一次只能标记一个符文作为你的施法焦点。当你标记另一个符文时，先前符文的效果就会结束。符文不需要被赋予力量就可以被标记为你的施法焦点。",
	"By combining draconic runes you have learned, you can replicate a spell on your class's spell list even if you don't have the spell prepared or on your known spell list. Casting spells in this way still expends spell slots and requires the appropriate components, as normal, even if using runes that represent components. If a component rune is used as a spellcasting focus, it can modify the components required by a spell. See each component rune's description for details.": "通过结合你所学的龙符文，你可以复制你职业法术列表中的一个法术，即使你没有准备这个法术或者它不在你已知的法术列表中。以这种方式施法仍然会消耗法术位，并需要适当的材料组件，就像平常一样，即使使用代表材料组件的符文。如果一个材料组件符文被用作施法焦点，它可以修改法术所需的组件。查看每个材料组件符文的描述以获取详细信息。",
	"Although you are using runes to replicate a spell, you are still casting the spell, which means a spell replicated with draconic rune casting can be affected by spells, such as {@spell counterspell} or {@spell antimagic field}, and other effects that affect spells or spellcasting. When you replicate a spell using draconic rune casting, you must have free use of at least one hand and touch each empowered rune as you cast the spell. If a spell has a somatic component, you can touch the runes as part of that same gesture.": "尽管你使用符文来复制一个咒语，但你仍然在施放这个咒语，这意味着用龙符施法复制的咒语可能会受到咒语，如{@spell counterspell}或{@spell antimagic field}，以及其他影响咒语或施法的效果的影响。当你使用龙符施法来复制一个咒语时，你必须至少有一只手可以自由使用，并在施放咒语时触摸每个被赋予力量的符文。如果一个咒语有手势成分，你可以在同一手势中触摸符文。",
	"To replicate a spell with draconic runes, you must use at least three empowered runes: the master rune of the spell's level, the school rune of the spell's school of magic, and at least one other rune that represents an aspect of the spell, such as its range, a component, or the damage it deals. The total number of empowered runes required to cast a spell increases with the spell's level, as shown in the Rune Requirements table. If you want to cast a spell at a higher level, you must meet the rune requirements of the higher-level version of the spell.": "要用龙符复制一个咒语，你必须至少使用三个强化符文：咒语等级的主符文，咒语所属魔法学派的学派符文，以及至少一个代表咒语某个方面的符文，比如其射程、一个组件或它造成的伤害。施放一个咒语所需的强化符文总数随着咒语等级的增加而增加，如符文需求表中所示。如果你想以更高的等级施放一个咒语，你必须符合该咒语更高级版本的符文要求。",
	"1st–3rd": "第1至第3",
	"4th–6th": "第4至第6(%num%)",
	"7th–9th": "第7至第9(%num%)",
	"To replicate a spell with draconic rune casting, you must match each empowered rune to an aspect of the spell in its standard form. For example, if you use the {@feat Rimecaster|ToH} feat (see the Backgrounds and Feats chapter) to change a {@spell fireball} to deal cold damage, you can't use the {@optfeature frigus|ToH} (cold damage) rune to cast the spell, as the standard form of the {@spell fireball} spell deals fire damage, not cold damage. Similarly, you can't use the {@optfeature umbra|ToH} (illusion school) rune to cast {@spell magic missile}.": "要使用龙符咒法复制一个咒语，你必须将每个强化符文与咒语的一个方面相匹配。例如，如果你使用{@feat Rimecaster|ToH}特性（请参阅背景和特性章节）将一个{@spell fireball}改为造成冰冷伤害，你就不能使用{@optfeature frigus|ToH}（冰冷伤害）符文施放该咒语，因为{@spell fireball}咒语的标准形式造成火焰伤害，而不是冰冷伤害。同样，你也不能使用{@optfeature umbra|ToH}（幻术学派）符文施放{@spell magic missile}。",
	"To replicate a spell with draconic rune casting, you must ordinarily be able to cast the spell with that spell slot. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and five levels in cleric, you can use a 3rd-level master rune to cast any 3rd-level cleric spell (provided you have the other necessary empowered runes), or you can use it to cast a wizard spell of a lower level, such as an enhanced {@spell burning hands}. You can't use a 3rd-level master rune to cast 3rd-level wizard spells (regardless of the other runes you know) until you reach 5th level in the wizard class, when you can normally cast such spells. Draconic rune casting makes your spellcasting more versatile and varied. It doesn't allow you to cast spells ordinarily unavailable to you.": "要使用龙符施法复制一个法术，你通常必须能够用那个法术位来施法。例如，如果你在巫师职业有三级，牧师职业有五级，你可以使用一个3级的主符文来施放任何3级的牧师法术（前提是你有其他必要的强化符文），或者你可以用它来施放一个比较低级的巫师法术，比如一个增强的{@spell burning hands}。你不能使用一个3级的主符文来施放3级的巫师法术（不管你知道的其他符文是什么），直到你在巫师职业达到5级时，你才能正常施放这样的法术。龙符施法使你的施法更加多样化和灵活。它不允许你施放通常对你不可用的法术。",
	"When you use draconic runes to replicate a spell, the empowered runes don't need to be your spellcasting focus. If you use a rune marked as your spellcasting focus as part of replicating a spell, that rune's spellcasting focus feature applies to the replicated spell, as it would to a spell you cast normally. You can use any other spellcasting focus that is part of your spellcasting class when replicating spells from your class list, as normal.": "当你使用龙符文复制一个法术时，强化符文不需要成为你的施法焦点。如果你在复制一个法术时使用了标记为你的施法焦点的符文，那个符文的施法焦点特性将适用于被复制的法术，就像你正常施放法术时一样。当你从你的职业法术列表中复制法术时，你可以像平常一样使用你职业法术类别中的任何其他施法焦点。",
	"Replicating a spell requires at least three empowered runes, but aside from needing to match the spell's level and school, you can use whichever empowered runes you want, provided they match aspects of the spell as described above. For example, you must use the {@optfeature tertious|ToH} (3rd-level) and {@optfeature displodo|ToH} (evocation) runes to replicate a 3rd-level {@spell fireball}, but the third rune can be the {@optfeature gloria|ToH} (range), {@optfeature orotorem|ToH} (verbal component), {@optfeature subita|ToH} (instantaneous duration), {@optfeature concentio|ToH} (somatic component), {@optfeature ignis|ToH} (fire damage), {@optfeature globus|ToH} (sphere), or {@optfeature corporis|ToH} (material component) rune. In this way, creative empowering of the runes you know can enable you to replicate a variety of spells.": "复制一个法术至少需要三个强化符文，但除了需要匹配法术的等级和学派外，你可以使用任何你想要的强化符文，只要它们符合上述描述的法术方面。例如，你必须使用{@optfeature tertious|ToH}（3级）和{@optfeature displodo|ToH}（激发）符文来复制一个3级{@spell fireball}，但第三个符文可以是{@optfeature gloria|ToH}（射程）、{@optfeature orotorem|ToH}（语言成分）、{@optfeature subita|ToH}（瞬间持续时间）、{@optfeature concentio|ToH}（身体成分）、{@optfeature ignis|ToH}（火焰伤害）、{@optfeature globus|ToH}（球体）或{@optfeature corporis|ToH}（物质成分）符文。通过这种方式，你所知道的符文的创造性强化可以让你复制各种法术。",
	"A character can know any number of draconic runes. However, like most ancient magic, draconic runes aren't readily available and must be found, researched, or learned from a mentor. For players, this could provide incentive for your character to seek out long-forgotten libraries, spend downtime researching runes, or even request audiences with dragons themselves. For game masters, you can reward characters with new draconic runes as often as you might reward them with spell scrolls or an enemy's spellbook, or you can use draconic runes as rewards from rescued wizards or draconic allies.": "一个角色可以了解任意数量的龙符文。然而，就像大多数古代魔法一样，龙符文并不readily available，必须被发现、研究，或者从导师那里学习。对于玩家来说，这可能会激励你的角色去寻找被遗忘的图书馆，花费时间研究符文，甚至请求与龙本身会面。对于游戏主持人来说，你可以像奖励角色法术卷轴或敌人的法术书一样经常奖励他们新的龙符文，或者你可以将龙符文作为从被解救的巫师或龙族盟友那里获得的奖励。",
	"As detailed in the {@feat Draconic Rune Casting|ToH} feat (see the Backgrounds and Feats chapter), master runes are learned automatically as a spellcaster increases in level. This can represent the character studying or practicing the most basic principles of draconic runes while studying or practicing their own magic, or it can represent the character's gradual understanding of the correlations between the ancient draconic runes and the more \"modern\" magic the character wields.": "正如{@feat Draconic Rune Casting|ToH}特性（请参阅背景和特性章节）中详细说明的那样，随着施法者等级的提升，符文大师会自动学会符文。这可以代表角色在学习或练习自己的魔法时，同时研究或练习龙符文的基本原理，也可以代表角色逐渐理解古代龙符文与角色所施展的更“现代”魔法之间的关联。",
	"Draconic runes are listed here alphabetically. The Draconic Runes table provides a quick reference for each rune by type. Each rune description includes the following:": "这里按字母顺序列出了龙符文。龙符文表为每个符文按类型提供了快速参考。每个符文描述包括以下内容：",
	"This is the rune's name in Draconic and is presented at the top of its entry.": "这是龙语中符文的名称，并显示在其条目的顶部。",
	"While each draconic rune represents a functional letter in the draconic alphabet, each also represents a concept described in italics below the name of the rune.": "虽然每个龙符代表着龙文字母表中的一个功能字母，但它们也代表着以下斜体描述的概念，位于符文名称下方。",
	"Each rune has a type or category it falls under, such as school or component.": "每个符文都属于一种类型或类别，比如学派或组件。",
	"This is the specific aspect of a spell that this rune represents, such as evocation or verbal.": "这是符文代表的法术特定方面，比如唤醒或语言。",
	"Each rune (except for master runes) has a feature it can grant when you use an item inscribed with the rune as a spellcasting focus.": "每个符文（除了主符文）在你使用刻有该符文的物品作为施法焦点时，都有一个特性可以赋予。",
	"5 feet to 30 feet": "5英尺到30英尺",
	"60 feet to 90 feet": "60英尺到90英尺",
	"120 feet to 500 feet": "120英尺到500英尺",
	"1 mile or farther": "1 英里或更远 (mile)",
	"If you string together the rune names, you can pronounce them to satisfy the verbal component of any spell you replicate. In the middle of combat, when you say \"{@i {@bold {@optfeature octum|ToH} {@optfeature displodo|ToH} {@optfeature gloria|ToH} {@optfeature proelium|ToH} {@optfeature impulsum|ToH}}}\"' to cast the {@spell earthquake} spell, you are really channeling the feeling of spellcasting.": "如果你将符文名称串联在一起，你可以念出它们来满足你复制的任何咒语的口头组成部分。在战斗中，当你说“{@i {@bold {@optfeature octum|ToH} {@optfeature displodo|ToH} {@optfeature gloria|ToH} {@optfeature proelium|ToH} {@optfeature impulsum|ToH}}}”来施放{@spell earthquake}咒语时，你实际上是在传达施法的感觉。",
	"All the \"Draconic\" names for the runes presented here are derived from real-world Latin words. If you are struggling to pronounce them, there are several helpful resources in books or online. And just like a spellcaster would during their adventures, make sure to practice saying these out loud before you use them.": "这里呈现的符文的所有“龙语”名称都源自现实世界的拉丁语单词。如果您发音有困难，可以在书籍或在线资源中找到一些有用的帮助。就像一个法术施放者在冒险中一样，请确保在使用它们之前大声朗读练习。",
	"Draconic rune casting dives into the process of representing any available spell by combining different aspects of spellcasting. With your GM's approval, you can also explore using those components to build original spells.": "龙符文施法深入探讨了通过结合施法的不同方面来代表任何可用法术的过程。在你的(`GM`)同意下，你也可以探索使用这些组件来构建原创法术。",
	"If you learned the runes {@optfeature globus|ToH} (sphere) and {@optfeature cerebrum|ToH} (psychic damage), perhaps you could create a mind-shielding helmet to wear on your head. Or maybe you learn {@optfeature tutela|ToH} (abjuration) and {@optfeature mensis|ToH} (2 days to 30 days) to craft a formula for a defensive wall to last through a siege. The possibilities are truly endless.": "如果你学会了符文{@optfeature globus|ToH}(领域)和{@optfeature cerebrum|ToH}(心灵伤害)，也许你可以制作一个戴在头上的心灵护盔。或者你学会了{@optfeature tutela|ToH}(驱护)和{@optfeature mensis|ToH}(2天到30天)，制作一个持续经受围攻的防御墙的配方。可能性真的是无穷无尽的。",
	"When creating new spells, keep your character's preferences and personal casting styles in mind, and be aware of the kinds of magical assistance your character's allies might need. In this way, draconic rune casting can be a flexible addition to your character's repertoire, potentially fulfilling niche needs of the group. When determining the potency of your new spell, compare it with other spells of similar levels and adjust it accordingly. As always, run any new creations by your GM to confirm they are comfortable with you bringing the spells to the table.": "在创造新法术时，要考虑你角色的喜好和个人施法风格，并且要意识到你角色的盟友可能需要什么样的魔法帮助。通过这种方式，龙符施法可以成为你角色技能库中灵活的补充，潜在地满足团队的特定需求。在确定新法术的效力时，将其与其他类似级别的法术进行比较，并相应调整。如常，务必向你的GM确认他们是否接受你将这些法术带到游戏桌上。",
	"When you use a damage rune as a spellcasting focus to change the damage type of a spell, you can also change the visual representation of the spell. With the {@optfeature tempestas|ToH} rune, the {@spell burning hands} spell could become bolts of lightning fanning out from your fingertips. With the {@optfeature impulsum|ToH} rune, the {@spell fireball} spell could become a boulder that bursts into smaller rocks, pelting your enemies. You can even use these runes to express your character's personal preferences, themes, or styles. Maybe when your roguish spellcasting character uses the {@optfeature scopum|ToH} rune as a spellcasting focus, {@spell burning hands} becomes a fan of daggers. The possibilities are endless!": "当你使用伤害符文作为施法焦点来改变法术的伤害类型时，你也可以改变法术的视觉表现。使用{@optfeature tempestas|ToH}符文，{@spell burning hands}法术可能会变成闪电从你的指尖扇出。使用{@optfeature impulsum|ToH}符文，{@spell fireball}法术可能会变成一个巨石，爆裂成小石块，向你的敌人投掷。你甚至可以使用这些符文来表达你角色的个人喜好、主题或风格。也许当你那个狡诈的施法角色使用{@optfeature scopum|ToH}符文作为施法焦点时，{@spell burning hands}会变成一把匕首扇。可能性是无限的！",
	"Keep in mind, these changes are for visual flair and that changing a {@spell fireball} into a boulder doesn't mean your character now has a pile of rocks to hide behind or throw at enemies. These visual effects last for the duration of the spell, as normal for any visual effects of a spell cast without a damage rune as a spellcasting focus.": "请记住，这些变化是为了视觉效果，将{@spell fireball}变成一个巨石并不意味着你的角色现在有一堆石头可以躲在后面或投向敌人。这些视觉效果持续时间与法术的持续时间相同，就像任何没有伤害符文作为施法焦点的法术的视觉效果一样。",
	"Hedge magic is the practice of using flora with magical properties to create and cast spells. Though it is practiced across many cultures, hedge magic is not a discipline of magic typically recognized as a wizardly tradition or categorized school of magic. While plants in most studies of magic have been used for spell components, potion ingredients, and spell focuses, hedge magic is about nurturing magic plants to reveal their hidden powers. Those who practice hedge magic, commonly called \"hedgecrafters,\" say that magical plants themselves are vessels of arcana and it is up to the individual to unlock these secrets through discipline and applied skill. Any individual has the potential to access a magic plant's minor effect, but only those who understand and practice the traditions of hedge magic can tap into the craft's most potent effects.": "篱笆魔法是利用具有魔力属性的植物来创造和施放咒语的实践。尽管它在许多文化中被实践，但篱笆魔法并不是通常被认为是巫师传统或分类为魔法学派的一种魔法学科。虽然在大多数魔法研究中，植物被用作咒语成分、药剂成分和咒语焦点，但篱笆魔法是关于培育魔法植物以揭示它们隐藏的力量。那些实践篱笆魔法的人，通常被称为“篱笆工匠”，称魔法植物本身是奥秘的容器，而要解锁这些秘密需要个人通过纪律和应用技巧。任何个体都有可能接触到魔法植物的微小效果，但只有那些了解并实践篱笆魔法传统的人才能利用该技艺最强大的效果。",
	"In hedge magic, each plant can produce different magical effects, called worts. Magical plants themselves come in two forms: fresh and dried. Fresh plants can be used in any wort casting while dried plants are only suitable for minor worts. Unless otherwise stated, when a character invokes a wort to cast a spell, the character uses the magic plant in place of the spell's material components. The magic plant is always destroyed in the process of invoking a wort, regardless of the success or failure of the spell. When a wort calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice) or your spell save DC, whichever is higher.": "在树篱魔法中，每种植物都可以产生不同的魔法效果，称为草药。魔法植物本身分为两种形式：新鲜和干燥。新鲜植物可以用于任何草药施法，而干燥植物只适用于较小的草药。除非另有说明，当角色召唤草药施放咒语时，角色使用魔法植物代替咒语的材料成分。无论咒语成功与否，召唤草药时魔法植物都会被摧毁。当一个草药需要进行豁免投骰时，DC等于8 + 你的熟练加值 + 你的智力或感知调整值（你选择）或你的法术豁免 DC，以较高者为准。",
	"The most accessible form of hedge magic, called a minor wort, is a single-use effect similar in scale to a {@filter spell scroll or potion |items|source=|type=potion;scroll}. Using a magic plant in this way takes an action and always requires a somatic component, such as crushing or cutting a plant, snapping a plant in half, consuming flower petals, or similar. Any creature can cast a minor wort, provided the creature is using the appropriate plant in the correct way.": "最易接触的树篱魔法形式，被称为小型草药，是一种类似于{@filter spell scroll or potion |items|source=|type=potion;scroll}规模的一次性效果。以这种方式使用魔法植物需要一个动作，并且总是需要体态成分，比如捏碎或切割植物、折断植物一半、食用花瓣等。任何生物都可以施展小型草药，只要该生物使用正确的植物以正确的方式。",
	"Ceremonial worts are rituals involving the magic plants, and they produce effects similar to spells. It takes time and preparation to invoke a ceremonial wort, and, due to their greater effects, most ceremonial worts have a level requirement, as noted in the plant's entry.": "仪式性草药是涉及魔法植物的仪式，它们产生类似于法术的效果。召唤仪式性草药需要时间和准备工作，由于其更大的效果，大多数仪式性草药都有一个等级要求，如植物条目中所述。",
	"Hedge magic's most potent effects—and the reason practiced hedgecrafters are sought the world over—are called cultivated worts. These worts are both rare to witness and difficult to create. Cultivating plants to access these worts requires downtime, resources, and commitment to continual care, but the results can be monumental. To cultivate a magic plant and have access to this type of wort, see the Gardening downtime activity in the Adventuring Rules chapter.": "（篱笆魔法）最强大的效果——也是为什么受过训练的（篱笆术士）在世界各地都备受追捧的原因——被称为（培育草药）。这些草药很少见，也很难制造。培育植物以获取这些草药需要时间、资源和持续照料的承诺，但结果可能是巨大的。要培育一种魔法植物并获得这种类型的草药，请参阅《冒险规则》章节中的园艺休闲活动。",

To harvest a wild magic plant, a character must make an Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check. The DC is the same for both checks and can be found on the Magic Plant Rarity table. If the harvesting skill check is a failure, the magic plant is destroyed unless the harvesting character has the {@feat Hedgecraft|ToH} feat. Due to their transient nature, there are no magic plants of common rarity.": "要找到并识别一种野生魔法植物，角色必须在魔法植物偏好的生长环境中进行一次智力检定（{@skill Investigation}）（有关这些环境的详细信息，请参阅每种魔法植物的条目）。要收获野生魔法植物，角色必须进行一次智力检定（{@skill Nature}）。这两次检定的难度等级相同，可以在魔法植物稀有度表中找到。如果收获技能检定失败，魔法植物将被摧毁，除非收获角色拥有{@feat Hedgecraft|ToH}特性。由于它们的短暂特性，常见稀有度的魔法植物是不存在的。",

For more details on using magic plants, see the {@variantrule Hedge Magic|ToH|Magic and Spells} chapter.": "花时间培育大量的魔法植物是一个庞大的项目，但会带来非常特别的成果。通过投入大量时间和精力，一个专注的园丁可以发掘出根茎深处隐藏的最强大效果。这不是一项轻松的任务，需要技巧、承诺和耐心。每次只能由一个角色照料一种魔法植物，因为这个过程是密集的，每种魔法植物的需求也不同。有关使用魔法植物的更多细节，请参阅{@variantrule Hedge Magic|ToH|Magic and Spells}章节。",
	"Magic plant gardening is divided into two aspects: cultivating and maintaining. Cultivating involves the downtime necessary to create a new garden filled with a particular type of magic plant, while maintaining involves the downtime necessary to ensure the health and safety of that garden in the long-term.": "魔法植物园艺分为两个方面：培育和维护。培育涉及到创建一个充满特定类型魔法植物的新园地所需的停工时间，而维护则涉及到确保长期保持该园地的健康和安全所需的停工时间。",
	"Cultivating a garden of magic plants requires a character to have the {@feat Hedgecraft|ToH} feat, the appropriate {@item Gardener's Tools|ToH|tools for gardening}, and the ability to perform consecutive workweeks of gardening, with an outlay of 25 gp in expenses per workweek. In addition, the character must have at least ten fresh, mature magic plants of the same type and a suitable plot of land to start cultivating. A fresh, mature magic plant includes its roots and is capable of reproducing. A character can't start a garden with only a magic plant's cuttings. Each type of magic plant has a different cultivation time requirement, as detailed in the cultivated wort section of {@filter each plant's entry|items|source=toh|type=magic plant|category=} in the Magic and Spells chapter. Once a magic plant garden has been cultivated, it produces fresh cuttings each day, and creatures in the garden gain access to its cultivated magical effects, as long as the garden remains maintained.": "培育魔法植物花园需要角色拥有{@feat Hedgecraft|ToH}特性，适当的{@item Gardener's Tools|ToH|tools for gardening}，并且能够连续工作数周进行园艺工作，每周支出25 gp。此外，角色必须至少拥有十株同一种类的新鲜成熟魔法植物和一块适合的土地来开始培育。新鲜成熟的魔法植物包括其根部并且能够繁殖。角色不能仅凭魔法植物的插条开始一个花园。每种魔法植物都有不同的培育时间要求，详细信息请参阅{@filter each plant's entry|items|source=toh|type=magic plant|category=}中的培育草药部分，位于《魔法与法术》章节中。一旦培育出魔法植物花园，它每天都会产生新鲜的插条，花园中的生物可以获得其培育的魔法效果，只要花园保持良好状态。",
	"If the character has an assistant to tend the garden while the character is away, the cultivating weeks don't need to be consecutive. The character must still spend the requisite number of workweeks cultivating the garden and spend the required funds before the garden's cultivated magical effects can be used. The assistant doesn't need the Hedgecraft feat to tend the garden. For example, a character begins cultivating a garden of chaunic clover, spending two workweeks doing so. The character's assistant then tends the garden for three weeks while the character spends time adventuring. After the adventure, the character must spend two more workweeks cultivating the garden to fulfill the clover's requirement of four weeks of cultivation before gaining access to its cultivated wort.": "如果角色有一个助手在角色离开时照料花园，那么培育的周数不需要连续。角色仍然必须花费所需数量的工作周来培育花园，并在花园的培育魔法效果可以使用之前花费必要的资金。助手不需要拥有Hedgecraft（树篱术）特技来照料花园。例如，一个角色开始培育一片chaunic clover花园，花费了两个工作周。然后，角色的助手在角色冒险时照料花园三周。冒险结束后，角色必须再花费两个工作周来培育花园，以满足clover花所需的四周培育要求，然后才能获得其培育的草药。",
	"To cultivate a garden of magic plants, a character makes a series of checks, with a DC determined by the rarity of the magic plant, as shown on the Magic Plant Cultivation table. Cultivation complications can increase the DC.": "为了培育一片魔法植物园，一个角色需要进行一系列检定，检定的难度等级由魔法植物的稀有度决定，如魔法植物培育表所示。培育过程中的意外事件可能会增加难度等级。",
	"For each workweek spent cultivating after the first week, the character makes one check of the player's choice: Strength ({@skill Athletics}), Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}), Intelligence ({@skill Nature}), or Wisdom ({@skill Survival}). If desired, the character can replace up to half of the necessary skill checks with Constitution saving throws, getting the job done through perseverance and hard work. The character has advantage on a check if another character assists with the gardening that week. The assistant doesn't need the Hedgecraft feat to aid the gardening character.": "对于第一周之后花在栽培上的每个工作周，角色可以选择进行一次检定：力量({@skill Athletics})、智力({@skill Arcana})、智力({@skill Nature}) 或者感知({@skill Survival})。如果需要，角色可以用体质豁免来替代最多一半的技能检定，通过毅力和努力完成工作。如果另一个角色在那周帮忙园艺，角色在检定时获得优势。帮手不需要拥有Hedgecraft特性来帮助园艺角色。",
	"A failure means the character made no real progress that week, and that workweek doesn't count toward fulfilling the requisite number of cultivating weeks for that magic plant (funds are still spent normally for the week). If the character fails three checks, there is a 50 percent chance the magic plants are ruined, and the character must acquire more before attempting to cultivate a garden again.": "失败意味着角色在那周没有取得任何实质性进展，那个工作周不计入满足培育魔法植物所需的周数（资金仍然按正常方式花费）。如果角色失败三次检定，魔法植物有50%的几率被毁坏，角色必须在再次尝试培育花园之前获取更多（funds）(资金)。",
	"A success means the character made progress that week, and that workweek counts toward fulfilling the requisite number of cultivating weeks for that magic plant. If the character succeeds on three checks, the magic plants are healthy enough that they can't be ruined, regardless of how many failures the character has afterward. If the character successfully cultivates the garden, the cultivated wort immediately becomes available at the end of the final requisite workweek, and the garden provides the benefits described in the plant's cultivated wort entry. The cultivated wort lasts for as long as the garden is maintained. If the character isn't of a high enough level to activate the magic plant's cultivated wort, the garden remains healthy as long as it is maintained, and the cultivated wort can be activated with one week of work any time after the character reaches the appropriate level.": "成功意味着角色在那周取得了进展，并且那个工作周计入了种植那种魔法植物所需的培育周数。如果角色在三次检定中成功，那么魔法植物将变得足够健康，无论之后角色失败多少次，它们都不会被毁坏。如果角色成功培育了花园，培育的草药将立即在最后一个必要的工作周结束时变得可用，并且花园提供了植物培育草药条目中描述的好处。培育的草药会持续到花园被维护的时间结束。如果角色的等级不够高以激活魔法植物的培育草药，那么只要花园得到维护，它就会保持健康，并且在角色达到适当等级后的任何时间内，只需一周的工作即可激活培育的草药。",
	"Once cultivated, a garden of magic plants requires 25 gp and at least one workweek of maintenance every 30 days to retain its magical properties. Maintaining the garden doesn't require a skill check, and a character doesn't need the Hedgecraft feat to do so. Alternatively, a character with the Hedgecraft feat can spend 25 gp and one day tending the garden every 30 days to maintain it. If a garden hasn't been maintained in over 30 days, it loses its cultivated wort, and the garden must be cultivated anew. At the GM's discretion, up to {@dice 1d10} of the plants in the abandoned garden can be recovered and used to cultivate a new garden": "一旦培育，魔法植物园需要25 gp 和至少一个工作周的维护，每30天保持其魔法属性。维护花园不需要技能检定，角色也不需要拥有（Hedgecraft）特性来进行维护。另外，拥有（Hedgecraft）特性的角色可以每30天花费25 gp 和一天的时间来照料花园以维持它。如果花园超过30天没有被维护，它将失去培育的草药，花园必须重新培育。在GM的裁量下，被遗弃花园中的最多{@dice 1d10}的植物可以被回收并用于培育新花园。",
	"A cultivated garden produces {@dice 2d6} fresh plant cuttings each week it is maintained after the initial cultivation. A fresh cutting remains usable and magical for up to 10 days. A cutting must be dried to maintain any magic after 10 days. A \"cutting\" varies by magic plant, but it is typically a sprig or bloom.": "一个经过栽培的花园在初始栽培后每周会产生{@dice 2d6}株新鲜植物插条。新鲜插条在保持可用和魔力状态的时间为10天。超过10天后，插条必须晾干以保持任何魔力。\"插条\"根据魔法植物的不同而异，但通常是一小枝或一朵花。",
	"Cultivating large quantities of magic plants can sometimes attract unwanted and even dangerous attention, and growing anything comes with the risks of exposure to the elements or natural disasters. A character has a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each workweek spent cultivating a magic garden. When a complication is triggered, the GM can create a complication or roll a {@dice d6} and consult the Cultivating Complications table. Maintaining a magic garden doesn't trigger a complication, but, at the GM's discretion, inclement weather, thieves, or other events might reduce the number of clippings the garden produces each week.": "培育大量魔法植物有时会引起不必要甚至危险的注意，而种植任何植物都伴随着暴露于自然元素或自然灾害的风险。每个角色在耕种魔法花园时，有10%的几率触发一个并发症。当触发并发症时，GM可以创造一个并发症或投掷一个{@dice d6}并查阅《培育并发症》表。维护魔法花园不会触发并发症，但在GM的决定下，恶劣天气、小偷或其他事件可能会减少花园每周产生的插枝数量。",

	"For the characters to build an initial hub where they can begin their foray into the trade business, they must visit the locale, succeed on a DC 10 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to convince the locals of the benefits of the new business, and provide 5,000 gp to construct the physical building and hire employees to operate it. At that point, the characters have an established trading company, but it operates only locally, buying goods wholesale from other traders to sell. If the characters want to expand their enterprise, they must establish trade zones.": "为了让角色们建立一个最初的中心，他们可以开始他们的贸易生意，他们必须前往当地，成功进行一次 DC 10 魅力检定({@skill Persuasion})，说服当地人相信新生意的好处，并提供 5,000 gp 用于建造实体建筑和雇佣员工来运营。在那时，角色们就有了一个成立的贸易公司，但它只在本地运营，从其他交易商那里批发购买商品进行销售。如果角色们想要扩大他们的企业，他们必须建立贸易区。",

In this example, a value of 90 percent means the characters would need to pay 10 gp out of their pockets to make another trade run that costs 100 gp, while a value of 110 percent means the characters could add 10 gp to their group treasury and could spend the other 100 gp on another trade run that costs 100 gp. A total loss means the characters would have to pay the full 100 gp to send goods on that trade run again.": "例如，如果一次贸易运输对角色们花费了100 gp，价值90%意味着生意在运输结束时赚了90 gp，而110%的价值意味着生意最终赚了110 gp，TL的价值意味着生意最终没有赚到钱。在这个例子中，价值90%意味着角色们需要额外支付10 gp来进行另一次花费100 gp的贸易运输，而110%的价值意味着角色们可以将10 gp添加到他们的团队金库中，并可以将其他100 gp用于另一次花费100 gp的贸易运输。总损失意味着角色们需要支付全部100 gp 来再次发送货物进行那次贸易运输。",
	"As the trading company grows, it faces risks associated with transporting goods over greater distances and through more hostile terrain, fees and exchange rates in foreign lands, complications related to changing laws or political atmospheres as the goods cross borders, and so forth. The profit tables are divided by zone to reflect these varying challenges.": "随着贸易公司的发展，它面临着与将货物运送到更远距离和更恶劣地形、外国地区的费用和汇率、货物跨越边境时涉及的法律或政治氛围变化等风险。利润表按区域划分，以反映这些不同的挑战。",
	"Unlike most downtime activities, which often include complications — either adverse or beneficial — as part of the results, this downtime provides such developments abstractly through profits and losses, represented by the profit percentages on the profit tables. When a shipment of goods pays out only a fraction of the initial coin spent, or when the trading company experiences a huge windfall, the details of such results are left to the GM and players to determine. Perhaps bandits struck a caravan and made off with part of the shipment, or maybe demand for commodities has risen during a wartime economy. Such events can become part of the ongoing dynamics of the campaign and can be the seeds of a new adventure for the characters.": "与大多数休闲活动不同，通常包括各种复杂情况——无论是不利的还是有利的——作为结果的一部分，这种休闲通过利润表上的利润百分比抽象地提供这些发展。当一批货物的运输只支付了最初花费的一小部分硬币，或者贸易公司获得了巨额收益时，这些结果的细节留给GM和玩家来决定。也许强盗袭击了一列商队并带走了部分货物，或者也许商品需求在战时经济中上升。这些事件可以成为战役持续动态的一部分，并且可以成为角色新冒险的种子。",
	"Multiply the Total Expense by the Profit Percentage and enter the result in this column. This is the amount of coin earned from selling that trade good in this trade run. Add together all of the results in this column to get the total earnings from this trade run. By also adding together the expenses in the Expense column, the characters can compare their total expenses and total return to discover how lucrative (or not) this trade run was for them, giving them insight into what changes they might want to make for the next trade run, such as more or less participation, changing the goods they trade, or even expanding their trade zone.": "将总费用乘以利润百分比，然后将结果输入到这一列中。这是从出售该商品在这次贸易中赚取的硬币数量。将这一列中的所有结果相加，以获得这次贸易中的总收入。通过将费用列中的费用相加，角色们可以比较他们的总费用和总回报，以发现这次贸易对他们来说是多么有利（或者不利），从而让他们了解他们可能想要为下一次贸易做出哪些改变，比如增加或减少参与度、更改交易商品，甚至扩大他们的贸易区域。",
	"The characters decide to start up a trading company using 12,000 gp of accumulated wealth, intending to start off conservatively, with lower-risk commodities. They sink 5,000 gp into establishing a trade company headquarters in the local town (population 1,500) where they spend most of their time between adventures. They then spend another 2,500 gp to establish a hub in order to create a provincial trade zone. Though setting up the headquarters in a larger city would allow for greater future business growth, they decide to place the headquarters closest to where they are adventuring, allowing them to spend downtime participating in the business. This means they can conduct trade only within the province for now.": "这些角色决定利用积累的12,000 gp 成立一家贸易公司，打算从保守的角度开始，选择低风险的商品。他们投入5,000 gp 在当地小镇（人口1,500）建立贸易公司总部，这里是他们在冒险之间大部分时间的地方。然后再花费2,500 gp 建立一个中心，以创建一个省级贸易区。尽管在一个更大的城市建立总部将为未来的业务增长提供更大的空间，但他们决定将总部设在离他们冒险地点最近的地方，这样可以利用业余时间参与业务。这意味着他们目前只能在省内进行贸易。",
	"With the hubs established, they begin the process of convincing the authorities and merchants of the value of their trade plans. The group's bard, with the aid of the paladin using the Help action, rolls a Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check with advantage, resulting in a 19—exceeding the DC 15 required to succeed for provincial trade. (If the check had failed, the group could try again after a month, gaining a +5 bonus to the check. If that roll failed, the next check would be made another month later with a +10 bonus, and so on, until they finally manage to work through all the bureaucracy and glad-handing necessary to establish the zone.)": "在建立了枢纽之后，他们开始说服当局和商人们他们贸易计划的价值。小组的吟游诗人，在圣骑士的帮助下使用帮助动作，进行了一次以优势进行的魅力检定（{@skill Persuasion}），最终得到了19——超过了所需的DC 15，成功地为省际贸易铺平了道路。（如果检定失败，小组可以在一个月后再次尝试，获得+5的检定奖励。如果那次检定失败，下一次检定将在一个月后进行，获得+10的奖励，依此类推，直到他们最终设法通过所有必要的官僚手续和应酬来建立该区域。）",
	"Now that the zone is established, the group needs transportation and goods. They invest in two caravans, spending 800 gp and gaining a load capacity of 10 units. This leaves the fledging business with 3,700 gp to buy trade goods. They purchase 4 units of durable goods (600 gp), 4 units of textiles (800 gp), and 2 units of spices (2,000 gp) for a total cost of 3,400 gp, leaving them with 300 gp in the group treasury for the future.": "现在区域已经建立，小组需要交通工具和货物。他们投资购买了两列商队，花费了800 gp，获得了10个单位的装载能力。这让这家新兴企业还剩下3,700 gp 用于购买贸易商品。他们购买了4个单位的耐用品 (600 gp)，4个单位的纺织品 (800 gp)，和2个单位的香料 (2,000 gp)，总共花费了3,400 gp，剩下300 gp 存放在小组的财政中以备将来之需。",
	"The caravans are ready to go, and the group figuratively waves goodbye to them as they depart. Over the next month, the group strikes out on other excursions, but each time the members return to the town from their adventuring, they take a day or two to check on the business, making sure operations are running smoothly and that any unexpected challenges or set-backs are handled. Over the 30 days of the provincial trade run, they devote 6 days toward managing the trading company, enough to gain the +3 Participation Modifier.": "商队已经准备好出发了，当它们启程时，团队象征性地向它们挥手告别。在接下来的一个月里，团队进行了其他的探险，但每次成员们从冒险中返回镇上时，他们都会花一两天的时间检查生意，确保运营顺利进行，并处理任何意外挑战或挫折。在省际贸易运营的30天里，他们花了6天时间管理贸易公司，足以获得+3参与度修正值。",
	"At the end of the month, it's time to see what kind of success they garnered from the trading. Because the trade route is at the provincial level, the players use that table to determine what kind of profits or losses they incur for the month. The Provincial Profit table indicates the die roll is {@dice 2d4} + the modifier, which in this case is +3 due to their participation. Each kind of trade good gets its own roll. For the durable goods, the final result is 9 (3 and 3 on the {@dice d4}s plus 3 for the modifier) and, reading across the row marked \"9\" to the column where Durable Goods results are listed, the income shown is 126 percent. They record this value on their Trade Sheet. For textiles, the players roll another 9, resulting in 119 percent return, and the result for spices is only 6 with a 109 percent return.": "在月底，是时候看看他们从贸易中获得了什么样的成功。由于贸易路线在省级范围内，玩家们使用该表格来确定他们在该月份中获得的利润或损失。省级利润表显示骰子点数为{@dice 2d4} + 修正值，本例中修正值为+3，因为他们参与其中。每种商品都有自己的点数。对于耐用品，最终结果是9（{@dice d4}的3和3加上修正值的3），在标有“9”的行上查找到耐用品结果所列的列，显示的收入为126%。他们在贸易表上记录这个值。对于纺织品，玩家再次投掷骰子得到9，获得119%的回报，而香料的结果只有6，回报率为109%。",
	"Now that they have recorded their investment returns, they multiply the total expenses for each trade good by its profit percentage (for the durable goods, that's 600 gp times 126 percent, which equals 756 gp), then record each result in the Return column, as shown in the Trade Sheet Example. Adding the values in the Return column together shows a total of 3,888 gp. Adding the values in the Expense column together shows their expense of 3,400 gp. This means the characters spent 3,400 gp on the trade goods and received 488 gp of net profit for the month, which is not a bad start to their trading enterprise.": "现在他们已经记录了他们的投资回报，他们将每种商品的总费用乘以其利润百分比（对于耐用品，即600 gp乘以126%，等于756 gp），然后将每个结果记录在回报列中，如交易表示例所示。将回报列中的值相加，总计为3,888 gp。将费用列中的值相加，显示他们的费用为3,400 gp。这意味着角色们在交易商品上花费了3,400 gp，并在当月获得了488 gp的净利润，这对于他们的交易企业来说是一个不错的开端。",
	"The group could now choose to keep doing this same trade run with the same sets of goods by spending 3,400 gp of the money they just earned, or they could expand things by investing in more wagons or perhaps some barges and increasing their load capacity. Depending on their other sources of income and where their adventures take them in the coming months, they might choose to move their headquarters to a bigger city (by spending 2,500 gp) and expand their trading company to handle larger trade zones, increasing their chances at greater profits — or losses.": "该团队现在可以选择花费3,400 gp中的一部分来继续进行相同的贸易运输，使用相同的货物组合，或者他们可以通过投资更多马车或者一些驳船来扩展业务，增加装载能力。根据他们的其他收入来源以及未来几个月冒险的地点，他们可能会选择将总部迁至更大的城市（花费2,500 gp），并扩大他们的贸易公司以处理更大的贸易区域，增加获利或损失的机会。",

	"One seldom-utilized element of long-term campaign play is the characters' acquisition of land and titles. Roleplaying a group of adventurers engaged in exciting and dangerous expeditions into the wilderness, against maniacal cults and secret societies, or among the cunning and shady machinations of the political class can and should be the focus of any game. But with success comes power—in the form of greater prowess (leveling up), wealth, contacts, and sometimes property": "长期战役中很少被利用的元素是角色获得土地和头衔。扮演一群冒险者，参与激动人心和危险的远征，对抗狂热的异教团体和秘密社团，或者在政治阶层狡猾和阴暗的阴谋中，这应该是任何游戏的重点。但成功带来的是权力——以更强大的能力（升级）、财富、人脉，有时还有财产。",
	"Such property can exist in many forms, including as a village workshop, a ship, a guild hall, a palace, or even as an underground cavern kingdom, but the traditional medieval fantasy campaign setting practically begs to see the heroes gain title to a rural manor or castle. Of course, not every campaign takes place in a medieval fantasy world. This downtime activity uses the term \"manor,\" but the idea of the \"manor\" should be stretched to include other kinds of resource-producing properties set in different regions and climates. A vast swath of open, temperate plains featuring a ranch filled with livestock, a vineyard set among the hills, terraced mountains covered in coffee, or a tropical island teeming with fish, mussels, and rare bird eggs could each easily serve as titled property for characters of status and wealth. Ultimately, it doesn't really matter what form the manor takes, as long as you and your players have fun putting it together and running it as a lucrative downtime activity.": "这样的财产可以以许多形式存在，包括作为一个村庄车间，一艘船，一个行会大厅，一座宫殿，甚至是一个地下洞穴王国，但传统的中世纪幻想战役背景几乎要求英雄们获得对农村庄园或城堡的所有权。当然，并非每场战役都发生在中世纪幻想世界中。这个闲暇活动使用了术语“庄园”，但“庄园”的概念应该被延伸到包括在不同地区和气候中设定的其他种类的资源生产性财产。一个广阔的开阔、温和的平原，有着充满牲畜的牧场，坐落在山丘之间的葡萄园，梯田覆盖着咖啡的山脉，或者一个充满鱼、贻贝和稀有鸟蛋的热带岛屿，每一个都可以轻松地作为地位和财富的角色的封号财产。最终，庄园采取何种形式并不重要，只要您和您的玩家们在组建和经营它作为有利可图的闲暇活动时玩得开心即可。",
	"When rewarding your player's characters with a manor, you must first determine the size and nature of the property. Then you must determine what kind of input and output is possible to maintain and reap from the property. This downtime presents a range of options for various facets of a manor. Though the tables presented here can help you and your players generate a reasonable set of criteria for a manor (or for you to quickly create an NPC's estate), characters owning property is more fulfilling when you and your players spend time considering and selecting appropriate outcomes that suit both the particulars of the campaign and the players' goals for their characters.": "当奖励玩家角色一个庄园时，你必须首先确定财产的大小和性质。然后你必须确定可以维护和从财产中获得什么样的投入和产出。这段空闲时间提供了各种庄园各个方面的选择。虽然这里提供的表格可以帮助你和你的玩家生成一个合理的庄园标准（或者让你快速创建一个NPC的庄园），但当你和你的玩家花时间考虑和选择适合于战役的具体情况和玩家对角色目标的适当结果时，拥有财产的角色会更加充实。",

The scores work similarly to a character's ability scores, quantifying the manor's innate characteristics in a range of 3 to 18.

For example, characters who want more cropland might spend a season cutting down some trees, reducing the acres of forest and increasing the acres of cropland by the same amount. No resource's acreage can be reduced below 5 percent of its original, starting acreage without losing all benefits of that resource type (in other words, if the characters cut down all the trees of the forest, they eliminate the ability to harvest any timber, furs, or similar).

	"A manor operates as a self-sustaining entity, producing goods and services contributing to the health and well-being of the occupants, maintenance of the structures, and so forth. Thus, good cropland on a manor produces vegetables and grains that feed the lord, family, and tenants, while stone from a quarry contributes to the building of new structures, and furs from creatures trapped in the woodland are made into clothing or sold for coin to further aid in supply and upkeep. In this way, a subsistence cycle continues season after season, with banner seasons producing bumper crops and poor seasons forcing the lord to dig into the financial coffers to cover shortfalls.": "一个(领地)在自给自足的基础上运作，生产商品和提供服务，有助于居民的健康和幸福，维护建筑结构等。因此，领地上的良好耕地生产蔬菜和谷物，供养领主、家人和佃农，而采石场的石材有助于建造新的建筑物，从林地捕获的动物皮毛则制成衣物或出售换取金币，进一步帮助供给和维护。这样，一个自给自足的循环在季节之间持续进行，丰收的季节产出丰收，贫瘠的季节迫使领主动用财政储备来弥补不足。",
	"To emulate this cycle, take these five steps to determine what kind of production occurs, as follows:": "为了模拟这个循环，请按照以下五个步骤来确定发生了什么类型的生产，如下所示：",
	"Determine the season (Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall). The yield for a season is determined at the end of that season.": "确定季节（冬季，春季，夏季或秋季）。在季节结束时确定该季节的产量。",
	"Determine Character Participation by calculating how much time the characters spent at the manor during that season. Note any efficiency bonuses and expertise benefits the manor gained from the characters.": "通过计算角色在庄园度过的时间来确定角色参与度。记录角色为庄园带来的效率奖励和专业技能加成。",
	"Determine any Complications that happen that season and their effects.": "确定本赛季发生的任何并发症及其影响。",
	"Make Production checks (see the Manor Production section) to determine the Yield Percentage of each resource, applying all pertinent modifiers and cross-referencing the result on the season's Yield table.": "进行生产检查（参见庄园生产部分），以确定每种资源的产量百分比，应用所有相关修正并在当季的产量表上交叉参考结果。",
	"Calculate the total profit for each resource that season using the Yield Percentage, as described in the Manor Production section.": "根据庄园生产部分描述的产量百分比，计算每种资源在该季度的总利润。",
	"Determine whether the characters have spent enough time at the manor to help in its production efficiency. If no characters spent time at the manor during a season, the manor makes Production checks without the efficiency bonus.": "确定角色是否在庄园花足够的时间来提高生产效率。如果没有角色在一个季节内在庄园花时间，庄园在进行生产检查时不会获得效率奖励。",
	"If a full cycle of seasons (typically 1 year) passes without any character participating in the production of the manor, the manor no longer makes Production checks and remains self-sufficient enough to sustain itself for another full cycle of seasons. If a second full cycle of seasons passes without any character participating in the production of the manor, it begins to deteriorate, losing staff, crops, livestock, and other resources. Deteriorating manors make Production checks each season with a penalty to each roll equal to the manor's efficiency bonus. If a deteriorating manor's yield percentage for three of six resources is at or below 75 percent for two consecutive seasons, the manor is abandoned and no longer productive. At your discretion, the characters might lose rights to the manor if it is left to deteriorate.": "如果一个完整的季节周期（通常为1年）过去了，没有任何角色参与庄园的生产，那么庄园不再进行生产检查，并保持足够自给自足，可以维持自身在另一个完整的季节周期中生存。如果再过去一个完整的季节周期，没有任何角色参与庄园的生产，庄园开始恶化，失去员工、庄稼、牲畜和其他资源。恶化的庄园每个季节进行生产检查，每次检查的惩罚值等于庄园的效率奖励。如果一个恶化的庄园在连续两个季节中有三种资源中的百分比产量低于或等于75%，那么该庄园将被遗弃，不再具备生产能力。酌情而定，如果庄园被任由恶化，角色可能会失去对庄园的权利。",
	"If at least one of the characters spent at least 10 percent of the season's days on the premises, it is assumed the character was overseeing the operations to a limited but significant degree, helping the manor run smoothly. In this case, each of the six Production checks gains the benefits of the manor's efficiency bonus. The time a character spends on-site doesn't need to be consecutive days, but it can't include non-managerial activities, like scribing scrolls, crafting, or recuperating.": "如果至少有一个角色在本季度的日子里至少花费了10%的时间在庄园内，就可以假设该角色在一定程度上监督了运营工作，帮助庄园顺利运转。在这种情况下，每个六次生产检查都将获得庄园效率奖励的好处。角色在现场花费的时间不需要连续的日子，但不能包括非管理性的活动，比如抄写卷轴、制作物品或休息。",
	"If at least one of the characters spent at least 25 percent of the season's days on the premises, then that character has thoroughly overseen operations. In this case, each of the six Production checks gains the benefits of both the efficiency bonus and the character's expertise benefits, as shown on the Character Expertise Benefits table. Again, the days don't need to be consecutive, but they can't include other, non-participating activities. Only characters who each spent at least 25 percent of the season's days on the premises can contribute expertise benefits to the manor.": "如果至少有一个角色在整个季节的日子中至少花费了25%的时间在庄园内，那么该角色已经彻底监督了运营。在这种情况下，六次生产检查中的每一次都将获得效率奖励和角色专业技能奖励的双重好处，如角色专业技能奖励表所示。再次强调，这些日子不需要连续，但不能包括其他非参与活动。只有每个至少在庄园内度过了整个季节25%的日子的角色才能为庄园提供专业技能奖励。",
	"A resource listed as an expertise benefit indicates an area where a character class's particular skills come in handy for improving the production of that resource. For example, a druid is quite useful for tending crops and livestock, a bard of some renown increases contentment in the local inn, and a wizard can use magic to aid any number of efforts.": "一个被列为专长福利的资源表示这是一个角色职业特定技能能够帮助提高该资源生产的领域。例如，一个德鲁伊对于照料庄稼和牲畜非常有用，一位有名望的吟游诗人可以增加当地客栈的满意度，而一个法师可以利用魔法来帮助各种努力。",
	"If a character's expertise benefit includes a resource, that resource has advantage on the Production check at the end of the season. As versatile spellcasters, wizards are unique and can choose which resource gains an expertise benefit that season.": "如果角色的专长福利包括一种资源，那么该资源在赛季结束时进行生产检查时会获得优势。作为多才多艺的施法者，(wizards)是独特的，可以选择在该赛季哪种资源获得专长福利。",
	"Any character that had complete participation in the manor that season contributes expertise benefits. If multiple characters contribute Defense and Contentment benefits, add the bonuses together for the total character participation bonuses to Defense and Contentment.

Keep in mind, these story elements can arise even if they aren't directly related to the force haunting the characters. For example, characters haunted by ghosts might be eager to help grave keepers or priests who ensure the peaceful rest of the dead, knowing well what can happen when the dead don't find eternal rest.": "通常涉及闹鬼团体的故事会包含与控制（内部和外部）或信仰相关的元素，这取决于每个角色与困扰他们的事物的关系。角色的困扰应该在每个任务或故事情节的背景中挥之不去，不断提醒他们无法摆脱的力量。请记住，即使这些故事元素与困扰角色的力量无直接关联，它们也可能出现。例如，被鬼魂困扰的角色可能会急于帮助保墓人或确保死者得到安宁安息的神职人员，深知当死者无法得到永恒安息时会发生什么。",

	"The terror inherent in the supernatural is especially powerful when its forces don't play by measurable or understandable rules. This never-ending terror leads to struggles that never really end. They can simply be managed or minimized. Haunted characters must constantly wrestle with controlling external forces and themselves to achieve some degree of normalcy.": "超自然现象中固有的恐怖在其力量不受可测量或可理解规则约束时尤为强大。这种永无止境的恐怖导致了永远无法真正结束的挣扎。它们只能被简单地管理或减少。被鬼魂缠绕的角色必须不断努力控制外部力量和自己，以实现某种程度的正常。",
	"When building a game around a haunted party, themes of faith can be a huge cornerstone. In almost every supernatural narrative, faith exists as the only weapon truly capable of defeating the darkness. Since the supernatural is wholly unknowable, finding an equally unknowable force, such as faith, to challenge it is compelling.": "在围绕着一个闹鬼派对的游戏中，信仰主题可以是一个重要的基石。在几乎每个超自然叙事中，信仰都存在，作为唯一真正能够击败黑暗的武器。由于超自然是完全无法知晓的，找到一个同样无法知晓的力量，比如信仰，来挑战它是引人入胜的。",
	"The characters catch word of another person suffering the same supernatural affliction as someone in their group. If the person is dealing with this alone, the characters might need to help.": "角色们听说另一个人遭受了与他们小组中某人相同的超自然困扰。如果这个人独自应对困境，角色们可能需要帮助。",

	"Stories involving homeward bound groups typically include elements related to camaraderie or perseverance as the group fights to return home. Unless you and your players decide otherwise, the characters were stranded in an unknown location relatively recently. The entire campaign doesn't have to be focused on the characters making their way home (after all, the story of what happens after long-absent characters return home can also be compelling), but at least the beginning of the story should feature this shared goal.": "涉及归途团队的故事通常包括与同伴情谊或坚韧不拔相关的元素，因为团队努力回家。除非你和你的玩家另有决定，角色们最近被困在一个未知地点。整个冒险故事不一定要专注于角色们回家的过程（毕竟，长时间离家后角色们回家后发生的故事也可能很引人入胜），但至少故事的开头应该包含这个共同的目标。",
	"Here are suggested story elements and quest hooks to inspire adventures centered around homeward bound characters. For quest hooks, you can choose a hook or roll a {@dice d6} and consult the table.": "这里有一些建议的故事元素和任务钩子，可以激发围绕归途角色展开的冒险。对于任务钩子，你可以选择一个钩子，或者投掷一个{@dice d6}并查阅表格。",
	"There are few things more terrifying than being stranded in a completely unfamiliar place, but being stranded alone is one of them. Stories exploring the relationship of a group of people flung into an unknown land emphasize the importance of teamwork, trust, and reliance on one another.": "在一个完全陌生的地方被困的事情很少有比独自被困更可怕的了。探讨一群人被投入一个未知土地的关系的故事强调了团队合作、信任和相互依赖的重要性。",
	"From time to time, long journeys might seem impossible and shake the faith of even the most stalwart of travelers. Campaigns featuring Homeward Bound groups can tell stories of hope and what it means to persevere through the worst of circumstances.": "有时候，漫长的旅程可能看起来不可能完成，甚至会动摇最坚定的旅行者的信念。以归途同行者（Homeward Bound）团体为特色的冒险活动可以讲述希望的故事，以及在最糟糕的情况下坚持不懈的意义。",
	"The characters hear tales of a legendary creature that can travel across vast distances in the blink of an eye. If they can track it down, it might be their way home.": "角色们听说了一个传说中的生物，它可以在眨眼间穿越广阔的距离。如果他们能追踪到它，也许这就是他们回家的方法。",
	"A creature of questionable motives offers the characters a deal: the creature will give the characters access to a power that can help their group, but first they must do something dangerous for the creature.": "一个动机可疑的生物向角色们提出交易：这个生物将给予角色们一种能力，可以帮助他们的小组，但首先他们必须为这个生物做一些危险的事情。",

	"Stories involving warden groups typically include elements related to preservation or duty, depending on the characters' ward and the circumstances of their appointment as its wardens. These story elements emphasize the constant tightrope of duty and personal desire that a group of wardens is bound to feel. Keep in mind, the characters' ward doesn't need to be in direct danger to challenge the characters or for them to be invested in a quest or story arc. For example, characters whose ward is a diplomat might be challenged with adapting to the different cultures the diplomat visits or with overcoming environmental hazards as they escort the diplomat across the land or sea. Similarly, characters whose ward is a location might have to deal with those who want to besmirch the storied location's history or defame the wardens themselves.": "通常涉及守卫团体的故事会包含与保护或责任相关的元素，这取决于角色的守护对象以及他们被任命为守卫的情况。这些故事元素强调了守卫团体所感受到的责任和个人欲望之间不断的平衡。请记住，角色的守护对象并不一定需要直接处于危险之中才能挑战角色，或让他们投入到一个任务或故事情节中。例如，如果角色的守护对象是一位外交官，他们可能会面临适应外交官访问的不同文化，或者在护送外交官穿越陆地或海洋时克服环境危险的挑战。同样，如果角色的守护对象是一个地点，他们可能不得不应对那些想要诽谤这个历史悠久地点的历史或诽谤守卫们自己的人。",

	"Wardens are tasked with guarding something, often defying interference or any change affecting their ward. However, the entropic nature of the world demands that all things must change, fade, or fall apart eventually. Wardens tasked with protecting something ancient or aging might struggle with the effort to preserve it (or even question if it is worth the effort) against astronomical odds.": "守护者被赋予守护某物的任务，通常要抵御干扰或任何影响其守护对象的变化。然而，世界的熵性质要求所有事物最终都必须改变、消逝或崩溃。负责保护古老或年迈事物的守护者可能会在努力保护它（甚至质疑是否值得努力）时面临巨大的挑战。",
	"Unlike many adventuring groups who meet under random circumstances, wardens begin their adventures with an enormous responsibility already guiding their actions. Having to put the needs of something else before your own can chafe in the bad moments and can feel impossible on the darkest days. Such stories can explore what it means to be trusted with something so important and how each character handles the weight of that responsibility.": "与许多冒险团在随机情况下相遇不同，守护者们在开始冒险时已经肩负着巨大的责任，指引着他们的行动。在困难时刻必须把别人的需求放在自己之前，可能会让人感到不安，甚至在最黑暗的日子里会感到不可能。这样的故事可以探讨被委以如此重要任务意味着什么，以及每个角色如何承担这份责任的重量。",

They have to figure out why this previous warden is suddenly asking questions and whether or not to trust them.": "一位前监狱长突然联系了角色，对他们当前的任务状态显得有些过于感兴趣。他们必须弄清楚为什么这位前监狱长突然询问问题，以及是否应该相信他们。",
	"A different group of wardens contacts the characters, claiming that they could do better than the characters at defending their ward. The characters must deal with the rival group before the group starts drawing too much attention.": "另一组看守人联系了角色，声称他们可以比角色更好地保护他们的区域。角色必须在这个对手团体引起太多关注之前处理好他们。",

	"A weapon is more than the damage it deals. In combat, skilled warriors use their weapons to confuse, disorient, and disadvantage their enemies before moving in for the kill. This section offers unique options for using weapons in ways other than dealing damage, giving different weapons distinct impacts on the battlefield.": "武器不仅仅是它造成的伤害。在战斗中，熟练的战士会利用他们的武器来混淆、使敌人迷失方向，并在最后致命一击前让对手处于不利地位。这一部分提供了独特的选项，可以让武器在战场上以非伤害方式发挥作用，使不同的武器在战场上产生不同的影响。",
	"A character can use a weapon option only if the character is wielding and is proficient with a weapon that meets the weapon option's prerequisites. Some weapons can be used to perform certain weapon options even if the weapon doesn't ordinarily meet the option's prerequisites, as noted in the weapon option's entry. If an option requires a creature to make an ability check or saving throw, the DC equals 8 + the attacker's proficiency bonus + the attacker's Strength or Dexterity modifier (attacker's choice).": "一个角色只能使用武器选项，如果角色握持并精通符合武器选项先决条件的武器。一些武器可以用来执行特定的武器选项，即使武器通常不符合选项的先决条件，如武器选项条目中所述。如果一个选项要求生物进行能力检定或豁免才能，DC等于8 + 攻击者的熟练加值 + 攻击者的力量或敏捷调整值（攻击者选择）。",
	"Unless specified otherwise, a weapon used to perform a weapon option has only the option's listed effect and doesn't deal normal weapon damage. If a weapon option instructs a character to make an attack with the weapon, and the character can make multiple attacks with the Attack action, the weapon option replaces only one of those attacks.": "除非另有规定，用于执行武器选项的武器仅具有选项列出的效果，不造成普通武器伤害。如果武器选项指示角色使用武器进行攻击，并且角色可以使用攻击动作进行多次攻击，则武器选项仅替换其中一次攻击。",

On a failed save, the creature takes {@damage 5d8} bludgeoning damage and is knocked {@condition prone}. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet away from the space through which the vehicle passed. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

	"No creature epitomizes the art of graceful service like the courtfolk, an accomplishment these halflings take with great (but quiet) pride. Courtfolk are defined by their dedication and deference to great courts, particularly elven courts. Their complexion is usually pale and freckled with light-colored eyes and curly mops of hair. They prefer neat, well-tailored clothing with touches of courtly inspiration without ever descending into gaudy imitation. Colors are pastel or forest tones and muted, befitting a servant, but never drab. Courtfolk are not motivated by material wealth or luxury, finding genuine contentment in simple things, but what they do keep, they desire to be of fine quality. They take pains to care for their clothing, family heirlooms, musical instruments, work implements, and other valued possessions.": "没有什么生物比得上庭臣这样优雅地展现出服务的艺术，这是半身人以极大（但低调）自豪感所取得的成就。庭臣以对伟大法庭的奉献和尊敬为定义，尤其是精灵法庭。他们通常皮肤苍白，布满雀斑，眼睛浅色，头发卷曲。他们喜欢整洁、裁剪合身的服装，带有法庭灵感的点缀，但绝不会堕入俗气的模仿。颜色以柔和的粉色或森林色调为主，低调而不沉闷，适合作为仆人，但绝不单调。庭臣并不被物质财富或奢华所驱使，他们在简单的事物中找到了真正的满足，但他们所保留的东西，他们希望是高质量的。他们费心照料他们的衣物、家族传世之物、乐器、工具和其他宝贵的财物。",
	"Courtfolk maintain servitude was never forced upon them but freely chosen, even though many courtfolk no longer serve. This belief, true or not, gives them a sense of agency and relevance to their servitude. The profound delight the courtfolk derive from being of service to others and in performing a job well stems from knowing they have controlled their destiny. Service is an honor to the courtfolk, and service comes to them out of compassion rather than fear or awe (although certainly individual courtfolk may come to fear or worship their masters based on treatment).": "法庭人民坚称他们从未被强迫接受服侍，而是自愿选择的，尽管许多法庭人民不再服侍。这种信念，无论真实与否，都让他们对自己的服侍有一种主动性和相关性的感觉。法庭人民从为他人服务和出色完成工作中获得的深刻喜悦源于他们知道自己掌控了自己的命运。服务对法庭人民来说是一种荣誉，服务来自于他们的同情，而不是恐惧或敬畏（尽管个别法庭人民可能会因为对待而开始害怕或崇拜他们的主人）。",
	"The courtfolk adventurer is a courtfolk who no longer serves or whose family no longer serves. Such adventurers tend to be motivated by one of two things: loyalty to an ally or generating money to look after their families. A courtfolk is a dauntless ally and comrade-in-arms and never aims to steal the credit for their friends' derring-do. Their loyalty and practicality make them faithful companions in the heart of a dungeon as much as an intrigue-steeped noble court.": "法庭民冒险者是一位不再为法庭服务或其家族不再为法庭服务的法庭民。这样的冒险者往往受到两种动机之一的驱使：对盟友的忠诚或为了照顾家人而赚钱。法庭民是无畏的盟友和战友，永远不会试图窃取朋友们英勇行为的功劳。他们的忠诚和实用主义使他们成为地牢深处和充满阴谋的贵族法庭中忠实的伴侣。",
	"Due to their ancient connection with elven courts, courtfolk names have an obvious elven influence. Their given names have a notably softer and lilting flair than other halflings.

In the early days of the Southlands, Bastet the cat queen and Gamka the lion-headed titan breathed life into tufts of fur plucked from the goddess's tail and the titan's mane. The power of these two children of the primordial Aurgelmir, the giant whose body became Midgard itself, worked to shape the first catfolk. However, the brief affair soon perished to the old enmity between god and titan. Central to their contentionwas the final form of the catfolk. Bastet desired these new creations to resemble her beloved cats while Gamka pushed for the fierce lions. After a brief but violent quarrel, the two divine beings went their separate ways, each taking some of the new mortals for themselves and shaping them according to their own whims. Some suggest Bastet achieved her revenge by engineering the fall of the titan empire, but others disagree, claiming the Cat Goddess would never be so blatant.

	"Given the small populations of the malkins and pantherans and their similarities with basteti, most believe they are off-shoots of the basteti, especially because Midgard pantherans never appear leonine. Many malkins and pantherans also hold this to be true and become devout followers of Bastet. Some families, however, have different stories for their origins. For some malkin families, their legends state the malkin were created by Loki, who was enamored with the natural curiosity and mischievousness of small cats. For some pantheran families, their legends state the pantherans were created by the ancient forests of Midgard as protectors of the natural world, though which forest birthed the first pantherans varies by family. Regardless of the stories, Bastet embraces all catfolk, and Loki's favor is rarely out of reach for those seeking to cause mischief. As for the forests of Midgard, few can understand the wills and powers of these mysterious entities, and even they aren't privy to all the forests' secrets.": "考虑到马尔金(%num%)和豹人(%num%)的人口较少，以及它们与巴斯泰蒂的相似之处，大多数人认为它们是巴斯泰蒂的分支，尤其是因为中加德的豹人从未呈现出狮子般的特征。许多马尔金和豹人也认同这一观点，并成为巴斯泰蒂的虔诚信徒。然而，一些家族对自己的起源有不同的传说。对于一些马尔金家族来说，他们的传说称马尔金是由洛基创造的，洛基着迷于小猫的自然好奇心和调皮。对于一些豹人家族来说，他们的传说称豹人是由中加德古老的森林创造的，作为自然界的守护者，尽管哪片森林孕育了第一批豹人因家族而异。无论传说如何，巴斯泰蒂都欢迎所有猫族，而洛基的青睐对于那些寻求捣蛋的人来说几乎是触手可及的。至于中加德的森林，很少有人能理解这些神秘实体的意愿和力量，即使它们也不知晓所有森林的秘密。",

Their empire maintains complex social structures and forges serious alliances. They scheme and plot. They hunger for the flesh of the living. They are the ghoulish darakhul.": "在地下黑暗的深处，一个充满吞噬野心的帝国正在茁壮成长、策划和梦想。他们的城市隐藏在视线之外，他们的特工渗透到数十个地表城市的地下世界，他们的目标无限。对于他们来说，如果你不是他们帝国的一员，你就是食物。他们的帝国保持着复杂的社会结构，建立着严肃的联盟。他们密谋策划。他们渴望活人的血肉。他们就是那些可怕的(`darakhul`)食尸鬼。",

Maintaining their state requires envoys and ambassadors, messengers and scouts, traders and commerce, as well as knowledge of events in the surface world. These undead diplomats engage with races they might otherwise consider food out of duty to the empire and with a specific purpose.": "一些达拉库尔（Darakhul）冒险进入更广阔的世界，为了帝国的事务。维持他们的国家需要使节和大使、信使和侦察员、贸易商和商业活动，以及对地表世界事件的了解。这些不死族外交官与他们本来可能视为食物的种族打交道，是出于对帝国的责任和特定目的。",
	"Other members of their kind, however, have no such obligations. For adventuring darakhul, those in self-imposed exile, or those who never belonged to a darakhul empire, the quest to master their own hunger, to transcend their role as predators of sentient beings, is as much a part of their journey as the current quest. These characters typically want to grow beyond their ghoulish appetites and regain some part of their former lives in the cultures and societies of the world's surface. No one knows better than the darakhul that they can't overcome their nature unless they confront it.": "然而，他们种族的其他成员却没有这样的义务。对于那些冒险的达拉库尔，那些自我放逐的人，或者那些从未属于达拉库尔帝国的人来说，掌控自己的饥饿，超越作为有意识生物的掠食者的角色，是他们旅程的一部分。这些角色通常希望超越他们食尸鬼般的欲望，重拾世界地表文化和社会中他们以前生活的一部分。没有人比达拉库尔更清楚，除非他们面对自己的本性，否则他们无法克服它。",
	"But no matter how urbane or well-controlled the rare diplomat or merchant might seem to be, the prejudice of the living against the undead is powerful and visceral. Humanity views the darakhul with suspicion if not outright hostility, and it is difficult — but not impossible — for a darakhul to allay those fears.": "但无论多么文雅或自控的罕见外交官或商人似乎是，生者对不死族的偏见是强大且本能的。人类对达拉库尔怀有怀疑，甚至是直接的敌意，对于达拉库尔来说，要消除这些恐惧是困难的 — 但并非不可能。",
	"A quality disguise is one of the best tools for a darakhul trying to make its way among the breathing. Almost all darakhul traveling on the surface maintain a disguise kit and a concealing outfit to match their cover identity. With a good costume, a darakhul might pass unchallenged among humans for a long time. Possibilities include the wrappings of a leper, enshrouding robes, veils, or the head-to-toe garb of the desert peoples. Each of these disguises requires appropriate details to help the deception withstand scrutiny: the right language skills along with knowledge of the region and its customs.": "一个高质量的伪装是达拉库尔（Darakhul）试图在呼吸者中间行走的最佳工具之一。几乎所有在地表旅行的达拉库尔都会携带一个伪装工具包和一个与他们掩护身份相匹配的隐匿服装。有了一个好的服装，一个达拉库尔可以在人类中毫无挑战地通过很长一段时间。可能的选择包括麻风病人的绷带、裹身长袍、面纱，或者沙漠民族的从头到脚的服饰。每种伪装都需要适当的细节来帮助欺骗经受审查：正确的语言技能以及对该地区及其习俗的了解。",
	"Even a convincing disguise doesn't explain a darakhul's need to eat alone and behind closed doors. Darakhul can use cultural or religious requirements to justify such behavior in most situations. In cases where a costume and a cover identity are impractical, a skillful application of cosmetics and a few gold coins slipped into the right hands are often enough to make a request for privacy seem more reasonable. Ensuring a sufficient supply of raw meat is a challenge left to the darakhul's imagination.": "即使一个令人信服的伪装也无法解释达拉库尔（Darakhul）需要独自并在闭门之处进食的原因。在大多数情况下，达拉库尔可以利用文化或宗教要求来为这种行为辩解。在无法使用服装和掩护身份的情况下，巧妙地使用化妆品并在合适的人手中塞入一些金币通常足以使请求隐私显得更加合理。确保有足够的生肉供应是留给达拉库尔想象力的挑战。",
	"Both ordinary ghouls and darakhul arise from the infected corpses of other races. Most traits of the previous race are gone when the creature rises as a darakhul, although each darakhul carries some traits of their previous form (see the Heritage Subraces). Still, most of a darakhul's cosmetic features, such as supple skin or a long beard, fade over time into the gaunt, skull-like face, fanged maw, and taut, gray skin of a ghoulish undead.": "普通食尸鬼和达拉库尔都是从其他种族的被感染尸体中产生的。当生物作为达拉库尔升起时，大部分前一个种族的特征都消失了，尽管每个达拉库尔都保留了一些以前形态的特征（见传承亚种）。然而，大部分达拉库尔的外观特征，比如柔软的皮肤或长胡须，随着时间的推移逐渐消失，变成了瘦削的、骷髅般的面孔，尖牙的大嘴，以及灰色的紧绷皮肤，成为了一种食尸鬼般的不死生物。",
	"Before the terrible scourge of darakhul fever (see Tome of Beasts) transformed you into an undead creature, you belonged to another race. Although your undead self now rules you, some remnant of your past form clings to you, making you different from the darakhul created from other races. Sometimes you retain a trait, but more likely you now have a trait that is a corruption of one you once possessed. For example, the elemental spark in a dragonborn is perverted into one of a more necrotic bent. The luck inherent in a halfling's spirit twists into a power that brings ill fortune to their enemies.": "在可怕的达拉库尔热病（见《生物之书》）肆虐之前，将你转变为不死生物，你原本属于另一个种族。尽管你现在的不死身份控制着你，但你过去形态的某些残留仍然留在你身上，使你与从其他种族转化而来的达拉库尔有所不同。有时你会保留某种特质，但更可能的是，你现在拥有的特质是你曾经拥有的特质的一种腐化。例如，龙裔身上的元素火花被扭曲成更具死灵属性的火花。半身人精灵灵魂中固有的幸运被扭曲成一种给他们的敌人带来厄运的力量。",
	"To pass for a living creature, a darakhul needs a convincing costume, matching language and speech patterns, and appropriate mannerisms and behavior. The best tactic for most darakhul is to mimic the cultures they lived in while alive, because they have a lifetime (if a short one) of knowledge to draw on. Whether it's better to try to blend into the local culture is an open question. Someone who looks just like everyone else on the street draws less attention than someone who looks like an exotic foreigner—but a person who looks like everyone else yet acts oddly can rouse even more suspicion than the exotic stranger, especially in a crossroads of cultures where foreign travelers are common.": "为了伪装成一个活生物，达拉库尔需要一个令人信服的服装，匹配的语言和言谈模式，以及适当的举止和行为。对于大多数达拉库尔来说，最好的策略是模仿他们在生前生活的文化，因为他们有一生（虽然短暂）的知识可以借鉴。是否更好地融入当地文化是一个悬而未决的问题。一个看起来和街上其他人一模一样的人比一个看起来像异国人更不容易引起注意，但一个看起来和其他人一样却行为怪异的人可能比异国人更容易引起怀疑，尤其是在外国旅行者常见的文化交汇之地。",
	"Under normal circumstances, a darakhul with a careful disguise can move among the living without rousing suspicion. As with any ability check, dice should be brought or a challenge. If, for example, a darakhul gets involved in a chase or a battle in a crowded city market, there's a chance a bystander might notice the pallor of undead flesh beneath a flapping cloak or the rictus grin inside a deep hood that's momentarily pushed back. Palace guards inspect supplicants to the Queen more carefully than an innkeeper or a merchant inspects customers. If rumors get around that there are murderers, monsters, or darakhul loose in the city, everyone is more alert.": "在正常情况下，一个小心伪装的达拉库尔可以在活人中间行动而不引起怀疑。与任何能力检定一样，应该使用骰子或进行挑战。例如，如果一个达拉库尔卷入了在拥挤的城市市场中的追逐或战斗，有可能会有旁观者注意到飘动斗篷下的亡灵肤色，或者在暂时被推开的深色兜帽下的痉挛笑容。宫殿卫兵会比旅店老板或商人更仔细地检查向女王求助的人。如果有传言称城市中有凶手、怪物或达拉库尔在逃，每个人都会更加警惕。",
	"In those situations, the GM can call for a Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check and either compare it to the NPC's passive Perception score or make an active Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check for the NPC. Opposed checks should be reserved for those times when an NPC intently scrutinizes the character or is already suspicious. If a group of NPCs is involved, it's best to make one check with advantage for the group instead of one check per NPC.": "在这些情况下，GM可以要求进行一个魅力检定（{@skill Deception}），然后将其与NPC的被动感知分数进行比较，或者为NPC进行主动的感知检定（智力{@skill Perception}检定）。对抗性检定应该保留给NPC专注地审视角色或已经怀疑的情况。如果涉及一组NPC，最好为整个组进行一次带有优势的检定，而不是为每个NPC进行一次检定。",
	"Life as the ravenous undead comes with challenges for an adventurer. People revile the darakhul universally as scavengers at best and as loathsome, murdering abominations at worst. For such a being, participating as a member of an adventuring party is complicated. To survive on the daylit surface of the world, a darakhul must be clever and thorough.": "作为一个贪婪的不死族，对于冒险者来说充满了挑战。人们普遍鄙视达拉库尔，最多只把他们当作食腐者，最坏的时候则视为令人厌恶、凶残的怪物。对于这样的存在来说，作为冒险队的一员是复杂的。为了在世界的白昼表面生存，达拉库尔必须聪明而彻底。",
	"One of the touchstones that provides stability in your new form is your old life. While you have urges and thoughts that are dark and terrible, memories and feelings from your life before undeath might resurface to help you cope. Sometimes these flashes are corrupted versions of your old self, manifesting in your mind in new ways. Other times the recollections and feelings bubble up unfiltered, reminding you of a time when you were alive. Both are painful, but pain can be instructive.": "在你新的形态中提供稳定的一个基石是你的旧生活。虽然你有黑暗和可怕的冲动和想法，但来自不死之前生活的记忆和感情可能会重新浮现，帮助你应对。有时这些闪回是你旧自我的被腐化版本，在你的脑海中以新的方式显现。而有时这些回忆和感情会无过滤地涌现，提醒你曾经活着的时光。这两者都是痛苦的，但痛苦也能成为教诲。",
	"A major question you have to answer when you play a darakhul is, \"How am I dealing with the change that transformed me into a darakhul?\" Have you fully accepted your new situation, embracing your new powers and hungers as a boon? Do you fight against your urges daily, seeking to return to your old self? What were your goals before your transformation, and do you still pursue them? Are your new goals simply about survival, or are those aspirations a twisted reflection of the goals you had as a living creature?": "当你扮演一个达拉库尔时，你必须回答的一个重要问题是，“我如何应对使我变成达拉库尔的变化？” 你是否完全接受了你的新处境，将你的新力量和渴望视为一种恩赐？你是否每天都在与自己的冲动作斗争，试图恢复到以前的自己？在变身之前，你的目标是什么，你是否仍在追求这些目标？你的新目标是否只是为了生存，还是这些愿望是你作为一个生物时的目标的扭曲反映？",
	"Regardless of your current monstrous state, who you once were has a powerful effect on who you are now. The carefree spirit of a halfling, the fiendish urges of a tiefling, or the creative spark of a gnome: all of these do not leave you simply because of your new form. How do those traits manifest themselves in your now?": "无论你现在是怪物的形态如何，你曾经是谁对你现在的影响是强大的。一个半身人的无忧无虑精神，一个魔鬼血统的恶魔冲动，或者一个侏儒的创造性火花：所有这些特质并不会仅仅因为你的新形态而消失。这些特质如何在你现在体现出来呢？",
	"There is a great deal of narrative, dramatic, and roleplaying potential in that tension between the old self and the new. Darakhul may be undead, but they still must function in their own society—be it on the surface or in the empires beneath the surface. Most still have jobs to do and dreams to fulfill within their societies.": "在旧我和新我之间的紧张关系中存在着丰富的叙事、戏剧和角色扮演潜力。达拉库尔可能是不死族，但他们仍然必须在自己的社会中发挥作用——无论是在地表上还是在地下帝国中。大多数人仍然有工作要做，有梦想要在自己的社会中实现。",
	"Deep beneath the earth, the derro wait in twisted cities built by their mad architects. These insane humanoids live, work, and somehow thrive in the lightless depths. They understand the truth about the uncaring gods that dwell between the stars, and they abandoned sanity long ago to save themselves. The derro hide within their insanity in the hope that the dark gods they fear will turn that sinister attention to other, saner races first.": "深入地下，德罗人在由他们疯狂的建筑师建造的扭曲城市中等待。这些疯狂的人形生物生活、工作，以某种方式在无光的深处茁壮成长。他们了解居住在星际之间的冷漠神灵的真相，他们早已放弃了理智以拯救自己。德罗人隐藏在他们的疯狂之中，希望他们所害怕的黑暗神灵会先将那邪恶的注意力转向其他更理智的种族。",
	"Despite the great distances between their underground cities and the surface, derro outposts can be found in the slums of many cities, both above and below ground. Occasionally, a derro discovers the wider world and finds a path out of the madness.": "尽管地底城市与地表之间距离遥远，但德罗前哨站可以在许多城市的贫民窟中找到，无论是地上还是地下。偶尔会有德罗发现更广阔的世界，并找到一条走出疯狂的道路。",
	"The derro are stunted, dwarflike humanoids, small of stature with wide shoulders and stubby limbs. They stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, with males only slighter taller than females on average. Their slender builds rarely weigh more than 40 pounds. Their pale skin is nearly translucent, revealing a ghostly web of blue veins. Their large, pure white staring eyes gleam in the dark.": "矮人族（derro）是一种矮小的类人生物，身材矮小，肩宽短肢。他们身高在3到4英尺之间，男性平均只比女性略高一点。他们纤细的体格很少超过40磅。他们苍白的皮肤几乎透明，露出一条幽灵般的蓝色血管网。他们的大眼睛纯白，在黑暗中闪闪发光。",
	"Shorter than surface dwarves, derro are quick and erratic in their movements. Their elaborately braided or styled hair ranges from white to a pale straw color. Males take great pride in their prodigious mustaches, which are often braided and waxed.": "比地面矮人更矮小，德罗（derro）在行动上迅速而不规律。他们精心编织或设计的头发颜色从白色到淡黄色不等。男性以自己浓密的胡须为傲，通常会将其编织并打蜡。",
	"The true history of the derro is an incomprehensible tangle. The entire race embraced insanity long ago. Even when they keep records, their accounts conflict with each other and with observable reality. The various cults and clans of the derro embrace a wide variety of myths, mostly passed along by oral tradition and mind-bending artwork. Every new teller of a given tale twists or rewrites portions of the story to fit their own warped view of the world.": "德洛族的真实历史是一个难以理解的纷乱。整个种族很久以前就拥抱了疯狂。即使他们保留记录，他们的记载也会相互矛盾，与观察到的现实也不符。德洛族的各种教派和家族信奉各种神话，大多通过口头传统和扭曲思维的艺术作品传承下来。每一个讲述同一故事的新人都会扭曲或重新编写故事的部分，以适应他们自己对世界的扭曲看法。",
	"The derro have existed for ages, perhaps thriving even before the spread of humans across the surface. The more reliable histories of other races agree the derro were once allied with the drow. The drow regard them with a strange type of favor, almost like dim-witted children. The aboleths and duergar have historically used and abused the derro. The derro know no actual friends, but they are overawed by power and dominance. They serve beings whose assumed superiority impresses them, and, when led in this way, their insanity clears enough to keep them moving toward the leader's goals.": "德洛族已经存在了很久，甚至可能在人类蔓延到地表之前就已繁荣。其他种族更可靠的历史记录表明，德洛族曾经与卓尔联盟。卓尔对他们抱有一种奇怪的喜爱，几乎像对待愚蠢的孩子一样。深渊领主和灰矮人在历史上曾经利用和虐待德洛族。德洛族没有真正的朋友，但他们对权力和统治感到敬畏。他们侍奉那些被认为更为优越的存在，当以这种方式领导时，他们的疯狂会足够清晰，以便朝着领导者的目标前进。",
	"Love, as other races know it, is unheard of in the bizarre core family unit of the derro. Derro children are born sane, but they are deliberately driven mad by their relatives, usually by age four. Parents feed, clothe, and protect their children not out of a sense of love or tenderness, but because they know that every derro awakened to the mind-bending truth of their race brings them glory. The horrific rituals that break a young derro's sanity vary by tribe and even year to year. Details are sparse, but known ritual names include Staring into the Void, Enduring the Heartless Fire, and the First Drink of True Knowledge.": "在derro族群的古怪核心家庭单位中，爱，就像其他种族所了解的那样，是闻所未闻的。Derro的孩子出生时是理智的，但通常在四岁左右被他们的亲戚故意逼疯。父母喂养、给孩子穿衣、保护他们并不是出于爱或温柔的感觉，而是因为他们知道每一个觉醒到他们种族扭曲真相的derro都会给他们带来荣耀。摧毁年幼derro理智的可怕仪式因部落而异，甚至每年都可能有所不同。细节很少，但已知的仪式名称包括凝视虚空、忍受无情之火和真知的初次饮用。",
	"Derro are paranoid, unstable, and jittery, and many suffer powerful delusions of grandeur as well. Madness compels them to commit acts of cruelty against their companions or pets, and these acts ignite constant infighting among them. A few, however, muster enough restraint and control to keep the entirety of derro society from crumbling.": "矮人(Derro)是偏执、不稳定和神经质的，许多人还患有严重的夸大妄想。疯狂驱使他们对同伴或宠物犯下残忍的行为，这些行为引发了他们之间持续不断的内讧。然而，少数人能够保持足够的克制和控制，以避免整个矮人社会的崩溃。",
	"Savants are powerful sorcerers who hold their madness at bay long enough to cobble together coherent plans, though even they are dangerously unpredictable. The derro's antipaladins are terrifying engines of crazed destruction who have looked deep into the void between stars and survived—and even the savants respect them for that. Clans that stick together long enough inadvertently create a witch queen among their ranks, a collective spirit of the clan. These derro become the leaders and central focuses of their clans, driving the clan to inscrutable ends. When one witch queen dies, her spirit transfers to another derro in the clan, transforming that derro into the next witch queen and perpetuating the clan.": "智者是强大的术士，能够控制住他们的疯狂，足够长的时间来拼凑出连贯的计划，尽管他们本身也是极具危险性的。德洛的黑武士是可怕的疯狂毁灭机器，曾深入星际之间的虚空并幸存下来，即使智者们也对他们表示尊敬。长时间团结在一起的氏族会无意中在他们的成员中培养出一个女巫女王，成为氏族的集体精神。这些德洛会成为他们氏族的领袖和核心焦点，驱使氏族朝着难以捉摸的目标前进。当一位女巫女王死去时，她的灵魂会转移到氏族中的另一位德洛身上，将那个德洛转变为下一位女巫女王，延续氏族的存在。",
	"The derro worship a horde of bizarre and terrible beings, including demon lords. Perhaps the most disturbing of their deities are the Great Old Ones whose mere symbolic presence melts minds and corrupts the world. Derro worshipers venerate Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods, in particular. There is no pattern or reason that governs which dark being will catch a given derro's fancy, and devotees are violently hostile to worshipers of other entities.": "狄罗族崇拜一群奇异而可怕的存在，包括恶魔领主。也许最令人不安的他们的神明是那些伟大的古老存在，他们的象征性存在就能融化思维并腐化世界。狄罗的崇拜者尤其崇拜尼亚拉萨特普 (Nyarlathotep) 和森林黑山羊 (Shub-Niggurath)，没有规律或理由能解释为何某个黑暗存在会引起某个狄罗的兴趣，而信徒们对其他实体的崇拜者极具暴力倾向。",
	"Derro consider themselves the most exalted servants of the blasphemous figures they venerate; the only beings in the entire multiverse who can truly understand their deity's glory. Specific rituals vary from cult to cult, but the unifying thread of derro faith asserts that their racial madness is a gift that makes communion with these deities possible. Further, the derro believe they are the harbingers of shattered husk of creation.": "矮人族认为自己是他们所崇拜的亵渎人物最崇高的仆人；是整个多元宇宙中唯一能真正理解他们神明荣耀的存在。具体的仪式因教派而异，但矮人族信仰的统一主线是他们种族的疯狂是一种礼物，使得与这些神明交流成为可能。此外，矮人族相信他们是创世之残骸的先兆。",
	"Derro are unpredictable, fanciful, and prone to delusions, confusions, and manias. So how can they function in groups more accustomed to the stability of humans, dwarves, and elves?": "矮人(Derro)是不可预测的，异想天开的，容易产生妄想、混乱和狂躁。那么他们如何能够在更习惯于人类、矮人和精灵稳定性的团体中发挥作用呢？",
	"In truth, the derro are less violent and more peculiar in a quieter way than their common portrayal as rabid maniacs. They are as likely to be brooding, depressed, or sullen as crazed and violent. Your derro character could have a tendency to talk to themselves, might address an invisible friend before undertaking any major step, or might simply consider all the other members of the party as \"imaginary friends\" and thus not subject to harassment.": "事实上，矮人(derro)比起作为狂热疯子的普遍形象更少暴力，更多地展现出一种更为怪异的安静方式。他们可能像疯狂和暴力一样，也可能是忧郁、沮丧或愁眉苦脸。你的矮人角色可能有和自己对话的倾向，在采取任何重要步骤之前可能会和一个看不见的朋友交谈，或者可能简单地把队伍中的其他成员都视为“虚构的朋友”，因此不会受到骚扰。",
	"Treat the derro's madness as an occasional bit of flavor for the character, rather than an excuse to cripple the party with chaotic and self-defeating actions. A derro character won't be as predictable as a dwarf paladin or a half-elf bard, but the derro might occasionally talk to rocks and interrogate mushrooms. Review the {@table Minor Madnesses|ToH} for examples of playable and flavorful maladies that afflict your character. Choose an appropriate minor madness or roll percentile dice to randomly determine it. Your character should have at least one minor madness, but check with your GM to confirm how many and which minor madnesses are most appropriate in your campaign.": "将derro的疯狂视为角色偶尔的一点风味，而不是借口让团队陷入混乱和自我毁灭的行为。 与矮人圣武士或半精灵诗人一样，derro角色不会像预测那么准确，但derro可能会偶尔与岩石交谈并审问蘑菇。 请查看{@table Minor Madnesses|ToH}，了解影响你角色的可玩和有趣的疾病的示例。 选择一个适当的轻微疯狂，或者通过掷百分骰随机确定。 你的角色应该至少有一个轻微疯狂，但请与你的GM确认在你的游戏中哪些轻微疯狂最合适，以及需要多少个。",
	"To avoid derailing the party constantly, your character can have long lucid periods and might even regret actions taken when \"turned to the dark void\" or \"ridden by the bat spirits\" or a similar explanation. A derro in this lucid state could be a tragic character, always wondering when something will set off another bout of irrational raving. Keep in mind, derro are often awed by beings they see as powerful, though each derro defines what they deem as \"powerful.\" Your derro character could view another member of the group as the group's \"witch queen\" (regardless of that character's gender) and follow that character almost zealously. The instability of the derro could also lead your character to choose a different member of the group each day or each week as the current \"witch queen.\"": "为了避免不断使派对偏离轨道，你的角色可以有长时间清醒的时期，甚至可能会后悔在\"陷入黑暗虚空\"或\"被蝙蝠精灵附身\"等情况下采取的行动，或类似的解释。在这种清醒状态下，derro可能是一个悲剧性角色，总是担心什么会引发下一次非理性的胡言乱语。请记住，derro经常对他们视为强大的存在感到敬畏，尽管每个derro都会定义他们认为什么是\"强大\"。你的derro角色可能会把团队中的另一个成员视为团队的\"女巫女王\"（不论该角色的性别），并几乎狂热地追随该角色。derro的不稳定性也可能导致你的角色每天或每周选择团队中的另一个成员作为当前的\"女巫女王\"。",
	"Playing a derro character involves making a fantasy form of otherworldly madness both playable and plausible. Find a way to make your character memorable without bogging down play or spoiling everyone else's game.": "扮演一个德罗(%(Derro)%)角色意味着要创造一个充满幻想的、超凡脱俗的疯狂形象，既可玩又合理。要找到一种让你的角色令人难忘，但又不会拖累游戏或破坏其他人游戏体验的方式。",
	"Names are thrust upon derro children haphazardly and with no clear general customs. Derro who worship an ancestor god might give their children a variation on the exalted figure's name or title, or a child might grow almost to maturity before any adult bothers to call them by the same jumble of sounds twice. Clan, tribe, and family names also lack any discernable pattern, though occasionally they form a coherent description.": "狂热的德罗族人会给他们的孩子取一个祖先神的名字或头衔的变体，或者一个孩子在几乎成年之前都没有成年人用相同的一堆声音来叫他们。氏族、部落和家族的名字也没有任何明显的模式，尽管偶尔它们会形成一个连贯的描述。",

	"Drow structures are built with materials as fine and as strong as spider webs. Their fortifications are like the colonies of ants: defensible and carefully planned.

	"At first, the territories controlled by the darakhul did not intersect with that of the drow. As the darakhul spread further and further throughout the caverns beneath the surface, skirmishes between the outer guard and advance scouts of the drow and darakhul became more frequent.

	"The drow had never before been successfully invaded, but they had never before been attacked by a force like the darakhul.

The delvers are the workers who maintain the (once) magnificent drow cities, serve in the drow military, and keep the rest of the drow safe and fed. The purified make up the leaders, skilled laborers, and magic-users of the drow. With the war between the drow and the darakhul going so poorly, a new and growing population of drow, called the fever-bit, have been infected with darakhul fever and survived, changing them into something quite new—and potentially powerful.": "黑暗精灵通常出生在不同的种姓中，这决定了他们在黑暗精灵社会中的期望。探索者是维护（曾经）辉煌的黑暗精灵城市、在黑暗精灵军队中服役以及保护其他黑暗精灵安全和供养的工作者。净化者则是黑暗精灵的领袖、熟练劳动者和魔法使用者。随着黑暗精灵与达拉库尔之间的战争进展不顺利，一群新兴的黑暗精灵人口，被称为热病者，感染了达拉库尔热并幸存下来，使他们变成了一种全新的——潜在强大的生物。",

Or so the erina druids like to claim.": "神秘的刺猬人族将他们的历史追溯到世界的开始——甚至比精灵追溯到的更久远——追溯到最初的树丛和荒野草原，追溯到那些元素极点之间诞生一切的绿色之地。至少艾瑞娜德鲁伊们喜欢这样宣称。",
	"The erina are a small-statured race of creatures resembling bipedal hedgehogs. They often escape the notice of the powerful rulers of the land, though anyone traveling through the wilds would do well to have them as allies.": "埃里纳（Erina）是一种类似两足刺猬的小个子种族。他们经常被这片土地的强大统治者忽视，但任何穿越荒野的人都最好把他们当作盟友。",

	"Four races mastered the creation of gearforged and build gearforged in their likenesses to house the souls of their people.

	"Minotaurs are imposing and powerful, with a reputation for ferocity that borders on monstrous. They display their achievements proudly by decorating their horns with engraved sigils and designs. If one is versed in minotaur custom, one can tell at a glance the achievements and prowess of a minotaur by examining the decoration on her horns. A minotaur who loses part or all of a horn suffers considerable stigma and must strive to prove their worth. Sometimes a \"brokehorn\" (a fighting insult to any minotaur) who manages to achieve great deeds earns the gift of having the missing horn magically restored by a temple. Beware any minotaur that willingly gives up or chooses not to restore a lost horn, for this is one of the world's most driven and dangerous creatures.": "牛头人是令人敬畏和强大的，以凶猛而近乎怪物般的名声而闻名。他们通过在角上雕刻符号和图案来自豪地展示自己的成就。如果了解牛头人的习俗，通过检查她角上的装饰，可以一眼看出牛头人的成就和实力。一个失去部分或全部角的牛头人会遭受相当大的污名，并必须努力证明自己的价值。有时，一个成功取得伟大业绩的“断角者”（对任何牛头人来说都是一种战斗侮辱）可能会获得由寺庙魔法恢复缺失角的礼物。要当心任何自愿放弃或选择不恢复失去角的牛头人，因为这是世界上最有动力和危险的生物之一。",
	"Minotaurs are a force to be reckoned with in a stand-up fight. Perhaps somewhat against type for their bulk, they are an absolute terror on the sea. Their corsairs have carved a tale of bloody blades and shattered hulls on the water, and even the world's mightiest navies have learned to respect them. The minotaur's natural sense of direction makes them ideal navigators on sea as well as land. Cover of night, fog thick enough to carve, and unfamiliar coastlines don't phase the bull-folk.": "牛头人在正面战斗中是一股不可忽视的力量。也许有点违背他们的体型特点，但在海上他们绝对是一种恐怖存在。他们的海盗曾在海上刻下了一段血腥刀剑和破碎船体的传奇，甚至世界上最强大的海军也学会尊重他们。牛头人天生的方向感使他们在海上和陆地上都是理想的航海员。夜晚的掩护、足以切割的浓雾和陌生的海岸线都无法让这些牛族动摇。",
	"Minotaur architecture and city planning always incorporate a particular design: labyrinths. Every settlement and structure of any size created by the bull-folk sports a twisting labyrinth of switchbacks and dead ends. In their largest cities, the city's leader or reigning monarch lives in a palace at the center of a great labyrinth. At night, the clash of arms and screams of the dying find their way out of the maze. It is said that minotaur leaders invite both friends and enemies to enjoy the hospitality of these palaces, but only their friends survive the stay.": "牛头人的建筑和城市规划总是融入了一个特殊的设计：迷宫。每个由牛头人建造的规模不小的定居点和建筑物都有一个蜿蜒曲折、充满岔路和死胡同的迷宫。在他们最大的城市中，城市的领袖或统治者住在一个位于巨大迷宫中心的宫殿里。夜晚，刀剑碰撞声和垂死者的惨叫声从迷宫中传出。据说牛头人领袖邀请朋友和敌人共享这些宫殿的款待，但只有他们的朋友能在逗留中生存下来。",
	"Most minotaurs have two names: a first name, which is often the same as their father's or mother's name, plus a descriptor. No matter how many children a minotaur has, odds are most of the males will have the same first name as their father and most of the females will have the same first name as their mother. The descriptors vary, but they're aspirational rather than earned. Since the descriptors are given by the parents when the minotaur is still an infant, they might or might not turn out to be accurate. For example, parents who want their child to be a great warrior might call it \"the Fierce.\" If that minotaur grows up to become a poet rather than a warrior, it will still be called \"the Fierce.\"": "大多数牛头人有两个名字：一个是名字，通常与父亲或母亲的名字相同，再加上一个描述词。无论牛头人有多少子女，大多数男性都会与父亲有相同的名字，而大多数女性都会与母亲有相同的名字。描述词各不相同，但都是愿景而非实际获得的。由于描述词是父母在牛头人还是婴儿时给予的，它们可能准确也可能不准确。例如，希望自己的孩子成为伟大战士的父母可能会称其为“凶猛者”。如果那个牛头人长大后成为诗人而不是战士，它仍然会被称为“凶猛者”。",

The inscrutable madness of the derro make them dangerous to creatures in reach of their domain. The calculating and dispassionate drow put their own survival above everything else. With so many inhospitable, or openly evil, forces at play, one race lives a more-or-less peaceful life in the depths of the world: the mushroomfolk.": "世界地底的洞穴充满了危险和死亡。贪婪而不可阻挡的达拉库尔(darakhul)寻求统治一切。晦涩莫测的德洛(derro)因其领地内的疯狂而对周围生物构成威胁。精明冷静的卓尔(drow)将自己的生存置于一切之上。在如此多的不友好或公开邪恶势力作用下，有一个种族在世界深处过着相对平静的生活：蘑菇人(mushroomfolk)。",
	"The physical appearance of mushroomfolk is even more diverse than their flesh-and-blood counterparts. They have evolved appendages resembling arms and legs, as well as organs for taking in sensory information. Beyond that, they can be as different from one another as surface fungi are from each other, even within the same clan. Some mushroomfolk are tall and thin with caps like toadstools, while others might be short and squat like puffballs. Their diversity strengthens the survivability of their race and their clans.": "蘑菇人的外貌比起它们的血肉同类更加多样化。它们进化出类似手臂和腿的附肢，以及用于感知信息的器官。除此之外，它们彼此之间的差异可以像地表真菌之间的差异一样大，甚至在同一个家族内部也是如此。有些蘑菇人可能又高又瘦，帽子像毒蘑菇，而另一些可能又矮又胖，像泡菇一样。它们的多样性增强了它们种族和家族的生存能力。",
	"Mushroomfolk have no gender, and they are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. Roughly once a year, a mushroomfolk is capable of creating a copy of itself via a specialized spore, which takes about 5 years to become an adult mushroomfolk. It's also possible for two mushroomfolk to combine spores and create a completely new type of mushroomfolk. This process takes longer, and usually only takes place when the clan is in a settlement phase. An adult grows from this process after about 10 years, but such individuals are considered hardier and a good omen for a clan.": "蘑菇人没有性别，能够进行性和无性繁殖。大约每年一次，蘑菇人能够通过一种特殊的孢子创造自己的复制品，这需要大约5年时间才能长成成年蘑菇人。两个蘑菇人也可以结合孢子，创造出一种全新的蘑菇人。这个过程需要更长的时间，通常只在部落处于定居阶段时发生。从这个过程中长成成年蘑菇人需要大约10年，但这样的个体被认为更为强壮，是部落的好兆头。",
	"The lives of the mushroomfolk are concerned mainly with the search for, or the tending of, sources of nutrition. This concern dictates the lifestyle, religion, ethos, and survival of the mushroomfolk. Clans of the creatures wander the depths of the world until they find an area rich in the nutrition they need to survive. If a large area of potential nutrition is found, the wandering clan changes its mode of operation. Specialists in raising creatures or farming vegetation take over, letting the scouts and wayfinders rest for a bit.": "蘑菇族的生活主要与寻找或照料营养来源有关。这种关注决定了蘑菇族的生活方式、宗教、道德观和生存。这些生物的部落在世界的深处漫游，直到找到一个富含他们所需营养的地区。如果找到了一个潜在的大片营养区，漫游的部落就会改变其运作方式。养殖生物或种植植物的专家接管工作，让侦察员和路标定位者休息一会儿。",
	"At the same time, the scouts and wanderers from other clans might encounter a settled clan. Wandering newcomers join the settled clan for a time, learn from them, share spores to strengthen the clans, and determine if the clans must combine or split to ensure optimal chances of survival.": "与此同时，来自其他氏族的侦察员和漫游者可能会遇到一个定居的氏族。漫游的新来者会暂时加入定居的氏族，向他们学习，分享孢子以加强氏族，并确定氏族是否必须合并或分裂以确保最佳生存机会。",
	"Clans may settle for a few weeks, a few months, or even a few years. At some point, however, the nutrition runs out. Then the clan switches survival modes again, repeating the process as scouts are deployed and the clan goes on the move.": "氏族可能会定居几周、几个月，甚至几年。然而，在某个时候，食物会耗尽。然后氏族再次切换到生存模式，重复这个过程，派遣侦察员，氏族开始移动。",
	"Mushroomfolk gain sustenance from death and decay. Unlike the darakhul, however, they feed on creatures and vegetation that have died naturally and started to decay. This reliance on putrescence as a form of food often seems ghoulish to outsiders—or at least it seems so until the outsider encounters the darakhul.": "蘑菇族从死亡和腐烂中获得营养。然而，与达拉库尔不同，他们以自然死亡并开始腐烂的生物和植物为食。这种以腐烂物为食的依赖通常对外人看来有点恐怖，或者至少在外人遇到达拉库尔之前是这样。",
	"During important times of the year, the mushroomfolk perform elaborate rituals involving the finding and the harvesting of food: when scouts leave or return, when important sites of sustenance are found, when scouts of other clans join or leave, or similar. Even during less important times, mushroomfolk have small rites and rituals they perform that others might not even notice. Experts in religion who watch these rituals recognize them as a spattering of rites from different faiths. The most prevalent mimic those involved in the worship of deities of death and life-death cycles. However, the mushroomfolk have no idea of the powers they are worshipping: they simply revere the forces that bring the decay and rot that they need to survive.": "在一年中重要的时刻，蘑菇人会进行精心策划的仪式，涉及寻找和收获食物：当侦察员离开或返回时，当发现重要的食物来源时，当其他氏族的侦察员加入或离开时，或类似情况。即使在不那么重要的时候，蘑菇人也会进行一些小的仪式和仪式，其他人可能甚至都没有注意到。观察这些仪式的宗教专家认出了它们是来自不同信仰的一些仪式的混合体。最普遍的模仿那些涉及崇拜死亡和生死循环的神灵的仪式。然而，蘑菇人并不知道他们正在崇拜的力量：他们只是尊敬那些带来腐烂和腐朽的力量，这些力量是他们生存所必需的。",
	"The mushroomfolk have an interesting and unique relationship with the darakhul. They are no threat to the darakhul, but nor are they a potential food source. The darakhul, on the other hand, are a tasty treat to the mushroomfolk—even when still in an undead state, but especially after they have been destroyed. This is disconcerting to the darakhul.": "蘑菇族与达拉库尔有着有趣且独特的关系。他们对达拉库尔既不构成威胁，也不是潜在的食物来源。而达拉库尔则成为蘑菇族的美味佳肴，即使是在亡灵状态下，更是在被摧毁后。这让达拉库尔感到不安。",
	"On the other hand, the trusting and placid nature of the mushroomfolk makes them a useful tool for the darakhul. Darakhul spies can count on getting honest intelligence from mushroomfolk scouts or clans they encounter. The mushroomfolk also understand that where darakhul armies march, there is often death, with rotting bodies to give them sustenance.": "另一方面，蘑菇人的信任和温和的天性使它们成为达拉库尔的有用工具。达拉库尔间谍可以指望从蘑菇人侦察员或部落那里获得诚实的情报。蘑菇人也明白，达拉库尔军队所到之处，常常伴随着死亡，有腐烂的尸体可以为它们提供营养。",
	"The close-knit nature of mushroomfolk clans generally makes the tales of mushroomfolk characters hard-luck stories. Most likely your clan was destroyed by some underground threat, and you now wander the world looking for a new family. Maybe you were exiled from your clan for some reason, and you were adopted by some other race or a group of adventurers. You even might be off on a long-term mission to collect information about an area, serving your clan in that way, and you will return only when you feel you have enough interesting information to provide.": "蘑菇人族群的紧密联系通常使蘑菇人角色的故事充满坎坷。很可能你的族群被某种地下威胁摧毁，现在你在世界各地漫游，寻找新的家庭。也许你因某种原因被流放出族群，被其他种族或一群冒险者收养。你甚至可能正在执行长期任务，收集某个地区的信息，为族群服务，只有当你觉得自己收集到足够有趣的信息时才会返回。",
	"A mushroomfolk is given a name by the clan leaders when it becomes old enough to take on important work for the clan.

They are relentless in the pursuit of knowledge, of the veneration of dark gods, and in their swift action to pursue any goal that might topple the World Tree and end a corrupt age. They are often advisors to cultists and evil priests.": "他们中的大多数努力摧毁凡人的世界，带来一切终结。他们在追求知识、崇拜黑暗神明以及迅速行动以实现任何可能推翻世界树、结束腐败时代的目标方面毫不留情。他们经常担任邪教徒和邪恶祭司的顾问。",
	"However, some of the satarre are simply in no such hurry to bring on the end of all things. Other satarre call these renegade satarre the latje, \"the slothful ones.\" Though not outwardly different from other satarre, the latje often see little purpose in destruction for its own sake, or they see their role as warning others of the dangers of the dark gods and the widening grasp of the cold, uncaring Void. Most latje are exiled from their communities or seek the company of other races, rather than remaining close to the world-ending ambitions of most of their kind. Their numbers have always been small.": "然而，一些萨塔尔（Satarre）却毫不着急地带来一切终结。其他萨塔尔称这些叛逆的萨塔尔为拉特杰（Latje），即“懒惰者”。虽然在外表上与其他萨塔尔没有明显区别，拉特杰通常认为毁灭并非唯一目的，或者他们认为自己的角色是警告他人黑暗神灵的危险以及冷漠无情虚空的蔓延。大多数拉特杰被流放出族群，或者寻求与其他种族为伴，而不愿意与大多数同类的毁灭野心保持亲近。他们的人数一直很少。",
	"The satarre know the many worlds and their connections, and they are familiar with shadow, planar doorways, and similar arcana. They are comfortable speaking with demons, devils, and heralds of darkness, for their people have long been those who turn grand and maleficent visions into plans suitable for action.": "萨塔雷族了解许多世界及其联系，熟悉阴影、平面门户和类似的奥秘。他们习惯与恶魔、魔鬼和黑暗使者交谈，因为他们的人民长期以来一直是将宏伟而邪恶的愿景转化为适合行动的计划的人。(Satarre)",
	"All satarre have a deep hatred of the volmar (also called the Children of Yggdrasil [see Creature Codex]) and the ravenfolk (see {@footnote {@i Midgard Heroes Handbook}|{@i Midgard Heroes Handbook} by Kobold Press is currently not converted for 5eTools.}), for these two have long opposed the satarre's efforts on behalf of darkness and destruction.": "所有萨塔雷族人都对沃尔玛人（又称世界树之子）和渡鸦人怀有深切的仇恨，因为这两个种族长期以来一直反对萨塔雷族人代表黑暗和毁灭的努力。",
	"The satarre are speakers of Void Speech, the language of the Great Old Ones and of creatures that live in the darkness between stars, and the whispers and invocations of dark gods that drive others mad seem not to trouble the satarre. The satarre are a friend to the darakhul, tieflings, and vampires, and satarre and derro always seem to understand one another.": "萨塔雷（Satarre）是虚空之言的说话者，这是古老伟大存在和生活在星际黑暗之间的生物的语言，而那些让其他人发狂的低语和黑暗神明的召唤似乎并不能困扰萨塔雷。萨塔雷是达拉库尔（Darakhul）、提弗林（Tieflings）和吸血鬼的朋友，而萨塔雷和德洛（Derro）似乎总是能彼此理解。",
	"Satarre names are often similar to names of the cultures where they are raised, though satarre raised on the planes or in cults of darkness or death tend toward names common to those planes or that invoke the cult's tenets. Names in Void Speech are also common and are presented below.": "Satarre（萨塔瑞）的名字通常与他们成长的文化中的名字相似，尽管在平原上或黑暗或死亡邪教中长大的Satarre倾向于使用那些平原上常见的名字或召唤邪教原则的名字。虚空之语中的名字也很常见，以下是一些例子。",
	"All satarre are given cult names, indicating which dark god their lives were dedicated to at their naming day. Such names preface the name of the cult or god with \"ai-\" and sometimes shorten the cult or god's name to two or three syllables. Most continue to serve or at least pray to these gods as adults, with varying degrees of piety. However, the latje satarre no longer use their cult names, preferring instead more neutral terms such as \"ai-Vellec\" (of the World) or \"ai-Rinska\" (the Messenger).": "所有萨塔雷都被赋予邪教名，表明他们的生命是在他们的命名日奉献给了哪位黑暗神。这些名字在邪教或神的名字前加上\"ai-\"，有时将邪教或神的名字缩短为两到三个音节。大多数成年后仍然继续侍奉或至少向这些神祈祷，虔诚程度不同。然而，拉特杰萨塔雷不再使用他们的邪教名，而更倾向于使用更中立的术语，如\"ai-Vellec（世界之神）\"或\"ai-Rinska（信使之神）\"。",

	"Life leaves echoes in its wake, whether crumbled remnants of a bygone civilization, tales of heroes and gods that spawn new beliefs, or even the echo of an individual soul left behind to haunt the living world. Fantasy worlds are no strangers to ghosts and specters that linger beyond death, but sometimes a person's passion, purpose, and will to live are so strong, their tie to the living world so unbreakable, that their memories create a vessel for their soul after their body dies. These people are called shades. Shades can arise from any living race.": "生命在其轨迹中留下回响，无论是一个已逝文明的残迹，英雄和神灵的传说，诞生新信仰，还是一个个体灵魂的回响，留在世间萦绕。幻想世界中并不陌生于超越死亡的幽灵和幻影，但有时一个人的激情、目的和生存意志是如此强大，他们与世间的联系是如此牢不可破，以至于他们的记忆在身体死后为他们的灵魂创造了一个容器。这些人被称为阴影。阴影可以出现在任何生命种族中。",
	"There are rumors of darakhul or other undead leaving shades behind after destruction, but there are no reliable accounts of such a creature. It is more likely that an undead creature with strong enough will to become a shade becomes a shade of the race they were in true life.": "有传言称达拉库尔或其他不死生物在被摧毁后会留下暗影，但没有可靠的记录证实这种生物的存在。更有可能的是，一个不死生物如果有足够强大的意志力成为暗影，那么它会成为其真实生前所属种族的暗影。",
	"A shade possesses a physical body that looks, acts, and feels similar to a living member of their original race, at least superficially. Shades must breathe, consume food and drink, and require shelter from adverse weather. Despite the functional similarities to a living body, a shade isn't composed of flesh and blood. Their bodies are a memory of who they once were, inhabited and quickened by the presence of their soul. Exhaustion, deprivation, and injury take their toll on a shade's body, disrupting their body's ability to maintain the connection to their soul. Food, drink, and air aren't necessary to nourish their bodies but merely to help them maintain the sense of being a living, breathing creature. Similarly, shades appear to sleep, but they do not require it.": "一位阴影拥有一个看起来、行为和感觉类似于其原始种族中的活着成员的物质身体，至少在表面上是如此。阴影必须呼吸、摄取食物和饮料，并需要避开恶劣天气。尽管在功能上类似于活体，但阴影并非由血肉构成。他们的身体是他们曾经是谁的记忆，由他们的灵魂所居住和赋予生命。疲惫、匮乏和受伤会对阴影的身体造成影响，干扰其身体维持与灵魂连接的能力。食物、饮料和空气并非必需品来滋养他们的身体，而仅仅是帮助他们保持作为一个有生命、有呼吸的生物的感觉。同样，阴影似乎会睡觉，但他们并不需要。",
	"The more injured or exhausted a shade, the less corporeal they appear. The colors of their body wash out to pale, desaturated tones, and light begins to pass through them. Blood from their wounds starts out as red and vibrant as any humanoid's, but closer to death, their wounds cease to bleed and seem to evaporate at the edges.": "伤势越重或者精疲力竭的(阴影)(shade)，它们的实体性就会越来越不明显。它们身体的颜色会变得苍白，变得不饱和，光线开始透过它们。它们伤口的血液一开始是和任何人形生物一样鲜艳的红色，但临近死亡时，它们的伤口停止流血，似乎在边缘蒸发消失。",
	"A shade's remembrance of their own life, their own self, is the key to their continued existence. When others honor their memory, a shade can draw sustenance and strength from it. Any token, gift, or even a work of art or poetry intended to honor the memory of the shade carries the giver or creator's memory and can sustain the shade.": "一个阴影对自己生命、自我的回忆，是它继续存在的关键。当他人尊重他们的记忆时，阴影可以从中汲取养分和力量。任何旨在纪念阴影记忆的标志、礼物，甚至是一件艺术品或诗歌，都可以承载赠送者或创作者的记忆，并能维系阴影的存在。",
	"Creating a true {@item memento mori|ToH} requires that the creator have a genuine desire to honor the shade. It might seem trivial for a shade's bard companion to compose poems or songs regularly, thus sustaining the shade, but such attempts fail. Memory is the key, and a creator who is in regular close contact with the shade draws more on that contact than on their own memory. A shade's traveling companion painting a portrait of the shade during their travels will never become a {@item memento mori|toh}, but a handmade twine bracelet given by a villager after the shade saved their village might if the shade moves on. Above all, a true, empowered memento mori must carry meaning.": "创造一个真正的{@item memento mori|ToH}需要创作者真诚地希望尊重这个阴影。对于一个阴影的吟游诗人伴侣定期创作诗歌或歌曲似乎微不足道，从而维持这个阴影，但这样的尝试会失败。记忆是关键，一个经常与阴影密切接触的创作者会更多地依赖这种联系，而不是他们自己的记忆。一个阴影的旅行伴侣在旅途中为阴影绘制肖像永远不会成为一个{@item memento mori|toh}，但如果阴影离开，一个村民在阴影拯救他们村庄后送给阴影的手工编织手链可能会成为{@item memento mori|toh}。最重要的是，一个真正赋予力量的memento mori必须具有意义。",
	"The strength of a shade's memory of themselves and their place in life is the core of their being. Newer shades are almost impossible to distinguish from their prior, fully-living selves. Like anything exposed to the gnawing ravages of time, however, memory fades. The older a shade gets, the memories that keep them tethered to the living world begin to fray. They might grow forgetful, losing track of where they are or what year it is. Their memories might drift together, causing them to see people around them as figures from their past.": "阴影对自己和生活定位的记忆力量是他们存在的核心。新的阴影几乎无法与他们之前完全活着的自己区分开来。然而，就像任何暴露在时间侵蚀下的事物一样，记忆会褪色。阴影变得越老，让他们与活着的世界联系的记忆开始变得薄弱。他们可能变得健忘，迷失在自己所在的地方或是年份。他们的记忆可能会混在一起，导致他们将周围的人看成是他们过去的人物。",
	"Many shades keep detailed memoirs, tending to them with the same devotion that any living creature shows seeking out food and water. Shades can theoretically live forever, but in practice, the memories that tether them to life can't hold out indefinitely. Journals and other personal mementos help shades keep hold of themselves and allow them to last longer, sometimes for centuries.": "许多阴影都保留着详细的回忆，像任何活物寻找食物和水一样，对它们进行精心呵护。阴影在理论上可以永生，但实际上，将它们与生命联系在一起的记忆无法无限期地持续下去。日记和其他个人纪念品帮助阴影保持自我，并让它们能够延续更久，有时甚至可以持续数个世纪。",
	"Because they can arise from any people, shades come from all corners of the world and from all walks of life. Station and wealth are no guarantee to help one linger on after the body's death either. It's not unheard of for a person to die only to rise as a shade with little understanding that anything changed. Some even hide or dispose of their original remains, sometimes suppressing or deeply denying the act at all, and resume their life with no disruption. Anyone could secretly, sometimes even to themselves, be a shade.": "因为阴影可以来自任何人，所以它们来自世界各个角落和各行各业。地位和财富也不能保证在身体死后继续留存。有时候一个人死后却以阴影的形式复活，却对任何事情的变化一无所知。有些人甚至会隐藏或处理掉他们的原始遗骸，有时甚至会压制或深深否认这一行为，然后继续他们的生活而毫无中断。任何人都有可能秘密地，有时甚至对自己隐瞒，成为一只阴影。",
	"Some traveling shades leave their old lives behind, particularly those who were alone in life with no one to mourn them or fuel their memory. Such shades make up the majority of adventurers. Other more established shades might set out on a quest for the means to restore their true life or to protect loved ones from a threat.": "一些旅行的阴影抛下他们的旧生活，特别是那些生前孤独无依、没有人为他们哀悼或记忆他们的人。这样的阴影构成了大多数冒险者。其他更有根基的阴影可能会踏上寻找恢复真实生命或保护所爱免受威胁的征途。",
	"The largest known concentration of shades has arisen relatively recently in the conquered kingdom of Krakovar. The death that swept from the vampires to the south and their ghoulish allies that boiled up from the earth's crevices created the perfect conditions for shades to arise. Krakovan shades engage in endless sabotage, harassment, and even outright warfare against the occupying forces of the Blood Kingdom.": "最近，在被征服的克拉科瓦王国中出现了已知最大的暗影聚集地。从南方的吸血鬼传来的死亡和从地球裂缝中涌出的尸鬼盟友所带来的破坏，创造了暗影产生的完美条件。克拉科瓦暗影参与无休止的破坏、骚扰，甚至直接与血之王国的占领军进行战争。",
	"Despite their greater frequency in Krakovar, shades remain scattered except for one place. A tiny village in the Ostre Hills, Werghart, hosts a community of shades. It's remote and completely beneath the notice of the vampire ruling nobility because a scouting force destroyed it during the conquest. The shades found it not long after and set about building themselves a new life. The Werghart shades are cut off, but they are determined and could make powerful allies in striking at the Blood Kingdom from within.": "尽管在克拉科瓦尔（Krakovar）更为频繁，但阴影们仍然散落在各处，除了一个地方。在奥斯特雷山脉（Ostre Hills）的一个小村庄，韦尔加特（Werghart），居住着一群阴影社区。这个地方偏远，完全不被吸血鬼统治贵族注意，因为一支侦察部队在征服期间摧毁了它。阴影们不久之后发现了这个地方，并开始建立自己的新生活。韦尔加特的阴影们与世隔绝，但他们意志坚定，可能成为从内部打击血族王国的强大盟友。",
	"In the Southlands, shades are more common in Nuria Natal and in Siwal, the City of Gardens. Siwali shades are great assets to the gravebinders who oversee the Necropolis, often becoming gravebinders themselves.": "在南国，阴影在努里亚纳塔尔 (Nuria Natal) 和花园之城西瓦尔 (Siwal) 更为常见。西瓦尔的阴影对监督着死城 (Necropolis) 的坟墓束缚者 (gravebinders) 来说是巨大的财富，他们经常成为坟墓束缚者自己。",
	"Barbarians who walk the Path of Booming Magnificence strive to be as lions among their people: symbols of vitality, majesty, and courage. They serve at the vanguard, leading their allies at each charge and drawing their opponents' attention away from more vulnerable members of their group. As they grow more experienced, members of this path often take on roles as leaders or in other integral positions.": "走在“雷鸣壮丽之道”(Path of Booming Magnificence)上的野蛮人努力成为他们人民中的狮子：生命力、威严和勇气的象征。他们站在最前线，领导盟友冲锋，并吸引对手的注意力，让他们的团队中更脆弱的成员免受伤害。随着经验的增长，这条道路上的成员通常会承担领导者或其他重要职位。",

The hit points regained with this feature can be applied to yourself or to another creature you touch. Alternatively, you can heal another creature you touch when you spend Hit Dice to regain hit points during a {@quickref resting|phb|2|0|short rest}, instead of applying the regained hit points to yourself. If you are under an effect that increases the amount of healing you receive when spending Hit Dice, such as a spell or feat, that effect applies to the amount of hit points the target regains. Keep in mind, some effects that increase the healing of Hit Dice happen only when those Hit Dice are spent during a {@quickref resting|phb|2|0|short rest}, like a bard's {@classFeature Song of Rest (D6)|Bard||2}.": "从3级开始，你可以使用一个动作来消耗你的一个生命骰并恢复生命值。使用这个特性恢复的生命值可以应用于你自己或者你触摸到的另一个生物身上。另外，当你在 {@quickref resting|phb|2|0|short rest} 期间消耗生命骰来恢复生命值时，你可以治疗你触摸到的另一个生物，而不是将恢复的生命值应用于自己。如果你受到一个增加你在消耗生命骰时获得治疗量的效果影响，比如一个法术或者特性，那个效果将应用于目标恢复的生命值数量。请记住，一些增加生命骰治疗效果的效果只有在这些生命骰在 {@quickref resting|phb|2|0|short rest} 期间消耗时才会发生，比如诗人的 {@classFeature Song of Rest (D6)|Bard||2}。",
	"In addition, the number of Hit Dice you regain after a {@quickref resting|phb|2|0|long rest} is equal to half your total number of Hit Dice plus one. For example, if you have four Hit Dice, you regain three spent Hit Dice, instead of two, when you finish a {@quickref resting|phb|2|0|long rest}.": "此外，每次 {@quickref resting|phb|2|0|long rest} 后你恢复的命中骰数量等于你总命中骰数量的一半加一。例如，如果你有四个命中骰，在完成 {@quickref resting|phb|2|0|long rest} 后你会恢复三个已用掉的命中骰，而不是两个。",

In addition, you regain one spent Hit Die when you finish a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short rest}.": "在10级时，如果你在{@quickref resting|phb|2|0|short rest}期间花费生命骰来恢复生命值，任何超过你的生命值上限，或者被照顾生物的生命值上限的生命值恢复，可以应用于你周围5英尺内的另一个生物。此外，当你完成{@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short rest}时，你会恢复一颗已花费的生命骰。",

	"At 18th level, you recover a number of spent Hit Dice equal to a quarter of your total Hit Dice when you finish a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short rest}. In addition, you recover all your spent Hit Dice when you finish a {@quickref resting|phb|2|0|long rest}.": "在18级时，当你完成一次{@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short rest}时，你会恢复相当于你总Hit Dice数量四分之一的已花费Hit Dice。此外，当你完成一次{@quickref resting|phb|2|0|long rest}时，你会恢复所有已花费的Hit Dice。",

In combat, roll initiative for the shrub, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you).

To those standing in or near the garden, these whispers sound like wind through leaves, but a creature can put an ear next to a bloom to hear everything the bloom whispers. The peonies have no intelligence and don't differentiate truth from lies or past from present or future. They simply repeat words spoken in the garden. For particularly old alseid peony gardens, the peonies might whisper fragments of conversations out of order or from different years.

	"You sprinkle some graveyard dirt before you and call forth vengeful spirits. The spirits erupt from the ground at a point you choose within range and sweep outward. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 6d10} necrotic damage and becomes {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition frightened}.": "你在面前撒下一些坟墓土，并唤起复仇之灵。这些灵魂从你选择的范围内的地面上喷发并向外扫荡。在以那一点为中心的30英尺半径范围内的每个生物必须进行一次感知豁免。未通过豁免的生物会受到{@damage 6d10}点死灵伤害，并在1分钟内变成{@condition frightened}。通过豁免的生物会受到一半伤害并不会{@condition frightened}。",

Once before the spell ends, an affected creature can complete a {@quickref resting|phb|2|0|long rest} in 4 hours, meditating as an elf does while in trance.

	"You create a psychic binding on the mind of a creature within range. Until this spell ends, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw each time it casts a spell. On a failed save, it takes {@damage 2d6} psychic damage, and it fails to cast the spell. It doesn't expend a spell slot if it fails to cast the spell.": "你在施法范围内对一只生物的思维施加了一种心灵绑定。直到这个法术结束，每当这个生物施放一个法术时，它必须进行一次魅力豁免检定。如果未通过豁免检定，它会受到{@damage 2d6}点心灵伤害，并且无法施放该法术。如果未能施放该法术，它不会消耗法术位。",

	"When you cast this spell, the ammunition flies from your hand with a loud bang, targeting up to five creatures or objects you can see within range. You can launch the bullets at one target or several. Make a ranged spell attack for each bullet. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 3d6} piercing damage. This damage can experience a burst, as described in the gunpowder weapon property (see the Adventuring Gear chapter), but this spell counts as a single effect for the purposes of determining how many times the damage can burst, regardless of the number of targets affected.": "当你施放这个法术时，弹药从你手中飞出，发出巨大的爆炸声，瞄准你能看到范围内的最多五个生物或物体。你可以将子弹发射到一个目标或多个目标。为每颗子弹进行一次远程法术攻击。命中后，目标受到{@damage 3d6}穿刺伤害。这种伤害可以发生爆炸，就像火药武器属性中描述的那样（请参阅冒险装备章节），但是对于决定伤害可以爆炸多少次的目的，这个法术算作单一效果，无论影响的目标数量如何。",
	"Terrifying and nightmarish monsters exist within the unknown void of the in-between. Choose up to six points you can see within range. Voidlike, magical darkness spreads from each point to fill a 10-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners.

	"This spell pushes a creature you touch through a dimensional portal, causing it to disappear and then reappear a short distance away. If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw, it disappears from its current location and reappears 30 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. This travel can take it through walls, creatures, or other solid surfaces, but the target can't reappear inside a solid object or not on solid ground; instead, it reappears in the nearest safe, unoccupied space along the path of travel.": "这个法术将你触摸的生物推送到一个次元传送门中，导致其消失，然后在稍远的地方重新出现。如果目标未能通过一次感知豁免，它将从当前位置消失，并在你选择的方向上离你30英尺处重新出现。这种传送可以穿过墙壁、生物或其他固体表面，但目标不能重新出现在固体物体内部或不在坚实地面上；相反，它会重新出现在沿途行进路径上最近的安全、未占用的空间中。",

If the attacker is a fiend or undead, it takes an extra {@damage 1d8} radiant damage. The creature then must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become {@condition stunned} for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make another Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it is no longer {@condition stunned}.": "在你倒下之前，你可以施放这个法术，对攻击者造成{@damage 1d8}+你从触发攻击中受到的伤害的光辉伤害。如果攻击者是一个恶魔或不死生物，它会额外受到{@damage 1d8}的光辉伤害。然后，目标必须通过一次体质豁免才能免疫{@condition stunned}1分钟。在它的每个回合结束时，目标可以再次进行一次体质豁免。如果成功豁免，它将不再是{@condition stunned}。",

	"You conjure a door to the destination of your choice that lasts for the duration or until dispelled. You sketch the outline of the door with chalk on any hard surface (a wall, a cliffside, the deck of a ship, etc.) and scribe sigils of power around its outline. The doorway must be at least 1 foot wide by 2 feet tall and can be no larger than 5 feet wide by 10 feet tall. Once the door is drawn, place the knob appropriately; it attaches magically to the surface and your drawing becomes a real door to the spell's destination. The doorway remains functional for the spell's duration. During that time, anyone can open or close the door and pass through it in either direction.": "你可以召唤一扇通往你选择目的地的门，持续时间直至被驱散。你可以在任何坚硬表面（墙壁、悬崖、船甲板等）上用粉笔勾勒出门的轮廓，并在轮廓周围刻上能量符号。门的宽度至少为1英尺，高度为2英尺，最大不超过5英尺宽，10英尺高。门绘制完成后，适当地放置门把手；它会魔法地附着在表面上，你的绘画就会变成通往咒语目的地的真实门。门在咒语持续时间内保持有效。在此期间，任何人都可以打开或关闭门，并可以双向通过。",
	"The destination can be on any plane of existence. It must be familiar to you, and your level of familiarity with it determines the accuracy of the spell (determined by the GM). If it's a place you've visited, you can expect 100 percent accuracy. If it's been described to you by someone who was there, you might arrive in the wrong room or even the wrong structure, depending on how detailed their description was. If you've only heard about the destination third-hand, you may end up in a similar structure that's in a very different locale.": "目的地可以位于任何存在平面上。它必须对你来说是熟悉的，你对它的熟悉程度决定了法术的准确性（由GM决定）。如果是你曾经访问过的地方，你可以期待100%的准确性。如果是由曾经去过那里的人描述给你听的，你可能会到达错误的房间，甚至错误的建筑物，这取决于他们描述的详细程度。如果你只是从第三方听说过目的地，你可能会到达一个在非常不同地点的类似建筑物。",
	"{@i Door of the far traveler} doesn't create a doorway at the destination. It connects to an existing, working door. It can't, for example, take you to an open field or a forest with no structures (unless someone built a doorframe with a door in that spot for this specific purpose!). While the spell is in effect, the pre-existing doorway connects only to the area you occupied while casting the spell. If you connected to an existing doorway between a home's parlor and library, for example, and your door leads into the library, then people can still walk through that doorway from the parlor into the library normally. Anyone trying to go the other direction, however, arrives wherever you came from instead of in the parlor.": "{@i Door of the far traveler}在目的地不会创造一个门道。它连接到一个已经存在、正常工作的门。例如，它不能把你带到一个没有建筑物的开阔地或森林中（除非有人在那个地方为了这个特定目的建造了一个门框和门！）。在咒语生效期间，预先存在的门只连接到你施放咒语时所占据的区域。例如，如果你连接到一个家中客厅和图书馆之间的现有门道，而你的门通向图书馆，那么人们仍然可以正常地从客厅通过那个门道进入图书馆。然而，任何试图朝相反方向走的人，会到达你来时的地方，而不是客厅。"
