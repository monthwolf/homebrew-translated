	"Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections. Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.": "发明大师，制造者利用聪明才智和魔法来解锁物体的非凡能力。他们将魔法视为一个等待被解码然后在他们的咒语和发明中加以利用的复杂系统。您可以在接下来的几节中找到您玩这些发明家所需的一切。制造者使用各种工具来引导他们的奥术力量。为了施放一个咒语，一个制造者可能会使用炼金术士工具来制造一种强效的药剂，书法家工具来刻写一个强大的符文，或者修补工具来制作一个临时护符。制造者的魔法与他们的工具和才能紧密相连，很少有其他角色能像制造者一样为工作提供合适的工具。",
	"Throughout the D&D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war. Many lives have been brightened or saved because of the work of kind artificers, but countless lives have also been lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by certain artificers' creations.": "在D&D多元宇宙中，制造者们创造着和平与战争的发明和魔法物品。许多生命因善良制造者的工作而变得明亮或得救，但也有无数生命因某些制造者创造的大规模破坏而丧生。",
	"In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational.": "在被遗忘的国度中，Lantan（兰坦）岛是许多工匠的家园，在龙枪世界中，修补侏儒（tinker gnomes）经常是这个职业的成员。在灰鹰世界的屏障峰（Barrier Peaks）中的奇异技术启发了一些人走上工匠之路，在Mystara中，各个国家雇佣工匠来保持飞艇和其他奇妙装置的运转。",
	"Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries from throughout the multiverse, and from there, the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanning business that hires adventurers to fix problems that others deem unfixable. In Vi's home world, Eberron, magic is harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society, largely as a result of the wondrous ingenuity of artificers.": "在锡基尔城，工匠们分享来自多元宇宙的发现，其中侏儒工匠维(Vi)经营着一家跨宇宙的企业，雇佣冒险者解决其他人认为无法解决的问题。在维的家乡埃伯隆(Eberron)，魔法被当作一种科学来驾驭，并在整个社会中得到应用，这在很大程度上是由于工匠们的奇妙创造力。",
	"To create an artificer, consult the subsections which give you hit points, proficiencies, and starting equipment. Then look at the Artificer table to see which features you get at each level. The descriptions of those features appear below.": "创建一名铸师，参考给出生命值、熟练加值和起始装备的小节。然后查看铸师表格，看看你在每个等级获得哪些特性。这些特性的描述在下面。",
	"Artificers invent cutting-edge problems, then try to solve them-loudly and often with collateral damage.": "制造者们发明尖端问题，然后试图大声解决它们，通常会造成附带损害。",
	"If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, here's what you need to know if you choose artificer as one of your classes.": "如果你的团队在{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中使用了多职业规则，那么如果你选择艺术师作为你的职业之一，这里有一些你需要知道的事情。",
	"As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an artificer.": "作为一个多职业角色，你必须至少有一个智力分数为13才能在这个职业中获得一个等级，或者如果你已经是一名工匠（Artificer），则可以在另一个职业中获得一个等级。",
	"If artificer isn't your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as an artificer: light armor, medium armor, shields, {@item thieves' tools|PHB}, {@item tinker's tools|PHB}.": "如果铸师不是你的初始职业，当你第一级选择铸师时，你将获得以下熟练项：轻甲、中甲、盾牌、{@item thieves' tools|PHB}、{@item tinker's tools|PHB}。",
	"Add half your levels (rounded up) in the artificer class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.": "将你在铁匠 (Artificer) 职业中的等级的一半（向上取整）加到其他职业的等级上，以确定你可用的法术位。",
	"Masters of unlocking magic in everyday objects, artificers are supreme inventors. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled. Artificers use tools to channel arcane power, crafting magical objects.

The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents.": "解锁日常物品中的魔法，制造者(Artificers)是至高的发明家。他们将魔法视为一个等待被解码和控制的复杂系统。制造者使用工具来引导奥术能量，制作魔法物品。要施放一个咒语，一个制造者可以使用{@item alchemist's supplies|PHB}来制造一种强效的药剂，{@item calligrapher's supplies|PHB}在盟友的盔甲上刻印一个强大符文，或者{@item tinker's tools|PHB}制作一个临时护符。制造者的魔法与他们的工具和才能息息相关。",
	"In the world of Eberron, arcane magic has been harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society. Artificers reflect this development. Their knowledge of magical devices, and their ability to infuse mundane items with magic, allows Eberron's most miraculous projects to continue.": "在Eberron的世界中，奥术魔法被当作一种科学形式来利用，并在整个社会中得到应用。制造师(artificers)反映了这一发展。他们对魔法装置的了解，以及他们将平凡物品注入魔法的能力，使得Eberron最神奇的项目能够继续进行。",
	"During the Last War, artificers were marshaled on a massive scale. Many lives were saved because of the inventions of brave artificers, but countless lives were also lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by their creations.": "在最后一场战争中，大规模调动了制造师。许多生命因勇敢的制造师的发明而得以挽救，但也因他们创造的毁灭性武器而丧失了无数生命。",
	"Nothing excites an artificer quite like uncovering a new metal or discovering a source of elemental energy. In artificer circles, new inventions and strange discoveries create the most excitement. Artificers who wish to make their mark must innovate, creating something fresh, rather than iterating on familiar designs.": "没有什么能像发现一种新金属或发现一种元素能源的来源那样激发一个制造者的兴奋。在制造者圈子里，新的发明和奇怪的发现会引起最大的兴奋。想要留下自己的印记的制造者必须要创新，创造出新鲜的东西，而不是在熟悉的设计上做改进。",
	"This drive for novelty pushes artificers to become adventurers. Eberron's main travel routes and populated regions have long since been explored. Thus, artificers seek the frontiers of civilization in hopes of making the next great discovery in arcane research.": "这种对新奇的追求促使制造师成为冒险者。埃伯隆(`Eberron`)的主要旅行路线和人口稠密地区早已被探索过。因此，制造师们寻求文明边缘，希望在奥术研究中取得下一个伟大的发现。",
	"When creating an artificer, think about your character's relationship with the artisan who taught them their craft. Does the character have a rival? Talk to your DM about the role played by artificers in the campaign and the sort of organizations you might have ties to.": "在创建一名铸师时，要考虑你的角色与教导他们手艺的工匠之间的关系。角色是否有竞争对手？与你的DM讨论铸师在冒险中扮演的角色，以及你可能与哪些组织有联系。",
	"Eberron is the world most associated with artificers, yet the class can be found throughout the D&D multiverse. In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the World of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational. In the City of Sigil, artificers share discoveries from throughout the cosmos, and one in particular—the gnome inventor Vi—has run a multiverse-spanning business from there since leaving the world of her birth, Eberron. In the world-city Ravnica, the Izzet League trains numerous artificers, the destructiveness of whom is unparalleled in other worlds—except, perhaps, by the tinker gnomes of Krynn.": "Eberron（艾伯隆）是与工匠最相关的世界，然而这个职业可以在整个D&D多元宇宙中找到。例如，在被遗忘的国度（Forgotten Realms），Lantan（兰坦）岛是许多工匠的家园，在龙枪世界（Dragonlance），修补侏儒经常是这个职业的成员。在灰鹰世界（World of Greyhawk）的屏障山脉中的奇异技术启发了一些人走上工匠之路，在Mystara（密斯塔拉），各个国家雇佣工匠来保持飞艇和其他奇妙装置的运作。在锡基尔之城（City of Sigil），工匠们分享来自整个宇宙的发现，特别是一个——侏儒发明家Vi（维）——自从离开她的出生地艾伯隆以来，就在那里经营着一个跨越多元宇宙的生意。在世界城市拉文尼卡（Ravnica），伊泽特联盟（Izzet League）训练了众多工匠，他们的破坏力在其他世界中是无与伦比的——也许只有克瑞恩（Krynn）的修补侏儒可以与之匹敌。",
	"You can make an artificer quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Intelligence, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the {@background guild artisan} background.": "你可以通过以下建议快速创建一名神器师。首先，将你最高的能力值分配给智力，然后是体质或敏捷。其次，选择{@background guild artisan}背景。",
	"Unlimited": "无限制",
	"A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.": "一个高大的人类部落战士在暴风雪中大步前行，身披毛皮，手持斧头。他大笑着冲向那个胆敢偷猎他人部落麋鹿群的冰霜巨人。",
	"A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.": "一名半兽人对待最新挑战者时咆哮着，准备用她的双手断掉他的脖子，就像她对待前六位对手一样。",
	"Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.": "一名矮人口吐白沫，将头盔猛击在他的黑暗精灵敌人的脸上，然后转身用盔甲护肘猛击另一个敌人的腹部。",
	"These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.": "这些蛮族，尽管各有不同，却被他们的愤怒所定义：无法控制、无法平息、毫无思考的狂怒。他们的愤怒不仅仅是一种情绪，更像是被逼入绝境的猎食者的凶猛、风暴的不懈袭击、海洋的搅动混乱。",
	"For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.": "对于一些人来说，他们的愤怒源自与凶猛动物精神的交流。其他人则从对充满痛苦的世界的愤怒池中汲取力量。对于每一个野蛮人，愤怒不仅是一种激发战斗狂热的力量，还能带来超凡的反射能力、韧性和力量壮举。",
	"People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.": "城镇和城市的人们以自己文明的方式与动物区分开来而感到自豪，仿佛否认自己的本性是一种优越的标志。然而，对野蛮人来说，文明并不是一种美德，而是一种软弱的表现。强者拥抱他们的动物本性——敏锐的直觉、原始的体魄和凶猛的愤怒。当被墙壁和人群围困时，野蛮人会感到不舒服。他们在自己的家园荒野中茁壮成长：苔原、丛林或草原，那里是他们部落生活和狩猎的地方。",
	"Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.": "野蛮人在混乱的战斗中变得更加活跃。他们可以进入狂暴状态，愤怒控制一切，赋予他们超人的力量和韧性。野蛮人只能在休息之前几次发泄这股愤怒，但这几次暴怒通常足以击败任何出现的威胁。",
	"Not every member of the tribes deemed \"barbarians\" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.": "并非每个被文明社会的后裔视为“野蛮人”的部落成员都拥有野蛮人职业。在这些人中，真正的野蛮人就像城镇中技艺高超的战士一样罕见，他们在人民中扮演着保护者和战争时的领袖的角色。世界荒野之地的生活充满了危险：敌对部落、致命的天气和可怕的怪物。野蛮人毫不犹豫地冲向危险，以保护他们的人民。",
	"Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.": "他们在危险面前的勇气使得蛮族人非常适合冒险。对于他们的土著部落来说，流浪常常是一种生活方式，而冒险者漂泊的生活对蛮族人来说并不算什么艰辛。一些蛮族人会怀念部落中紧密的家庭结构，但最终会发现这些被他们与冒险队伍成员之间建立的纽带所取代。",
	"When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?": "在创建一个野蛮人角色时，考虑你的角色来自哪里以及他或她在世界中的位置。与你的DM讨论一个适合你的野蛮人的起源。你是来自遥远的土地，使你成为战役区域的陌生人吗？还是战役设定在一个粗犷的边境地区，野蛮人很常见？",
	"What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to \"civilized\" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.": "是什么促使你选择了冒险生活？是被财富的诱惑吸引到定居之地？你是否与那些土地的士兵联手面对共同的威胁？是怪物或入侵的部落驱使你离开家园，使你成为无根的难民？也许你曾是战俘，被带着镣铐来到“文明”的土地，现在才能赢得自由。或许你因为犯下的罪行、违反的禁忌或被政变罢黜而被人民驱逐出境。",
	"You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the {@background outlander} background.": "您可以通过以下建议快速创建一名野蛮人。首先，将您最高的能力值分配给力量，其次是体质。其次，选择{@background outlander}背景。",
	"I have witnessed the indomitable performance of barbarians on the field of battle, and it makes me wonder what force lies at the heart of their rage.": "我见证了野蛮人在战场上不可征服的表现，让我想知道他们愤怒的核心是什么力量。",
	"The anger felt by a normal person resembles the rage of a barbarian in the same way that a gentle breeze is akin to a furious thunderstorm. The barbarian's driving force comes from a place that transcends mere emotion, making its manifestation all the more terrible. Whether the impetus for the fury comes entirely from within or from forging a link with a spirit animal, a raging barbarian becomes able to perform supernatural feats of strength and endurance. The outburst is temporary, but while it lasts, it takes over body and mind, driving the barbarian on despite peril and injury, until the last enemy falls.": "一个普通人所感受到的愤怒，就像蛮族的暴怒一样，就如同和煦的微风与狂暴的雷暴相似。蛮族的推动力来自于超越纯粹情感的地方，使得其表现更加可怕。无论愤怒的冲动完全源自内心还是与灵兽建立联系，愤怒的蛮族都能够展现出超自然的力量和耐力。爆发是暂时的，但在持续的时候，它会占据身心，驱使蛮族前行，无视危险和伤害，直到最后一个敌人倒下。",
	"It can be tempting to play a barbarian character that is a straightforward application of the classic archetype—a brute, and usually a dimwitted one at that, who rushes in where others fear to tread. But not all the barbarians in the world are cut from that cloth, so you can certainly put your own spin on things. Either way, consider adding some flourishes to make your barbarian stand out from all others; see the following sections for some ideas.": "有时候会很诱人选择一个野蛮人角色，符合经典原型——一个蛮力十足、通常愚蠢的角色，总是冲在别人不敢涉足的地方。但世界上并非所有的野蛮人都是这样，所以你完全可以为角色加入自己的特色。无论如何，考虑添加一些装饰，让你的野蛮人与众不同；请参考以下部分获取一些创意。",
	"Barbarians tend to travel light, carrying little in the way of personal effects or other unnecessary gear. The few possessions they do carry often include small items that have special significance. A personal totem is significant because it has a mystical origin or is tied to an important moment in the character's life—perhaps a remembrance from the barbarian's past or a harbinger of what lies ahead.": "野蛮人倾向于轻装上阵，携带少量个人物品或其他不必要的装备。他们携带的少量物品通常包括一些具有特殊意义的小物件。个人图腾很重要，因为它具有神秘的起源，或者与角色生活中的重要时刻有关——也许是野蛮人过去的回忆，或者是未来的预兆。",
	"A personal totem of this sort might be associated with a barbarian's spirit animal, or might actually be the totem object for the animal, but such a connection is not essential. One who has a bear totem spirit, for instance, could still carry an eagle's feather as a personal totem.": "这种个人图腾可能与野蛮人的灵兽有关，或者实际上可能是该动物的图腾物体，但这种联系并非必要。例如，拥有熊图腾精神的人仍然可以携带鹰羽毛作为个人图腾。",
	"Consider creating one or more personal totems for your character—objects that hold a special link to your character's past or future. Think about how a totem might affect your character's actions.": "考虑为你的角色创建一个或多个个人图腾——这些物品与你角色的过去或未来有特殊联系。想想图腾可能如何影响你角色的行动。",
	"A tuft of fur from a solitary wolf that you befriended during a hunt": "你在狩猎中结识的一只孤狼的一簇毛发(%Wolf%)(%Wolf%)",
	"Three eagle feathers given to you by a wise shaman, who told you they would play a role in determining your fate": "一位智慧的萨满赠予你三根鹰羽，告诉你它们将在决定你命运中扮演重要角色。",
	"A necklace made from the claws of a young cave bear that you slew singlehandedly as a child": "一个项链，由你在年幼时单枪匹马杀死的洞穴熊幼崽的爪制成。",
	"A small leather pouch holding three stones that represent your ancestors": "一个小皮袋，里面装着三块代表你祖先的石头。",
	"A few small bones from the first beast you killed, tied together with colored wool": "你杀死的第一只野兽的几根小骨头，用彩色羊毛系在一起。",
	"An egg-sized stone in the shape of your spirit animal that appeared one day in your belt pouch": "一块鸡蛋大小、呈现出你灵兽形状的石头，突然出现在你的腰包里。",
	"The members of many barbarian clans decorate their bodies with tattoos, each of which represents a significant moment in the life of the bearer or the bearer's ancestors, or which symbolizes a feeling or an attitude. As with personal totems, a barbarian's tattoos might or might not be related to an animal spirit.": "许多蛮族部落的成员会用纹身装饰他们的身体，每一个纹身代表着持有者或持有者祖先生活中的重要时刻，或者象征着一种情感或态度。与个人图腾一样，蛮族的纹身可能与动物灵魂有关，也可能没有。",
	"Each tattoo a barbarian displays contributes to that individual's identity. If your character wears tattoos, what do they look like, and what do they represent?": "每一个野蛮人展示的纹身都是他们个人身份的一部分。如果你的角色有纹身，它们是什么样子的，代表着什么呢？",
	"The wings of an eagle are spread wide across your upper back.": "一只鹰的翅膀展开在你的上背部。",
	"Etched on the backs of your hands are the paws of a cave bear.": "你手背上刻着穴熊的爪印。",
	"The symbols of your clan are displayed in viny patterns along your arms.": "你族群的符号以藤蔓图案展示在你的手臂上。",
	"The antlers of an elk are inked across your back.": "一只麋鹿的鹿角在你的背部延伸。(elk)",
	"Images of your spirit animal are tattooed along your weapon arm and hand.": "你的武器手臂和手上刺有你的灵兽形象。",
	"The eyes of a wolf are marked on your back to help you see and ward off evil spirits.": "狼眼印记在你的背上，帮助你看清并驱散邪灵。",
	"Barbarians vary widely in how they understand life. Some follow gods and look for guidance from those deities in the cycles of nature and the animals they encounter. These barbarians believe that spirits inhabit the plants and animals of the world, and the barbarians look to them for omens and power.": "野蛮人对生活的理解有很大差异。有些追随神祇，寻求这些神祇在自然循环和所遇到的动物中的指引。这些野蛮人相信精神寄居于世界的植物和动物之中，他们寻求这些精神的预兆和力量。",
	"Other barbarians trust only in the blood that runs in their veins and the steel they hold in their hands. They have no use for the invisible world, instead relying on their senses to hunt and survive like the wild beasts they emulate.": "其他蛮族只相信他们血液中流淌的力量和手中握着的钢铁。他们不相信看不见的世界，而是依靠自己的感官像野兽一样狩猎和生存。",
	"Both of these attitudes can give rise to superstitions. These beliefs are often passed down within a family or shared among the members of a clan or a hunting group.": "这两种态度都可能导致迷信。这些信念通常在家庭内代代相传，或在一个家族或狩猎团体的成员之间共享。",
	"If your barbarian character has any superstitions, were they ingrained in you by your family, or are they the result of personal experience?": "如果你的野蛮人角色有任何迷信，它们是由你的家人灌输的，还是由个人经验造成的？",
	"If you disturb the bones of the dead, you inherit all the troubles that plagued them in life.": "如果你扰乱死者的骨骼，你会继承他们生前所受的所有困扰。",
	"Never trust a wizard. They're all devils in disguise, especially the friendly ones.": "永远不要相信一个巫师。他们都是伪装成恶魔的，尤其是那些友好的。(wizard)。",
	"Dwarves have lost their spirits, and are almost like the undead. That's why they live underground.": "矮人们失去了他们的精神，几乎像亡灵一样。这就是为什么他们住在地下。",
	"Magical things bring trouble. Never sleep with a magic object within ten feet of you.": "魔法物品会带来麻烦。永远不要在距离你十英尺以内有魔法物品的情况下入睡。",
	"When you walk through a graveyard, be sure to wear silver, or a ghost might jump into your body.": "当你走过墓地时，一定要穿银制品，否则鬼魂可能会跳入你的身体。",
	"If an elf looks you in the eyes, she's trying to read your thoughts.": "如果一名精灵盯着你的眼睛看，她可能在试图读取你的思绪。",
	"Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts.": "当半精灵穿着粗犷的皮革，在一个被遗忘已久的废墟中用手指轻抚着一座古老的纪念碑时，她哼着歌曲，知识在她的脑海中涌现，被她歌声的魔力召唤出来——关于建造这座纪念碑的人们以及它所描绘的神话传说的知识。",
	"A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.": "一个严肃的人类战士用他的剑有节奏地敲击着他的鳞甲，为他的战歌定下节奏，鼓励他的同伴勇敢和英勇。他歌声中的魔法强化并鼓舞着他们。",
	"Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions' words will be well received.": "当一位侏儒笑着调音她的锄弦琴时，她用微妙的魔法笼罩着聚集的贵族们，确保她的同伴的言辞会被善意接受。",
	"Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.": "无论是学者，诗人，还是恶棍，吟游诗人通过言辞和音乐编织魔法，激励盟友，使敌人士气低落，操纵思维，制造幻象，甚至治愈伤口。",
	"In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.": "在D&D的世界中，言语和音乐不仅仅是空气的振动，而是具有独特力量的发声。吟游诗人是歌曲、演讲和其中蕴含的魔力的大师。吟游诗人说，多元宇宙是通过言语创造出来的，神祇的话语赋予了它形态，这些原始的创世之词的回响仍然在宇宙中回荡。吟游诗人的音乐试图抓住并驾驭这些回响，巧妙地编织进他们的咒语和力量中。",
	"The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.": "吟游诗人最大的优势在于他们的多才多艺。许多吟游诗人更喜欢在战斗中保持中立，利用他们的魔法激励盟友，远距离地干扰敌人。但吟游诗人在必要时也能够在近战中保护自己，利用魔法增强他们的剑和盔甲。他们的法术更倾向于魅惑和幻术，而不是明显破坏性的法术。他们对许多主题有广泛的知识，并且有一种天赋让他们几乎什么都能做得很好。吟游诗人成为他们决心完善的才能的大师，无论是音乐表演还是神秘知识。",
	"True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.": "在世界上，真正的吟游诗人并不常见。并非每位在酒馆歌唱的吟游诗人或在皇家宫廷嬉戏的小丑都是吟游诗人。发现音乐中隐藏的魔法需要艰苦的学习和一定程度的天赋，而大多数吟游诗人和弹唱者都缺乏这种天赋。然而，要区分这些表演者和真正的吟游诗人并不容易。吟游诗人的生活是漫游各地，收集传说，讲故事，并依靠观众的感激生活，就像其他任何艺人一样。但是，知识的深度、音乐技巧的水平和一丝魔法的触碰使吟游诗人与其他同行有所区别。",
	"Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.": "只有极少数吟游诗人会在一个地方长时间停留，他们天生渴望旅行——寻找新的故事，学习新的技能，探索地平线之外的新发现——这使得冒险生涯成为一种自然的召唤。每一次冒险都是学习、练习各种技能、进入被遗忘已久的古墓、发现失落的魔法作品、解读古老的卷轴、前往奇异的地方或遇见异国情调生物的机会。吟游诗人喜欢随同英雄，亲眼见证他们的壮举。一个能够讲述自己亲身经历的令人敬畏故事的吟游诗人会在其他吟游诗人中赢得声誉。事实上，在讲述了那么多关于英雄们完成伟大壮举的故事之后，许多吟游诗人会将这些主题铭记在心，并扮演起英雄角色。",
	"Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character's background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There's no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.": "吟游诗人以故事为生，无论这些故事是真是假。你角色的背景和动机并不像他或她所讲述的故事那样重要。也许你有一个安稳而平凡的童年。关于这一点没有什么好故事可讲，所以你可能会描绘自己是在荒凉沼泽中被一个巫婆抚养长大的孤儿。或者你的童年值得一提。一些吟游诗人通过非凡的方式获得他们的魔法音乐，包括受到仙灵或其他超自然生物的启发。",
	"Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?": "你是否曾在一位大师的指导下进行学徒期，跟随经验丰富的吟游诗人直到你准备好独自闯荡？或者你是在一所学院学习吟游诗人的知识和练习音乐魔法？也许你曾是一个年轻的逃亡者或孤儿，被一位流浪的吟游诗人所结识并成为你的导师。或者你可能是一个被宠坏的贵族孩子，受过一位大师的指导。也许你不小心落入一个巫婆的魔爪，为了获得音乐天赋而与其达成交易，但代价是什么？",
	"You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the {@background entertainer} background.

	"Music is the fruit of the divine tree that vibrates with the Words of Creation. But the question I ask you is, can a bard go to the root of this tree? Can one tap into the source of that power? Ah, then what manner of music they would bring to this world!": "音乐是神圣树的果实，它随着创世之词而振动。但我问你的问题是，一个吟游诗人能否到达这棵树的根部？能否接触到那股力量的源头？啊，那么他们将为这个世界带来怎样的音乐！",
	"Bards bring levity during grave times; they impart wisdom to offset ignorance; and they make the ridiculous seem sublime. Bards are preservers of ancient history, their songs and tales perpetuating the memory of great events down through time—knowledge so important that it is memorized and passed along as oral history, to survive even when no written record remains.": "吟游诗人在严肃时刻带来轻松；他们传授智慧以抵消无知；并使荒谬之事看起来崇高。吟游诗人是古代历史的保护者，他们的歌曲和故事将伟大事件的记忆延续至今——这些知识如此重要，以至于被记住并作为口头历史传承下来，即使没有书面记录，也能延续下去。",
	"It is also the bard's role to chronicle smaller and more contemporary events—the stories of today's heroes, including their feats of valor as well as their less than impressive failures.": "吟游诗人的角色还包括记录更小、更当代的事件——今天英雄们的故事，包括他们的英勇壮举以及不那么令人印象深刻的失败。",
	"Of course, the world has many people who can carry a tune or tell a good story, and there's much more to any adventuring bard than a glib tongue and a melodious voice. Yet what truly sets bards apart from others—and from one another—are the style and substance of their performances.": "当然，世界上有许多人能够唱出动人的旋律或讲述一个精彩的故事，而任何冒险诗人的特质远不止于口若悬河和声音悦耳。然而，真正让诗人与众不同的，以及彼此之间的区别，是他们表演的风格和内容。",
	"To grab and hold the attention of an audience, bards are typically flamboyant and outgoing when they perform. The most famous of them are essentially the D&D world's equivalent of pop stars. If you're playing a bard, consider using one of your favorite musicians as a role model for your character.": "为了吸引观众的注意，吟游诗人通常在表演时表现得张扬和外向。其中最著名的实际上相当于D&D世界的流行明星。如果你在扮演一个吟游诗人，考虑以你最喜欢的音乐家作为你角色的榜样。",

But in order to make any sort of living at your profession, chances are you already have a piece or two in your repertoire that have proven to be audience pleasers.": "如果你的角色刚刚开始，你最终定义性的作品可能在未来。但为了在你的职业中谋生，很有可能你已经有一两部作品在你的作品集中，被证明是受观众喜爱的。",

	"In a bard's quest for the ultimate performance and the highest acclaim, one's instrument is at least as important as one's vocal ability. The instrument's quality of manufacture is a critical factor, of course; the best ones make the best music, and some bards are continually on the lookout for an improvement. Perhaps just as important, though, is the instrument's own entertainment value; those that are bizarrely constructed or made of exotic materials are likely to leave a lasting impression on an audience.": "在一位吟游诗人追求最终表演和最高赞誉的征途中，乐器至少和声音能力一样重要。当然，乐器的制造质量是一个关键因素；最好的乐器制造出最好的音乐，一些吟游诗人不断寻找改进。也许同样重要的是乐器本身的娱乐价值；那些奇异构造或由异国材料制成的乐器很可能会给观众留下深刻印象。",
	"You might have an \"off the rack\" instrument, perhaps because it's all you can afford right now. Or, if your first instrument was gifted to you, it might be of a more elaborate sort. Are you satisfied with the instrument you have, or do you aspire to replace it with something truly distinctive?": "也许你有一把“现成的”乐器，可能是因为现在只能负担得起这样的。或者，如果你的第一把乐器是别人送给你的，那可能是更精致的。你对现有的乐器满意吗，还是渴望用真正独特的东西来替换它？",

	"Almost every bard has suffered at least one bad experience in front of an audience, and chances are you're no exception. No one becomes famous right away, after all; perhaps you had a few small difficulties early in your career, or maybe it took you a while to restore your reputation after one agonizing night when the fates conspired to bring about your theatrical ruin.": "几乎每位吟游诗人都至少经历过一次在观众面前的糟糕经历，你很可能也不例外。毕竟，没有人一下子就变得出名；也许你在职业生涯初期遇到了一些小困难，或者也许你花了一段时间才恢复声誉，那个令人痛苦的夜晚，命运似乎在一起合谋导致你的戏剧性失败。",
	"The ways that a performance can go wrong are as varied as the fish in the sea. No matter what sort of disaster might occur, however, a bard has the courage and the confidence to rebound from it—either pressing on with the show (if possible) or promising to come back tomorrow with a new performance that's guaranteed to please.": "表演出现问题的方式就像海里的鱼一样多样。然而，无论发生什么样的灾难，吟游诗人都有勇气和信心从中恢复——要么继续表演（如果可能的话），要么承诺明天回来，带来一场新的、保证让人满意的表演。",

	"When you sat on your {@item lute|PHB} by mistake during the final stanza of \"Starlight Serenade\"": "当你在“星光小夜曲”最后一节中误坐在你的{@item lute|PHB}上时",
	"Naturally, every bard has a repertoire of songs and stories. Some bards are generalists who can draw from a wide range of topics for each performance, and who take pride in their versatility. Others adopt a more personal approach to their art, driven by their attachment to a muse—a particular concept that inspires much of what those bards do in front of an audience.": "自然地，每位吟游诗人都有一套歌曲和故事。一些吟游诗人是通才，可以从各种主题中汲取灵感进行表演，并以自己的多才多艺为荣。另一些吟游诗人则对自己的艺术采取更加个人化的方式，受到他们对缪斯（Muse）的依恋驱使——这个特定概念激发了这些吟游诗人在观众面前所做的大部分事情。",
	"A bard who follows a muse generally does so to gain a deeper understanding of what that muse represents and how to best convey that understanding to others through performance.": "一个吟游诗人通常会追随一位缪斯，以更深入地理解缪斯所代表的东西，并通过表演将这种理解最好地传达给他人。",

	"You feel a kinship with the natural world, and its beauty and mystery inspire you. For you, a tree is deeply symbolic, its roots delving into the dark unknown to draw forth the power of the earth, while its branches reach toward the sun to nourish their flowers and fruit. Nature is the ancient witness who has seen every kingdom rise and fall, even those whose names have been forgotten and wait to be rediscovered. The gods of nature share their secrets with druids and sages, opening their hearts and minds to new ways of seeing, and as with those individuals, you find that your creativity blossoms while you wander in an open field of waving grass or walk in silent reverence through a grove of ancient oaks.": "你与自然世界有一种亲缘关系，它的美丽和神秘激发了你的灵感。对你来说，树是深具象征意义的，它的根深深地扎根于黑暗的未知之中，汲取大地的力量，而它的枝叶伸向太阳，滋养它们的花朵和果实。大自然是古老的见证者，见证了每一个王国的兴衰，甚至那些名字已经被遗忘并等待重新被发现的王国。自然之神与德鲁伊和圣贤分享他们的秘密，打开他们的心灵和思想，让他们以新的视角看待世界。就像那些个体一样，当你漫步在摇曳的草地上或在古老橡树林中默默敬畏地行走时，你会发现自己的创造力在绽放。",
	"You are on a quest to identify the essence of true love. Though you do not disdain the superficial love of flesh and form, the deeper form of love that can inspire thousands or bring joy to one's every moment is what you are interested in.

You are on the trail of love, that most precious and mysterious of emotions, and your search fills your stories and your songs with vitality and passion.": "你正在追寻真爱的本质。虽然你不鄙视肉体和形式的肤浅爱情，但更深层次的爱可以激发千万人，给每个时刻带来快乐，这才是你感兴趣的。这种爱有许多形式，你可以在任何地方看到它的存在——从美丽宝石的闪光到一个简单渔夫感谢大海恩赐的歌声。你正在追寻爱的踪迹，这是最珍贵、最神秘的情感，你的探寻让你的故事和歌曲充满活力和激情。",
	"Drama embodies conflict, and the best stories have conflict as a key element. From the morning-after tale of a tavern brawl to the saga of an epic battle, from a lover's spat to a rift between powerful dynasties, conflict is what inspires tale-tellers like you to create your best work. Conflict can bring out the best in some people, causing their heroic nature to shine forth and transform the world, but it can cause others to gravitate toward darkness and fall under the sway of evil. You strive to experience or witness all forms of conflict, great and small, so as to study this eternal aspect of life and immortalize it in your words and music.": "戏剧体现冲突，而最好的故事都以冲突作为关键元素。从酒馆斗殴的次日故事到史诗战役的传奇，从恋人争吵到强大王朝之间的裂痕，冲突是激发像你这样的讲故事者创作最佳作品的灵感。冲突可以激发某些人的英雄本性，使其光芒四射，改变世界，但也会导致其他人向黑暗靠拢，沦为邪恶势力的控制下。你努力去体验或目睹各种形式的冲突，无论大小，以便研究这种生命的永恒方面，并将其永恒化在你的文字和音乐中。",

	"Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.": "一个人类举起她的圣物，对着不死生物的力量祈祷诅咒，光芒从中涌出，驱散了围攻她同伴的僵尸。",
	"Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.": "牧师是凡间世界与神灵遥远位面之间的中介。与他们所侍奉的神一样多样化，牧师们努力体现他们神明的杰作。不是普通的祭司，牧师们被赋予了神圣魔法。",
	"Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.": "神圣魔法，顾名思义，是神灵的力量，从他们流向世界。牧师们是这种力量的导管，将其表现为奇迹般的效果。神灵并不将这种力量赐予所有寻求它的人，而只赐予那些被选中来履行崇高使命的人。",
	"Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.": "利用神圣魔法并不依赖于学习或训练。一个（Cleric）可能会学习公式化的祈祷和古老的仪式，但施展（cleric）法术的能力取决于对神灵的奉献和对神祇意愿的直觉感。",
	"Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.": "牧师结合了治疗和鼓舞盟友的有益魔法，以及伤害和阻碍敌人的法术。他们可以引起敬畏和恐惧，施加瘟疫或毒药的诅咒，甚至可以召唤天堂之火来吞噬他们的敌人。对于那些最需要一记钉头疗法的恶棍，牧师依靠他们的战斗训练，让他们带着神的力量冲入近战。",
	"Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.": "并非每位在寺庙或神龛中的侍僧或祭司都是（Cleric）（牧师）。一些神职人员被召唤过着简朴的寺庙服务生活，通过祈祷和献祭来执行他们神明的意志，而不是依靠魔法和武力。在一些城市，神职有时被视为一种政治职位，被看作是通往更高权力职位的跳板，根本不需要与神进行交流。在大多数等级制度中，真正的（Cleric）（牧师）是罕见的。",
	"When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.": "当一名(牧师(Cleric))开始冒险生活时，通常是因为他或她的神要求如此。追求神的目标通常涉及冒险面对文明墙外的危险，打击邪恶或在古墓中寻找圣物。许多(牧师(Cleric))也被期望保护他们神的信徒，这可能意味着与狂暴的兽人战斗，在交战国家之间进行和平谈判，或封印一个允许恶魔王子进入世界的传送门。",
	"Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.": "大多数冒险的（(adventuring)）牧师与他们信仰的建立的寺庙和教派保持一定的联系。一个寺庙可能会请求一位牧师的帮助，或者一位高级祭司可能有权要求这样做。",

	"Once you've chosen a deity, consider your cleric's relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?": "一旦你选择了一位神明，考虑一下你的牧师与那位神的关系。你是自愿进入这项服务的吗？还是神选择了你，不顾你的意愿强迫你服务？你信仰的神庙神职人员如何看待你：是冠军还是惹事生非者？你的最终目标是什么？你的神是否为你设定了特殊任务？还是你在努力证明自己配得上一项伟大的任务？",

	"The question has long been debated: Does a mortal become a cleric as a consequence of deep devotion to one's deity, thereby attracting the god's favor? Or is it the deity who sees the potential in a person and calls that individual into service? Ultimately, perhaps, the answer doesn't matter. However clerics come into being, the world needs clerics as much as clerics and deities need each other.": "这个问题长期以来一直存在争议：一个凡人是否因为对自己的神深深的虔诚而成为一名（cleric）（牧师），从而吸引了神的青睐？还是神看到了一个人的潜力，并召唤那个个体来服侍？最终，也许答案并不重要。无论（clerics）（牧师）是如何产生的，世界都需要（clerics）（牧师），就像（clerics）（牧师）和神灵彼此需要一样。",

	"Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists' activities.": "一名人类化身为豹，蹲伏在高高的树枝上，避开视线，从丛林中窥视着邪恶元素风之神庙的奇特建筑，密切关注着邪教徒的活动。",
	"Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.": "一名半精灵挥舞着一把由纯火形成的刀，冲向一群骷髅士兵，粉碎那不自然的魔法，让这些邪恶生物失去了生命的嘲弄模样。",
	"Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.": "无论是借助自然的元素力量还是模仿动物世界的生物，德鲁伊是自然坚韧、狡猾和愤怒的化身。他们声称并不掌控自然。相反，他们将自己视为自然不可征服意志的延伸。",
	"Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.": "德鲁伊尊崇自然至上，他们获得法术和其他魔法力量，要么来自自然的力量，要么来自自然神。许多德鲁伊追求与自然的超然统一的神秘灵性，而不是对神明的奉献，而另一些为野生自然、动物或元素力量的神明服务。古老的德鲁伊传统有时被称为旧信仰，与在寺庙和神殿中崇拜神明形成对比。",
	"Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.": "德鲁伊法术偏向自然和动物——牙齿和爪子的力量，太阳和月亮的力量，火焰和风暴的力量。德鲁伊还获得了变身为动物的能力，一些德鲁伊对这种实践进行了特别研究，甚至到了更喜欢动物形态胜过自然形态的程度。",
	"For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.": "对于德鲁伊来说，自然存在着一种脆弱的平衡。构成世界的四大元素——空气、土地、火和水——必须保持平衡。如果其中一个元素获得了比其他元素更强大的力量，世界可能会被摧毁，被吸入其中一个元素位面并分解成其组成元素。因此，德鲁伊反对元素邪恶的教派和其他鼓吹某一元素排斥其他元素的人。",
	"Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.": "德鲁伊也关注维系植物和动物生命的微妙生态平衡，以及文明民众与自然和谐共处而非相互对立的需要。德鲁伊接受自然中的残酷，憎恨不自然的事物，包括畸变生物（如眼光兽和思想吞噬者）和不死生物（如僵尸和吸血鬼）。德鲁伊有时会率领突袭行动对抗这些生物，特别是当怪物侵犯德鲁伊的领地时。",
	"Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.": "德鲁伊经常被发现守护神圣遗址或监视未受破坏的自然地区。但当出现重大危险，威胁自然平衡或他们守护的土地时，德鲁伊会扮演更积极的角色，作为冒险者。",
	"When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.": "在创建一个德鲁伊时，考虑你的角色为什么与大自然有如此紧密的联系。也许你的角色生活在一个仍然繁荣的古老信仰社会中，或者在被遗弃在森林深处后被一位德鲁伊抚养长大。也许你的角色与自然之灵有过一次戏剧性的相遇，与一只巨鹰或恐狼面对面，并成功地度过了这次经历。也许你的角色出生在一场史诗般的风暴或火山喷发中，被解释为成为德鲁伊是你角色命运的一部分。",
	"Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.": "作为你作为德鲁伊的使命的一部分，你一直都是一名冒险者吗，还是最初花时间作为（caretaker of a sacred grove or spring）的看护者？也许你的家园被邪恶污染，你选择开始冒险生活，希望找到新的家园或目的地。",
	"You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the {@background hermit} background.": "你可以通过以下建议快速创建一个德鲁伊。首先，智力应该是你最高的能力值，其次是体质。其次，选择{@background hermit}背景。",
	"A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.": "一个德鲁伊认为某些植物是神圣的，特别是赤杨木、白蜡树、桦树、接骨木、榛树、冬青、刺柏、槲寄生、橡树、红豆木、柳树和紫杉。德鲁伊经常将这些植物用作施法焦点的一部分，包括橡木或紫杉的长度或槲寄生的小枝。",
	"Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.": "同样地，(德鲁伊)使用这些木材制作其他物品，比如武器和盾牌。(紫杨)与死亡和重生有关，因此可能会用它来制作弯刀或镰刀的武器把手。(白蜡木)与生命有关，橡木则代表力量。这些木材非常适合制作柄或整个武器，比如棍棒或四分杖，以及盾牌。(欧桦)与空气有关，可能会被用于投掷武器，比如飞镖或标枪。",
	"Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.": "那些来自没有这里描述的植物的地区的德鲁伊已经选择了其他植物来承担类似的用途。例如，沙漠地区的德鲁伊可能会重视丝兰树和仙人掌植物。",
	"Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.": "一些德鲁伊崇拜自然力量本身，但大多数德鲁伊都致力于多元宇宙中崇拜的众多自然神灵之一（附录B中的神祗名单包括许多这样的神灵）。崇拜这些神灵通常被认为是比牧师和城市居民的信仰更古老的传统。事实上，在格雷鹰世界中，德鲁伊信仰被称为古老信仰，它在农民、林地管理员、渔民以及其他与自然密切相处的人群中拥有许多信徒。这一传统包括对自然作为超越拟人化的原始力量的崇拜，同时也包括对贝奥瑞（Oerth Mother）以及奥巴-海（Obad-Hai）、艾露娜（Ehlonna）和乌拉（Ulaa）的信徒的崇拜。",
	"In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.": "在格雷鹰世界（Greyhawk）和被遗忘的国度（Forgotten Realms）中，德鲁伊圈通常不与单一自然神有关。例如，在被遗忘的国度中，任何一个德鲁伊圈可能包括崇拜西尔瓦纳斯（Silvanus）、米埃利基（Mielikki）、埃尔达思（Eldath）、香提亚（Chauntea）甚至严厉的狂怒之神：泰洛斯（Talos）、马拉（Malar）、奥瑞尔（Auril）和安柏莉（Umberlee）的德鲁伊。这些自然神通常被称为第一圈，是德鲁伊中的第一人，大多数德鲁伊都认为他们（甚至是暴力的神）值得崇敬。",
	"The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.": "Eberron（埃伯隆）的德鲁伊信仰与世界上其他宗教，如主权之神（Sovereign Host）、黑暗六（Dark Six）等完全无关。他们相信每一个生物和自然现象——太阳、月亮、风、火以及世界本身——都有灵魂。因此，他们的咒语是一种与这些灵魂沟通和命令的手段。然而，不同的德鲁伊派别对这些灵魂之间以及与文明力量之间的适当关系持有不同的哲学观点。例如，灰焰派（Ashbound）认为奥术魔法是对自然的亵渎，冬之子（Children of Winter）崇拜死亡之力，而守门者（Gatekeepers）保留古老传统，旨在保护世界免受畸变生物的侵袭。",
	"Even in death, each creature plays its part in maintaining the Great Balance. But now an imbalance grows, a force that seeks to hold sway over nature. This is the destructive behavior of the mortal races. The farther away from nature their actions take them, the more corrupting their influence becomes. As druids, we seek mainly to protect and educate, to preserve the Great Balance, but there are times when we must rise up against danger and eradicate it.": "即使在死亡中，每个生物都在维持大平衡中发挥着作用。但现在一个不平衡正在增长，一股力量试图控制自然。这就是凡人种族的破坏行为。他们的行动离自然越远，他们的影响就变得越腐化。作为德鲁伊，我们主要致力于保护和教育，维护大平衡，但有时我们必须起来对抗危险并消灭它。",
	"Druids are the caretakers of the natural world, and it is said that in time a druid becomes the voice of nature, speaking the truth that is too subtle for the general populace to hear. Many who become druids find that they naturally gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered dangerous by the people around them.": "德鲁伊是自然界的守护者，据说随着时间的推移，德鲁伊会成为自然的代言人，说出那些对一般大众来说太微妙以至于无法听到的真相。许多成为德鲁伊的人发现他们自然而然地被自然所吸引；自然的力量、循环和运动充满了他们的思想和灵魂，让他们充满了惊奇和洞察力。许多贤者和智者研究过自然，写下了关于它神秘和力量的篇章，但德鲁伊是一种特殊的存在：在某个时刻，他们开始具象化这些自然力量，产生将他们与自然精神和生命之流联系起来的魔法现象。由于他们奇异而神秘的力量，德鲁伊经常受到周围人的崇敬、避讳或被认为是危险的。",
	"Your druid character might be a true worshiper of nature, one who has always scorned civilization and found solace in the wild. Or your character could be a child of the city who now strives to bring the civilized world into harmony with the wilderness. You can use the sections that follow to flesh out your druid, regardless of how your character came to the profession.": "你的德鲁伊角色可能是真正崇拜自然的信徒，一个一直鄙视文明并在荒野中寻找安慰的人。或者你的角色可能是城市之子，现在努力将文明世界与荒野融为一体。无论你的角色是如何走上这个职业的，你都可以使用接下来的部分来充实你的德鲁伊角色。",
	"Some druids carry one or more items that are sacred to them or have deep personal significance. Such items are not necessarily magical, but every one is an object whose meaning connects the druid's mind and heart to a profound concept or spiritual outlook.": "一些德鲁伊携带着对他们来说是神圣的或具有深刻个人意义的物品。这些物品不一定是魔法的，但每一个都是一个物品，其意义将德鲁伊的心灵和心灵连接到一个深刻的概念或精神观念。",
	"When you decide what your character's treasured item is, think about giving it an origin story: how did you come by the item, and why is it important to you?": "当你决定你的角色的珍贵物品时，考虑给它一个起源故事：你是如何得到这件物品的，它为什么对你如此重要？",

	"Many druids feel a strong link to a specific aspect of the natural world, such as a body of water, an animal, a type of tree, or some other sort of plant. You identify with your chosen aspect; by its behavior or its very nature, it sets an example that you seek to emulate.": "许多德鲁伊与自然界的特定方面建立了强烈联系，比如水体、动物、某种类型的树木，或者其他植物。你与所选择的方面产生共鸣；通过它的行为或本质，它为你树立了一个你希望效仿的榜样。",
	"Yew trees remind you of renewing your mind and spirit, letting the old die and the new spring forth.": "(紫杉)树让你想起更新你的思想和精神，让旧事物消逝，新事物涌现。",

	"It's not unusual for would-be druids to seek out (or be sought out by) instructors or elders who teach them the basics of their magical arts. Most druids who learn from a mentor begin their training at a young age, and the mentor has a vital role in shaping a student's attitudes and beliefs.": "对于准德鲁伊来说，寻找（或被寻找）教导他们魔法艺术基础的导师或长者并不罕见。大多数从导师那里学习的德鲁伊都是在年幼时开始接受训练，导师在塑造学生的态度和信念方面起着至关重要的作用。",

	"Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic.

	"Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind.

	"As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you?

	"Of all the adventurers in the worlds of D&D, the fighter is perhaps the greatest paradox.

On the other hand, regardless of the tools and methods one uses, at the heart of every fighter's motivation lies the same basic truth: it is better to wound than to be wounded.": "在D&D的世界中，冒险者中战士也许是最大的悖论。一方面，这个职业的一个显著特点是没有两个战士以完全相同的方式从事自己的工作；他们的武器、盔甲和战术在一个广泛的范围内各不相同。另一方面，无论使用什么工具和方法，每个战士动机的核心都是相同的基本真理：伤害别人总比被伤害要好。",
	"Although some adventuring fighters risk their lives fighting for glory or treasure, others are primarily concerned with the welfare of others.

If that's not the case, consider devising a heraldic sign that symbolizes an aspect of your nature or speaks to what you see as your purpose in the world.": "你的角色可能隶属于一个组织或事业，因此可能已经在某种程度上以某种旗帜旅行。如果不是这种情况，请考虑设计一个纹章标志，象征着你的某种本质或表达你认为自己在世界上的目的。",

	"Some fighters are natural-born combatants who have a talent for surviving in battle. Others learned the basics of their combat prowess in their formative years from spending time in a military or some other martial organization, when they were taught by the leaders of the group.": "一些战士是天生的战斗者，他们有在战斗中生存的天赋。其他人则在他们的成长年代从军队或其他武术组织中学习了他们战斗技能的基础，当时他们是由该组织的领导者教导的。",
	"A third type of fighter comes from the ranks of those who received one-on-one instruction from an accomplished veteran of the craft. That instructor was, or perhaps still is, well versed in a certain aspect of combat that relates to the student's background.": "第三种战士来自那些接受过来自该行业资深老手的一对一指导的人。那位导师对与学生背景相关的某种战斗方面非常精通，也许至今仍然如此。",
	"If you decide that your character had an individual instructor, what is that person's specialty? Do you emulate your instructor in how you fight, or did you take the instructor's teachings and adapt them to your own purposes?": "如果你决定让你的角色有一个个人导师，那个人的专长是什么？你在战斗中是模仿你的导师，还是将导师的教导改编成适合自己的目的？",
	"Gladiator. Your instructor was a slave who fought for freedom in the arena, or one who willingly chose the gladiator's life to earn money and fame.": "角斗士。你的教练是一个在竞技场为自由而战的奴隶，或者是一个自愿选择角斗士生活来赚取金钱和名誉的人。",

	"Many fighters distinguish themselves from their peers by adopting and perfecting a particular style or method of waging combat. Although this style might be a natural outgrowth of a fighter's personality, that's not always the case—someone's approach to the world in general does not necessarily dictate how that person operates when lives are on the line.": "许多战士通过采用和完善特定的战斗风格或方法来使自己脱颖而出。尽管这种风格可能是战士个性的自然延伸，但并非总是如此——一个人对世界的看法并不一定决定他在生死关头时的行动方式。",

	"Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.": "无论是什么门派，僧侣们都能够魔法般地驾驭身体内流动的能量。无论是将其转化为令人瞩目的战斗技巧，还是作为防御能力和速度的微妙聚焦，这种能量贯穿于僧侣所做的一切。",
	"Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.": "僧侣们认真研究一种被大多数修行传统称为气（ki）的魔法能量。这种能量是弥漫整个多元宇宙的魔法元素之一，具体来说，是流经活体的元素。僧侣们利用这种力量在自己身上创造魔法效果，超越自身的身体能力，其中一些特殊攻击可以阻碍对手气的流动。利用这种能量，僧侣将超凡的速度和力量注入他们的徒手攻击中。随着经验的积累，他们的武术训练和对气的掌握使他们能够更好地控制自己的身体和敌人的身体。",
	"Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn't be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.": "在D&D的世界中，小型有围墙的回廊点缀着各地的风景，是普通生活中的小避难所，时间仿佛停滞了。居住在那里的僧侣通过沉思和严格的训练追求个人完美。许多人在儿童时期进入修道院，当他们的父母去世、找不到食物来养活他们时，或者为了回报僧侣为他们的家人所做的善行而被送去那里。",

Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.": "有些僧侣完全与周围的人群隔绝，远离任何可能阻碍他们精神进步的事物。另一些则宣誓孤立，只在领袖、贵族赞助人或其他凡人或神圣力量的命令下才会出现，担任间谍或刺客的角色。",

As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.": "大多数（%num%）僧侣不会躲避他们的邻居，经常前往附近的城镇或村庄，用他们的服务交换食物和其他物品。作为多才多艺的战士，僧侣经常会保护他们的邻居免受怪物或暴君的侵害。",
	"For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.": "对于一名僧侣来说，成为冒险者意味着离开有结构的、共同生活的方式，成为一名流浪者。这可能是一个艰难的转变，僧侣们并不轻易地承担这一责任。那些离开他们的修道院的人认真对待自己的工作，将冒险视为对他们身体和精神成长的个人考验。一般来说，僧侣们对物质财富不太在意，他们被一种追求完成比仅仅杀死怪物和掠夺宝藏更伟大使命的愿望所驱使。",
	"As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?": "在创建你的武僧角色时，思考一下你与学习技能并度过成长岁月的修道院的联系。你是孤儿还是被遗弃在修道院门口的孩子？是你的父母因为僧侣们为他们提供的服务而将你承诺给修道院？是因为犯下了罪行而选择隐居生活？还是你自己选择了出家修行的生活？",
	"Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?": "考虑一下你为什么离开。是因为你的修道院院长选择你执行一个特别重要的任务而离开了闭关吗？也许是因为违反了社区规定而被驱逐。你离开时是害怕还是高兴？你希望在修道院外完成什么事情？你渴望回到家吗？",
	"As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.": "由于修道院社区的有序生活和驾驭气的纪律要求，武僧们几乎总是（(monks)）在法治方面。",
	"You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the {@background hermit} background.": "您可以通过以下建议快速创建一名武僧。首先，将敏捷作为您最高的能力值，其次是智慧。其次，选择{@background hermit}背景。",
	"Do not mistake my silence for acceptance of your villainy. While you blustered and threatened, I've planned four different ways to snap your neck with my bare hands.": "不要把我的沉默误解为对你邪恶行径的接受。当你咆哮和威胁时，我已经计划了四种不同的方式用我的双手扭断你的脖子。",
	"Monks walk a path of contradiction. They study their art as a wizard does, and like a wizard, they wear no armor and typically eschew weapons. Yet they are deadly combatants, their abilities on a par with those of a raging barbarian or a superbly trained fighter. Monks embrace this seeming contradiction, for it speaks to the core of all monastic study. By coming to know oneself completely, one learns much of the wider world.": "僧侣走一条矛盾的道路。他们像巫师一样研究自己的艺术，像巫师一样，他们不穿盔甲，通常避开武器。然而，他们是致命的战士，他们的能力与愤怒的野蛮人或训练有素的战士不相上下。僧侣接受这种看似矛盾，因为它触及了所有修行的核心。通过完全了解自己，一个人可以更多地了解更广阔的世界。",
	"A monk's focus on inner mastery leads many such individuals to become detached from society, more concerned with their personal experience than with happenings elsewhere. Adventuring monks are a rare breed of an already rare type of character, taking their quest for perfection beyond the walls of the monastery into the world at large.": "一位僧侣对内在修行的专注使许多这样的个体变得与社会脱节，更关注他们的个人体验而不是其他地方发生的事情。冒险的僧侣是一种已经稀有的角色中的一种罕见品种，他们将对完美的追求超越了僧院的墙壁，延伸到整个世界。",
	"Playing a monk character offers many intriguing opportunities to try something different. To distinguish your monk character even further, consider the options in the sections that follow.": "扮演一名武僧角色提供了许多有趣的机会，可以尝试一些不同的东西。要进一步区分您的武僧角色，考虑以下部分中的选项。",
	"A monk studies in a monastery in preparation for a life of asceticism. Most of those who enter a monastery make it their home for the rest of their lives, with the exception of adventurers and others who have reason to leave. For those individuals, a monastery might serve as a refuge between excursions to the world or as a source of support in times of need.": "一位僧侣在修道院里学习，为苦行生活做准备。大多数进入修道院的人会把它当作终身的家园，除了那些冒险家和其他有理由离开的人。对于这些个体来说，修道院可能会在他们外出探险之间充当庇护所，或者在需要时提供支持。",

	"Even in the monastic lifestyle, which eschews materialism and personal possessions, symbolism plays an important part in defining the identity of an order. Some monastic orders treat certain creatures with special regard, either because the creature is tied to the order's history or because it serves as an example of a quality the monks seek to emulate.": "即使在避免物质主义和个人财产的修道生活中，象征主义也在定义一个修会的身份中起着重要作用。一些修道会对某些生物给予特殊尊重，要么是因为这种生物与修会的历史有关，要么是因为它作为修士们希望效仿的品质的一个例子。",
	"If your character's monastery had a special icon, you might wear a crude image of the creature somewhere inconspicuous on your clothing to serve as an identifying mark. Or perhaps your order's icon does not have a physical form but is expressed through a gesture or a posture that you adopt, and which other monks might know how to interpret.": "如果你的角色的修道院有一个特殊的图标，你可能会在衣服的某个不显眼的地方佩戴一个粗糙的生物形象，作为一个识别标志。或者你所属的教派图标没有实体形式，而是通过一个手势或姿势来表达，其他僧侣可能知道如何解读。",
	"Monkey. Quick reflexes and the ability to travel through the treetops are two of the reasons why your order admires the monkey.": "猴子。快速反应和能够在树梢间穿行的能力是你们的种族钦佩猴子的两个原因。",
	"Dragon Turtle. The monks of your seaside monastery venerate the dragon turtle, reciting ancient prayers and offering garlands of flowers to honor this living spirit of the sea.": "龙龟。你所在海边寺庙的僧侣们崇拜着龙龟，诵读着古老的祈祷文，献上花环来尊崇这位海之活灵。",

	"Dragon. A dragon once laired within your monastery. Its influence remains long after its departure.": "龙。一条龙曾经在你的修道院内有巢穴。即使它离开后，它的影响仍然存在。",
	"During your studies, you were likely under the tutelage of a master who imparted to you the precepts of the order. Your master was the one most responsible for shaping your understanding of the martial arts and your attitude toward the world. What sort of person was your master, and how did your relationship with your master affect you?": "在你的学习过程中，你很可能是在一位导师的指导下学习，他向你传授了该派别的教义。你的导师是最负责塑造你对武术的理解和对世界态度的人。你的导师是怎样的人，你与导师的关系又是如何影响了你呢？",

Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.": "身披闪耀在阳光下的板甲，尽管长途跋涉中沾满了尘土，一个人类放下她的剑和盾，双手放在一个濒临死亡的男人身上。神圣的光芒从她的手中散发出来，男人的伤口愈合，他惊讶地睁开双眼。",
	"A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.": "一名矮人蹲在一块岩石后面，他的黑斗篷让他在夜晚几乎看不见，看着一支兽人战队庆祝他们最近的胜利。悄无声息地，他潜入他们当中，低声发誓，两只兽人甚至还没意识到他的存在就已经死了。",

	"Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.": "无论他们的起源和使命如何，圣骑士们都因他们的誓言而团结起来，站在对抗邪恶势力的前线。无论是在神的祭坛前和牧师的见证之下宣誓，还是在一片神圣的林地中，面对自然精灵和仙灵，又或者在绝望和悲伤之际，只有死者作为见证，圣骑士的誓言都是一种强大的羁绊。这是一种力量的源泉，将虔诚的战士转变为受祝福的冠军。",
	"A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.": "一个圣骑士发誓要维护正义和公正，支持世界上的善良事物抵御逼近的黑暗，并在邪恶势力潜伏的地方追捕他们。不同的圣骑士会专注于正义事业的各个方面，但他们都受到赋予力量以履行神圣使命的誓言所约束。尽管许多圣骑士都致力于善良之神，但圣骑士的力量一样来自对正义本身的承诺，而不仅仅是来自某位神祇。",
	"Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.": "圣骑士们经过多年的训练，学习战斗技能，精通各种武器和盔甲。即便如此，他们的武技仍然次于他们所掌握的魔法力量：治愈病弱和受伤者的力量，惩戒邪恶和不死生物的力量，以及保护无辜者和那些与他们一起为正义而战的人的力量。",
	"Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.": "几乎可以说，圣骑士的生活本质上就是冒险的生活。除非受到持久的伤害使他或她暂时远离冒险，否则每个圣骑士都生活在对抗邪恶的宇宙斗争的最前线。战士在世界的民兵和军队中已经很罕见了，但能够宣称自己是真正的圣骑士的人更是少之又少。当他们接到召唤时，这些战士会放下以往的职业，拿起武器与邪恶作战。有时他们的誓言会让他们成为精英骑士团的领袖，但即使如此，他们的忠诚也首先是为了正义事业，而不是为了王冠和国家。",
	"Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.": "冒险的圣武士们认真对待他们的工作。对古代废墟或尘封的地穴进行探险可能是为了比获取财宝更高尚的目的。邪恶潜伏在地牢和原始森林中，即使是对抗它的最小胜利也能使宇宙平衡偏离湮灭的边缘。",
	"The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don't appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.": "圣武士角色最重要的方面是他或她神圣使命的性质。虽然与你的誓言相关的职业特性直到你达到3级时才会出现，但通过阅读职业末尾的誓言描述来提前计划选择。你是一个忠诚于正义和荣誉之神的善良仆人，一个身披闪亮铠甲、前去击败邪恶的圣洁骑士吗？你是光明的光荣勇士，珍视一切美好事物，与阴影对立的骑士，其誓言源自许多神祇之前的传统吗？还是你是一个心怀怨恨的孤独者，发誓要向那些行过大恶的人复仇，是神明派遣的死亡天使或被复仇之火驱使的人？附录B列出了多元宇宙中许多受圣武士崇拜的神明，如托姆(Torm)、提尔(Tyr)、海罗尼厄斯(Heironeous)、帕拉丁(Paladine)、基瑞-乔利斯(Kiri-Jolith)、多尔·阿拉(Dol Arrah)、银焰(Silver Flame)、巴哈穆特(Bahamut)、雅典娜(Athena)、雷-霍拉赫蒂(Re-Horakhty)和海姆达尔(Heimdall)。",
	"How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.": "你是如何体验到成为一名圣骑士的呼召的？你是否在祈祷时听到了来自无形神灵或天使的低语？是另一位圣骑士感知到了你内在的潜力，并决定培训你成为一名侍从？还是一些可怕的事件——比如你家园的毁灭——驱使你踏上了征程？也许你偶然发现了一片神圣的树林或隐藏的精灵聚居地，感到自己被召唤去保护所有这样的善良和美丽的避难所。或者你可能从最早的记忆中就知道成为圣骑士是你的使命，几乎就像你被派遣到这个世界上，灵魂上刻着这个目的一样。",
	"As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.": "作为对抗邪恶力量的守护者，圣骑士们很少有邪恶的取向。他们中的大多数人走在慈善和正义的道路上。考虑你的取向如何影响你追求神圣使命的方式，以及你在神祇和凡人面前的行为方式。你的誓言和取向可能是和谐的，或者你的誓言可能代表着你尚未达到的行为标准。",
	"You can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the {@background noble} background.": "您可以通过以下建议快速创建一名圣骑士。首先，力量应该是您最高的能力值，其次是魅力。其次，选择{@background noble}背景。",
	"The true worth of a paladin is measured not in foes defeated or dungeons plundered. It is measured in lives saved and hearts turned to the causes of mercy and justice.": "一个圣骑士的真正价值不在于击败的敌人或掠夺的地牢，而在于挽救的生命和转向怜悯与正义事业的心。",
	"A paladin is a living embodiment of an oath—a promise or a vow made manifest in the person of a holy warrior who has the skill and the determination to see the cause through to the end. Some paladins devote themselves expressly to protecting the innocent and spreading justice in the world, while others resolve to attain that goal by conquering those who stand defiant and bringing them under the rule of law.": "圣骑士是誓言的活生生体现——一个圣洁战士的人格中体现了一个承诺或誓言，他们有技能和决心将事业进行到底。一些圣骑士专注于保护无辜者并在世界传播正义，而另一些则决心通过征服那些挑衅者并将他们置于法律统治之下来实现这一目标。",
	"Although no paladin in the world could be described as typical, a number of them are narrow-minded do-gooders who refuse to tolerate even the smallest deviation from their own outlook. Paladins who take up the adventuring life, however, rarely remain so rigid in their attitudes—if only to keep from alienating their companions.": "虽然世界上没有典型的圣骑士，但其中一些是心胸狭窄的好人，甚至对于最小的偏差都不容忍。然而，选择冒险生活的圣骑士很少会保持如此僵化的态度——如果只是为了不疏远他们的同伴。",
	"You can flesh out your paladin character by using the suggestions below. It's important to keep in mind that most paladins aren't robots.

	"The precepts of a paladin's oath provide purpose to the character and dictate an ultimate goal or an overall intent that the paladin abides by and advances. Aside from that, some paladins are driven by a personal goal that either complements or transcends the dictates of their oaths. Paladins who swear different oaths might have the same personal goal, differing only in how they apply that goal to their actions when upholding their oaths.": "圣骑士誓言的戒律为角色提供了目的，并规定了圣骑士遵守和推进的最终目标或总体意图。除此之外，一些圣骑士受个人目标驱使，这些目标可能是与誓言相辅相成或超越誓言的规定。发誓不同誓言的圣骑士可能拥有相同的个人目标，只是在履行誓言时如何将这一目标应用到他们的行动中有所不同。",

Your symbol exemplifies the oath you have taken and communicates that message to those around you, friend and foe alike.": "圣骑士们注意到符号的影响，并且许多人会采用或设计一种带有独特形象的艺术装置。你的符号体现了你所宣誓的誓约，并向周围的人传达这个信息，无论是朋友还是敌人。",

	"Your paladin character might have an enemy that dates from the days before you took up your path.

	"Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.": "荒野战士，游侠专门猎杀威胁文明边缘的怪物——人形掠夺者、狂暴野兽和怪物、可怕的巨人以及致命的龙。他们学会像捕食者一样追踪猎物，悄无声息地穿行于荒野之间，并将自己隐藏在灌木丛和瓦砾中。游侠将他们的战斗训练重点放在那些对付特定偏爱敌人特别有用的技巧上。",
	"Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.": "由于对荒野的熟悉，游侠们获得了施展法术的能力，这些法术利用了自然的力量，就像德鲁伊一样。他们的法术和战斗能力一样，强调速度、隐秘和狩猎。游侠的才能和能力在保护边境的严峻任务中得到了致命的专注。",
	"Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.": "尽管游侠可能以猎人、向导或追踪者的身份谋生，但游侠真正的使命是保卫文明边缘，抵御从荒野中侵袭而来的怪物和人类兽群的破坏。在一些地方，游侠们会聚集在秘密组织中，或者与德鲁伊团体联手。然而，许多游侠都独立行动，甚至有些过于独立，他们知道，当一条龙或一群兽人发动攻击时，游侠可能是第一道——也可能是最后一道——防线。",
	"This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.": "这种强烈的独立性使得游侠非常适合冒险，因为他们习惯了远离舒适的干燥床铺和热水浴的生活。面对那些在野外抱怨困难的城市出生的冒险者，游侠们会以一种混合了娱乐、沮丧和同情的方式回应。但他们很快就会意识到，其他能在与文明敌人的战斗中自力更生的冒险者是值得额外负担的。被宠坏的城市人也许不知道如何在野外自给自足或找到清水，但他们在其他方面弥补了这一点。",
	"As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.": "在创建你的游侠角色时，考虑赋予你特殊能力的训练性质。你是跟随一位导师训练，一起在荒野中漫游直到掌握了游侠的方式吗？你是离开了你的学徒身份，还是你的导师被杀害了——也许是被成为你宿敌的怪物所杀？或者你是作为与德鲁伊团结的一群游侠之一学习技能的，接受了神秘路径和荒野知识的训练。你可能是自学成才的，一个隐士通过在荒野中生存的必要性学会了战斗技能、追踪，甚至与自然建立了魔法联系。",
	"What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?": "你对某种特定敌人的仇恨源自何处？是有怪物杀死了你所爱的人或摧毁了你的家乡吗？还是你目睹了这些怪物造成的破坏太多，决心遏制它们的掠夺行为？你的冒险生涯是在保护边境的工作中延续，还是有了重大变化？是什么促使你加入一群冒险者？你是否觉得教导新盟友野外生存的方式具有挑战性，还是欢迎他们带来的摆脱孤独的解脱？",
	"You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the {@background outlander} background.": "您可以通过以下建议快速创建一个游侠。首先，将敏捷作为您最高的能力值，其次是感知。 （一些专注于双武器战斗的游侠可能会将力量值高于敏捷。）其次，选择{@background outlander}背景。",

	"Rangers are free-minded wanderers and seekers who patrol the edges of civilized territory, turning back the denizens of the wild lands beyond. It is a thankless job, since their efforts are rarely understood and almost never rewarded. Yet rangers persist in their duties, never doubting that their work makes the world a safer place.": "游侠是自由心灵的漫游者和探索者，他们巡逻在文明领土的边缘，将野蛮之地的居民驱逐回去。这是一项无人感激的工作，因为他们的努力很少被理解，几乎从不被奖励。然而，游侠们坚守自己的职责，从不怀疑自己的工作让世界变得更安全。",
	"A relationship with civilization informs every ranger's personality and history. Some rangers see themselves as enforcers of the law and bringers of justice on civilization's frontier, answering to no sovereign power. Others are survivalists who eschew civilization altogether. They vanquish monsters to keep themselves safe while they live in and travel through the perilous wild areas of the world. If their efforts also benefit the kingdoms and other civilized realms that they avoid, so be it.": "每位游侠的个性和历史都受文明关系的影响。一些游侠视自己为法律执行者和文明边疆的正义使者，不受任何主权势力约束。另一些是野外生存专家，完全避开文明社会。他们消灭怪物以保护自己，在世界危险的荒野地区生活和旅行。如果他们的努力也使他们避开的王国和其他文明领域受益，那就更好。",
	"If you're creating or playing a ranger character, the following sections offer ideas for embellishing the character and enhancing your roleplaying experience.": "如果你正在创建或扮演一个游侠角色，以下部分提供了一些想法来丰富角色并增强你的角色扮演体验。",
	"A ranger's view of the world begins (and sometimes ends) with that character's outlook toward civilized folk and the places they occupy. Some rangers have an attitude toward civilization that's deeply rooted in disdain, while others pity the people they have sworn to protect—though on the battlefield, it's impossible to tell the difference between one ranger and another. Indeed, to those who have seen them operate and been the beneficiaries of their prowess, it scarcely matters why rangers do what they do. That said, no two rangers are likely to express their opinions on any matter in the same way.": "一个游侠对世界的看法始于（有时也终于）该角色对文明人和他们占据的地方的态度。一些游侠对文明社会持有根深蒂固的鄙视态度，而另一些则怜悯他们誓死守护的人们——然而在战场上，很难区分一个游侠和另一个。事实上，对于那些见过他们行动并受益于他们技艺的人来说，游侠为何而行几乎无关紧要。尽管如此，没有两个游侠可能会以相同的方式表达他们对任何事情的看法。",
	"If you haven't yet thought about the details of your character's worldview, consider putting a finer point on things by summarizing that viewpoint in a short statement (such as the entries on the following table).

	"All rangers, regardless of how they came to take up the profession, have a strong connection to the natural world and its various terrains. For some rangers, the wilderness is where they grew up, either as a result of being born there or moving there at a young age. For other rangers, civilization was originally home, but the wilderness became a second homeland.": "所有游侠，无论是如何开始从事这个职业的，都与自然界及其各种地形有着强烈的联系。对于一些游侠来说，荒野是他们成长的地方，要么是因为在那里出生，要么是在年幼时搬到那里。对于其他游侠来说，文明原本是他们的家园，但荒野成为了第二故乡。",

With skills tied to stealth, subterfuge, and trickery, rogues can get into and out of trouble in ways that few other characters can emulate.": "当蛮力无法完成任务，或者魔法不可用或不合适时，盗贼就会崭露头角。凭借与潜行、诡计和欺骗相关的技能，盗贼可以以其他角色难以模仿的方式解决麻烦。",
	"Some rogues who turn to adventuring are former criminals who have decided that dodging monsters is preferable to remaining one step ahead of the law. Others are professional killers in search of a profitable application of their talents between contracts. Some simply love the thrill of overcoming any challenge that stands in their way.": "一些转向冒险的流氓是以前的罪犯，他们决定躲避怪物比继续逃避法律更可取。另一些是职业杀手，在合同之间寻找能够利用他们天赋的有利机会。还有一些人只是热爱战胜任何阻碍他们的挑战的刺激。",
	"On adventures, a rogue is likely to mix an outwardly cautious approach—few rogues enjoy combat—with a ravenous hunger for loot. Most of the time, in a rogue's mind, taking up arms against a creature is not about killing the creature but about becoming the new owner of its treasure.": "在冒险中，(rogue)盗贼往往会采取外表谨慎的方式——很少有盗贼喜欢战斗——但却有着对战利品的贪婪渴望。在盗贼的心目中，大多数时候，与生物交战并不是为了杀死它，而是为了成为其宝藏的新主人。",

	"Most of what rogues do revolves around obtaining treasure and preventing others from doing the same. Little gets in the way of attaining those goals, except that many rogues are enticed away from that path by a compulsion that clouds their thinking—an irresistible need that must be satisfied, even if doing so is risky.": "大多数(%)盗贼(rogues)所做的事情都围绕着获取财宝和阻止他人做同样的事情。在实现这些目标方面几乎没有什么阻碍，除了许多(%)盗贼(rogues)被一种执念所诱使，这种执念会混淆他们的思维——一种无法抗拒的需求，必须被满足，即使这样做是冒险的。",
	"A rogue's guilty pleasure could be the acquisition of a physical item, something to be experienced, or a way of conducting oneself at certain times. One rogue might not be able to pass up any loot made of silver, for instance, even if said loot is hanging around the neck of a castle guard. Another one can't go through a day in the city without lifting a purse or two, just to keep in practice.": "一个(``rogue``)的罪恶快感可能是获得一个物品，某种体验，或者在某些时候的行为方式。一个(``rogue``)可能无法抵挡银制战利品，即使这些战利品挂在城堡卫兵的脖子上也不例外。另一个(``rogue``)在城市里过一天都无法不偷几个钱包，只是为了保持技能。",

	"Naturally, those who enforce the law are bound to come up against those who break it, and it's the rare rogue who isn't featured on at least one wanted poster. Beyond that, it's in the nature of their profession that rogues often come into contact with criminal elements, whether out of choice or necessity. Some of those people can be adversaries too, and they're likely to be harder to deal with than the average member of the city watch.": "自然而然，执法者注定会遇到那些违法者，而至少会有一张通缉海报上会出现罕见的流氓。除此之外，流氓经常会与犯罪分子接触，无论是出于选择还是必要。其中一些人也可能是对手，他们可能比城市警卫队的普通成员更难对付。",

	"Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.": "术士们携带着一种神秘血统、异世界影响或未知宇宙力量赋予的魔法天赋。一个人无法像学习语言那样学习巫术，就像一个人无法学会过传奇生活一样。没有人选择巫术；力量选择了术士。",
	"Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped.

Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.": "魔法是每位术士的一部分，充盈着身体、心灵和精神，潜藏着等待被开发的力量。一些术士操控源自古老龙族魔法注入的血脉。其他人体内携带着一股未经控制的原始魔法，如同一场混乱的风暴，以意想不到的方式显现。",
	"The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.": "术士能力的出现是极其不可预测的。一些龙族血脉在每一代中都会产生一个术士，但在其他血统中，每个个体都可能是术士。大多数时候，术士的天赋似乎是偶然发生的。有些术士无法说出他们的力量来源，而其他人将其追溯到自己生活中的奇怪事件。与恶魔的接触，干妖在婴儿出生时的祝福，或者尝试神秘泉水的滋味可能会激发术士的天赋。同样，魔法神的赐予，暴露于内位面的元素力量或疯狂混乱的混沌位面，或者对现实内部运作的一瞥也可能如此。",
	"Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.": "术士对于巫师依赖的咒语书和古老的魔法典籍没有用处，也不像术士那样依赖于赋予法术的主人。通过学习如何驾驭和引导自身天生的魔法，他们可以发现新的、惊人的释放力量的方法。",
	"Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on.": "在这个世界上，术士很罕见，而且很少能找到一个不以某种方式参与冒险生活的术士是不寻常的。那些体内充满魔力的人很快就会发现，这股力量不喜欢保持安静。术士的魔法渴望被驾驭，如果不加以召唤，它往往会以不可预测的方式溢出。",
	"Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.": "术士经常有晦涩或古怪的动机驱使他们踏上冒险之旅。有些人寻求对贯穿他们的魔法力量有更深入的理解，或者寻找其起源之谜的答案。其他人希望找到一种摆脱它的方法，或者释放其全部潜力。无论他们的目标是什么，术士在冒险队伍中和巫师一样有用，尽管他们的魔法知识相对较少，但在使用他们所知道的法术方面具有巨大的灵活性。",
	"The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?": "创建你的术士时需要考虑的最重要问题是你的力量来源。作为一个起始角色，你将选择一个与龙族血脉或野性魔法影响相关的起源，但你的力量确切来源由你决定。它是家族的诅咒，从遥远的祖先传承给你的吗？还是一些非凡事件让你被赋予内在魔法，但也许也留下了伤痕？",
	"How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you've been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.": "你对身体中涌动的魔法力量有什么感觉？你是接受它、试图掌控它，还是沉浸在它不可预测的本质中？这是一种祝福还是诅咒？你是主动寻求它的，还是它找到了你？你有拒绝它的选择吗？如果可以，你希望拒绝吗？你打算如何运用这种力量？也许你觉得自己被赋予这种力量是为了某种崇高的目的。或者你可能认为这种力量赋予了你做任何想做的事情的权利，从那些缺乏这种力量的人那里拿走你想要的东西。也许你的力量将你与世界中的某个强大个体联系在一起——那个在你出生时祝福你的仙灵生物，将一滴自己的血液滴入你的血脉的龙，将你创造为实验品的巫妖，或者选择你携带这种力量的神灵。",
	"You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the {@spell light}, {@spell prestidigitation}, {@spell ray of frost}, and {@spell shocking grasp} cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells {@spell shield} and {@spell magic missile}.": "您可以通过以下建议快速创建一个巫师。首先，魅力应该是您最高的能力值，其次是体质。其次，选择隐士背景。第三，选择{@spell light}、{@spell prestidigitation}、{@spell ray of frost}和{@spell shocking grasp}这些零级法术，以及1级法术{@spell shield}和{@spell magic missile}。",
	"Practice and study are for amateurs. True power is a birthright.": "练习和学习是给业余者的。真正的力量是与生俱来的。",
	"When it comes to drawing forth their abilities in times of need, sorcerers have it easy compared to other characters. Their power not only rests within them, but it likely takes some effort to keep it at bay. Every sorcerer is born to the role, or stumbles into it through cosmic chance. Unlike other characters, who must actively learn, embrace, and pursue their talents, sorcerers have their power thrust upon them.": "当需要发挥他们的能力时，与其他角色相比，术士很容易做到。他们的力量不仅存在于他们之中，而且很可能需要一些努力来控制它。每个术士生来就担负着这个角色，或者是通过宇宙的机缘巧合陷入其中。与其他角色不同，其他角色必须积极学习、拥抱和追求他们的天赋，术士的力量是被强加给他们的。",
	"Because the idea of an innately magical being traveling among them does not sit well with many folk, sorcerers tend to breed mistrust and suspicion in others they come across. Nonetheless, many sorcerers succeed in overcoming that prejudice through deeds that benefit their less magically gifted contemporaries.": "由于天生具有魔法能力的存在在人们中间旅行的想法让许多人感到不安，因此术士往往会在与他人交往时引起不信任和怀疑。尽管如此，许多术士通过行为来造福于那些魔法天赋较低的同代人，成功地克服了这种偏见。",
	"Sorcerers are often defined by the events surrounding the manifestation of their power. For those who receive it as an expected birthright, its appearance is a cause for celebration. Other sorcerers are treated as outcasts, banished from their homes after the sudden, terrifying arrival of their abilities.": "术士通常是由其力量显现时的事件所定义的。对于那些将其视为理所当然的天赋的人来说，它的出现是值得庆祝的。其他术士则被视为弃儿，在他们的能力突然而可怕地到来后被驱逐出家园。",
	"Playing a sorcerer character can be as rewarding as it is challenging. The sections below offer suggestions on how to flesh out and personalize your persona.": "扮演一个术士角色既有挑战性，也有回报。以下部分提供了关于如何丰富和个性化你的人物的建议。",
	"Some sorcerers understand where their power came from, based on how their abilities manifested. Others can only speculate, since their powers came to them in a way that suggests no particular cause.": "一些巫师根据他们的能力是如何显现出来的来理解他们的力量来源。其他人只能推测，因为他们的力量似乎是毫无特定原因地降临到他们身上的。",
	"Does your character know the source of your magical power? Does it tie back to some distant relative, a cosmic event, or blind chance? If your sorcerer doesn't know where their power arose from, your DM can use this table (or select an origin) and reveal it to you when the information plays a role in the campaign.": "你的角色是否知道你的魔法力量的来源？它是否与某个遥远的亲戚、宇宙事件或盲目的机遇有关？如果你的术士不知道他们的力量来自何处，你的DM可以使用这个表格（或选择一个起源），并在信息在战役中起作用时向你揭示。",

Even so, many sorcerers have a subtle but telling physical trait that sets them apart from other folk.": "一个休息的术士几乎和普通人无法区分；只有当他们的魔法释放时，术士们才会展现出他们真正的本性。即便如此，许多术士都有一个微妙但显著的身体特征，使他们与其他人区分开来。",
	"If your sorcerer has a supernatural mark, it might be one that's easily concealed, or it could be a source of pride that you keep on constant display.": "如果你的术士有一个超自然印记，它可能是一个容易隐藏的标记，或者它可能是一个你时刻展示的骄傲之源。",

	"As the world well knows, some sorcerers are better than others at controlling their spellcasting. Sometimes a wild display of magic gone awry emanates from a sorcerer who casts a spell. But even when one's magic goes off as planned, the act of casting is often accompanied by a telltale sign that makes it clear where that magical energy came from.": "众所周知，一些术士比其他人更擅长控制他们的咒语施放。有时候，一个术士施放咒语时会出现魔法失控的狂野表现。但即使魔法按计划进行，施法的行为通常也伴随着一个显著的迹象，清楚地表明那股魔法能量来自何处。",

	"A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.": "术士是通过与另一个世界的存在达成契约而定义的。有时，术士与其保护者之间的关系类似于牧师与神明之间的关系，尽管担任术士保护者的存在并非神灵。 术士可能会领导一个致力于恶魔王子、大执政官或完全陌生实体的教派——这些实体通常不会受到牧师的侍奉。 然而，更常见的安排类似于师傅和学徒之间的关系。 术士通过为保护者提供偶尔的服务来学习和增长力量。",
	"The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.": "对于术士赋予的魔法范围从对术士本身的轻微但持久的改变（比如能力在黑暗中看清或阅读任何语言）到强大法术的获取。与书呆子般的巫师不同，术士在魔法之外还擅长一些近身战斗。他们喜欢穿轻甲并懂得如何使用简单武器。",
	"Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.": "术士们被一种无法满足的对知识和力量的渴望驱使着，这驱使他们与他们的契约联系在一起，并塑造了他们的生活。这种渴望驱使着术士们与他们的契约联系在一起，并塑造了他们以后的职业生涯。",
	"Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.": "许多结合自己与邪恶生物的术士的故事广为人知。但许多术士侍奉的对象并非邪恶生物。有时候，一个在荒野中旅行的人会来到一座奇异美丽的塔楼，遇见它的精灵领主或夫人，并在不完全意识到的情况下陷入契约之中。有时候，当一个疯狂但卓越的学生在研究禁忌知识的书籍时，他的思维被打开，超越了物质世界，接触到了存在于外部虚空中的异族生物。",
	"Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.": "一旦缔结契约，术士对知识和力量的渴望就无法仅通过学习和研究来满足。如果没有打算利用所获得的力量，没有人会与如此强大的保护者缔结契约。事实上，绝大多数术士都在积极追求他们的目标，通常意味着某种冒险。此外，他们的保护者的要求也驱使术士走向冒险。",
	"As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?": "在制作你的术士角色时，花些时间思考一下你的守护者以及契约对你施加的义务。是什么导致你与守护者签订契约，你是如何与守护者取得联系的？是被引诱召唤恶魔，还是主动寻找仪式与外星老神取得联系？是你寻找你的守护者，还是你的守护者找到并选择了你？你是否厌倦了契约的义务，还是在期待承诺给予你的奖赏时愉快地服侍？",
	"Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character's adventuring career. Your patron's demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.": "与你的DM合作，确定你的契约将在你角色的冒险生涯中扮演多大的角色。你的赞助者的要求可能会驱使你踏上冒险之旅，或者完全由你在冒险之间可以做的小事情组成。",
	"What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron's plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?": "你和你的(保护者)有什么样的关系？是友好的、对抗性的、紧张的，还是浪漫的？你的(保护者)认为你有多重要？你在(保护者)的计划中扮演什么角色？你是否认识其他侍奉你的(保护者)的仆人？",
	"How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron's voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds—messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.": "你的（(patron)）是如何与你沟通的？如果你有一个使者，它可能偶尔会用你（(patron)）的声音说话。一些术士发现他们的（(patron)）的信息刻在树上，夹杂在茶叶中，或者漂浮在云端——这些信息只有术士能看到。其他术士在梦中或清醒的幻象中与他们的（(patron)）交谈，或者只与中间人打交道。",
	"You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the {@background charlatan} background.

	"Warlocks are finders and keepers of secrets. They push at the edge of our understanding of the world, always seeking to expand their expertise. Where sages or wizards might heed a clear sign of danger and end their research, a warlock plunges ahead, heedless of the cost. Thus, it takes a peculiar mixture of intelligence, curiosity, and recklessness to produce a warlock. Many folk would describe that combination as evidence of madness. Warlocks see it as a demonstration of bravery.": "术士是秘密的发现者和守护者。他们挑战着我们对世界的理解边界，始终努力扩展自己的专业知识。智者或巫师可能会注意到危险的明显迹象并结束他们的研究，而术士则会冲在前面，不顾一切后果。因此，要成为一名术士，需要一种特殊的智慧、好奇心和鲁莽。许多人会将这种组合描述为疯狂的证据。而术士则将其视为勇气的体现。",
	"Warlocks are defined by two elements that work in concert to forge their path into this class. The first element is the event or circumstances that led to a warlock's entering into a pact with a planar entity. The second one is the nature of the entity a warlock is bound to. Unlike clerics, who typically embrace a deity and that god's ethos, a warlock might have no love for a patron, or vice versa.": "术士的定义取决于两个元素，它们共同铸造了他们进入这个职业的道路。第一个元素是导致术士与一个位面实体签订契约的事件或情况。第二个元素是术士所约束的实体的本质。与通常会拥抱神明及其伦理观的牧师不同，术士可能对其赞助者没有感情，反之亦然。",
	"The sections that follow provide ways to embellish a warlock character that could generate some intriguing story and roleplaying opportunities.": "接下来的部分提供了一些方法来装饰一个能够产生一些有趣故事和角色扮演机会的术士角色。",
	"Every relationship is a two-way street, but in the case of warlocks and their patrons it's not necessarily true that both sides of the street are the same width or made of the same stuff. The feeling that a warlock holds for their patron, whether positive or negative, might be reciprocated by the patron, or the two participants in the pact might view one another with opposing emotions.": "每段关系都是双向的，但在术士和他们的守护者之间，不一定两边的街道宽度相同或由相同的材料构成。术士对他们的守护者怀有的感情，无论是积极的还是消极的，可能会得到守护者的回应，或者契约中的两方可能以相反的情绪看待彼此。",
	"When you determine the attitude your warlock character holds toward your patron, also consider how things look from the patron's perspective. How does your patron behave toward you? Is your patron a friend and ally, or an enemy that grants you power only because you forced a pact upon it?": "当你确定你的术士角色对待你的(守护者)的态度时，也要考虑从(守护者)的角度看事情。你的(守护者)对你是怎么行为的？你的(守护者)是朋友和盟友，还是一个只因为你强迫它订立契约才给予你力量的敌人？",

	"Your patron tricked you into a pact and treats you as a slave.": "你的保护者欺骗你签订契约，并将你视为奴隶。",
	"You are mostly left to your own devices with no interference from your patron. Sometimes you dread the demands it will make when it does appear.": "在大多数时候，你基本上可以自行决定，没有来自你的守护者的干涉。有时候，你会担心它出现时会提出什么要求。",
	"A pact can range from a loose agreement to a formal contract with lengthy, detailed clauses and lists of requirements. The terms of a pact—what a warlock must do to receive a patron's favor—are always dictated by the patron. On occasion, those terms include a special proviso that might seem odd or whimsical, but warlocks take these dictates as seriously as they do the other requirements of their pacts.": "一个契约可以从松散的协议到具有冗长详细条款和要求清单的正式合同。一个契约的条款——即术士必须做些什么才能获得赞助者的青睐——总是由赞助者规定。偶尔，这些条款可能包括一个看似奇怪或异想天开的特别条款，但术士们会像对待其他契约要求一样认真对待这些规定。",
	"Does your character have a pact that requires you to change your behavior in an unusual or seemingly frivolous way? Even if your patron hasn't imposed such a duty on you already, that's not to say it couldn't still happen.": "你的角色是否有一个需要你以一种不寻常或看似轻率的方式改变行为的契约？即使你的守护者还没有对你施加这样的义务，也不能排除这种可能性。",

	"When you use an eldritch invocation, you must speak your patron's name aloud or risk incurring its displeasure.": "当你使用一项邪能召唤时，你必须大声说出你的守护者的名字，否则可能招致它的不满。",
	"Some patrons make a habit of, and often enjoy, marking the warlocks under their sway in some fashion. A binding mark makes it clear—to those who know about such things—that the individual in question is bound to the patron's service. A warlock might take advantage of such a mark, claiming it as proof of one's pact, or might want to keep it under wraps (if possible) to avoid the difficulties it might bring.": "一些顾客有一个习惯，并经常喜欢以某种方式标记他们控制的术士。一个束缚印记清楚地表明——对于那些了解这类事情的人来说——被标记的个体被绑定到顾客的服务中。一个术士可能会利用这样的标记，将其视为契约的证明，或者可能希望将其保密（如果可能的话）以避免可能带来的困难。",
	"If your warlock's pact comes with a binding mark, how you feel about displaying it probably depends on the nature of your relationship with the one who gave it to you. Is the mark a source of pride or something you are secretly ashamed of?": "如果你的术士契约带有一个束缚印记，你对展示它的感受可能取决于你与给予你这个印记的那个人的关系性质。这个印记是一种自豪的来源，还是你暗自感到羞耻的东西？",

	"Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.": "身着银色长袍，标志着她的身份，一位精灵闭上双眼，屏蔽战场上的干扰，开始默念咒语。手指在她面前编织，她完成了咒语，向敌军阵地发射一颗微小的火焰珠，它爆发成一片大火，吞噬了士兵们。",
	"Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.": "一个人类抄写员在光秃秃的石地板上用粉笔绘制一个复杂的魔法阵，一遍又一遍地检查自己的工作，然后沿着每条线和优美的曲线撒上铁粉。当阵法完成时，他吟诵着一段漫长的咒语。空间在阵法内打开，带来了来自超自然位面的硫磺气息。",
	"Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.": "在地牢交叉路口趴着的一只侏儒，把一把刻有神秘符号的小骨头扔出去，边念着一些咒语。他闭上眼睛，为了更清晰地看到幻象，缓缓点头，然后睁开眼睛，指向他左边的通道。",
	"Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.": "巫师是至高无上的魔法使用者，通过施放的咒语来定义和团结为一个职业。巫师利用弥漫于宇宙的微妙魔法纹理，施放出爆炸性火焰、弧形闪电、微妙欺骗和蛮力精神控制的咒语。他们的魔法能召唤来自其他存在平面的怪物，窥视未来，或将被杀敌人变成僵尸。他们最强大的咒语可以将一种物质变成另一种，召唤流星陨落，或打开通往其他世界的传送门。",
	"Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.": "野性而神秘，形态和功能多样，魔法的力量吸引着那些渴望掌握其奥秘的学生。有些人渴望成为像（神）那样的存在，能够塑造现实本身。虽然施放典型法术只需要念出几句奇怪的话语、飞快的手势，有时还需要一撮或一把异域材料，但这些表面的组成部分几乎无法揭示在数年的学徒期和无数小时的学习之后所获得的专业知识。",
	"Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.": "巫师的生死取决于他们的法术。其他一切都是次要的。随着实验和经验的增长，他们学习新的法术。他们也可以从其他巫师、古老的典籍或铭文，以及深谙魔法的古代生物（如仙灵）那里学习法术。",
	"Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.": "巫师的生活很少平凡。巫师最接近平凡生活的可能是在图书馆或大学担任智者或讲师，教授他人多元宇宙的秘密。其他巫师可能会以占卜者的身份出售他们的服务，加入军队，或追求犯罪或统治的生活。",
	"But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.": "但是，即使是最不爱冒险的巫师，也会被知识和力量的诱惑所吸引，使他们走出自己的图书馆和实验室，进入颓废的废墟和失落的城市。大多数巫师相信，古代文明中的同行知道了一些魔法的秘密，这些秘密已经随着时间的流逝而失传，发现这些秘密可能会打开通往比当前时代任何魔法都更强大的力量之路。",
	"Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic?

	"The price that wizards pay for their mastery is that most valuable of commodities: time. It takes years of study, instruction, and experimentation to learn how to harness magical energy and carry spells around in one's own mind. For adventuring wizards and other spellcasters who aspire to the highest echelons of the profession, the studying never ends, nor does the quest for knowledge and power.": "术士为掌握魔法而付出的代价是最宝贵的商品之一：时间。学习、指导和实验需要数年时间，才能学会如何驾驭魔法能量，并将咒语储存在自己的头脑中。对于冒险的术士和其他渴望达到职业最高层的咒术师来说，学习永无止境，追求知识和力量的旅程也永不停歇。",

	"Node magic is a powerful class of spellcasting that draws power from naturally occurring pools of magical energy that collect deep beneath the earth's surface. It is a form of magic that requires intense concentration and magical prowess to unlock, but offers exceptional boons to the caster's power. Those who can use this form of magic seek to find earth nodes, collection points where this power gathers. These nodes can increase the power of spells and other magical effects in their area, and while those that know they have found an earth node guard the discovery jealously, many nodes remain undiscovered or unnoticed by the creatures that live near them.": "节点魔法是一种强大的咒语施放类别，它从地表深处自然形成的魔法能量池中汲取力量。这是一种需要极度专注和魔法技巧才能解锁的魔法形式，但为施法者的力量提供了异常的恩惠。那些能够使用这种魔法的人寻找地球节点，这些是力量聚集的收集点。这些节点可以增加其区域内咒语和其他魔法效果的力量，而那些知道自己找到了地球节点的人会嫉妒地保护这一发现，许多节点仍然未被发现或被生活在附近的生物忽视。",
	"The boundaries of an earth node are not visible to the naked eye, but they can be detected. Any creature that comes within 30 feet of the outermost layer of an earth node may make a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check, revealing the source and direction of a concentration of nodal power on a successful check. Nodes can exist in any place, and are not limited in their reach or location by solid stone, minerals, open space, or any other form of terrain. Some nodes are in open passageways, while others are entrenched in solid stone. In some cases, the power of these nodes extends far enough upwards that it reaches the surface.": "地之结界对于肉眼是看不见的，但是它们可以被探测到。任何靠近地之结界最外层的生物，可以进行一次 DC 15 的智力检定，成功的话就能揭示结界能量的来源和方向。地之结界可以存在于任何地方，不受固体石头、矿物、开阔空间或其他地形的限制。有些结界位于开放通道中，而另一些则深藏在坚固的石头中。在某些情况下，这些结界的力量延伸得足够高，以至于达到地表。",
	"An earth node's strength is typically defined on a class scale from 1 to 5, with class five earth nodes being the most powerful. The more powerful an earth node, the less common it is. About half of the nodes in existence are class 1 nodes, about a fourth are class 2, and almost all that remain fall into classes 3 and 4. Finding a class 5 node is so rare that such a discovery often heralds great changes for the discoverers, and often a bitter struggle to maintain control as various factions fight over the powerful node. Entire cities or cultures are often built around powerful nodes. A node with a high class rating is actually a series of nodal shells with strength increasing by 1 class for each layer further in, with the innermost shell having the highest node rating. For instance, a class 3 node is actually a class 1 node, surrounding a class 2 node, which surrounds a class 3 node at the center. Often, the size of a node is an indication of its class, though this isn't always the case.": "一个地球结点的强度通常在一个从1到5的等级尺度上定义，其中5级地球结点是最强大的。地球结点越强大，它就越不常见。存在的结点中大约一半是1级结点，四分之一左右是2级结点，剩下的几乎都属于3级和4级。发现一个5级结点是如此罕见，以至于这样的发现通常预示着发现者们将会面临巨大的变革，通常会引发各方势力为了控制这个强大结点而进行激烈的斗争。整个城市或文化往往会围绕强大的结点建立起来。一个等级评分高的结点实际上是一系列结点壳，每一层向内进一步，强度增加1个等级，最内层的结点壳具有最高的结点评分。例如，一个3级结点实际上是一个1级结点，环绕着一个2级结点，再环绕着一个中心的3级结点。通常，结点的大小是其等级的指示，尽管这并不总是情况。",
	"Earth nodes may be used by spellcasters as they attempt to augment their powers. Those who are more familiar with earth nodes may have some advantages when using these nodes, as determined by the DM.": "术士在尝试增强他们的力量时可以使用地球节点。那些对地球节点更熟悉的人在使用这些节点时可能会有一些优势，由DM决定。",
	"If you cast a spell of 1st level or higher while within the area of a node, you can make a skill check using your spellcasting modifier against a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level + the node's class value. If you are proficient with the {@skill Arcana} skill, you can make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check instead of using your spellcasting modifier. On a successful check, you can choose to enhance the spell in one of the following ways:": "如果你在结点区域内施放1级或更高级别的法术，你可以使用你的法术修正值进行技能检定，检定 DC 为 10 + 法术等级 + 结点的等级值。如果你精通{@skill Arcana}技能，你可以进行一个智力({@skill Arcana})检定，而不是使用你的法术修正值。若检定成功，你可以选择以下一种方式增强法术：",

	"You can increase the damage of the spell by a number of damage dice used by the spell equal to the node value.": "你可以通过增加与节点值相等的伤害骰数量来增加法术的伤害。",
	"Earth nodes not only contain vast stores of magical energy, but also resonate with particular schools of magic. Over time, certain spells may become stored in nodes, and can be accessed by capable spellcasters.": "地球结点不仅包含着丰富的魔法能量，还与特定的魔法学派共振。随着时间的推移，某些法术可能会被储存在结点中，并可以被有能力的法师所访问。",
	"If you have the Spellcasting of Pact Magic feature, and finish a long rest within the area of a node, you can attempt to draw some of the magic of the node into yourself by making a skill check using your spellcasting modifier against a DC equal to 15 + the node's class value. If you are proficient with the {@skill Arcana} skill, you can make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check instead of using your spellcasting modifier. On a successful check, you gain the ability to cast one spell determined by the DM once, without expending a spell slot or requiring any material components, before you complete your next long rest.": "如果你拥有契约魔法（Pact Magic）特性，并在结界节点（node）的范围内完成一次长休，你可以尝试通过使用你的施法修正值进行技能检定，检定 DC 为 15 加上节点的等级值，将节点的部分魔法吸收到自己身上。如果你精通{@skill Arcana}技能，你可以进行一次智力（{@skill Arcana}）检定，而不是使用你的施法修正值。在成功检定后，你可以在完成下一次长休之前，无需消耗法术位或任何材料成分，施放一次由DM决定的法术。",
	"To determine the spell you receive, the DM can choose any spell up to two levels higher than the class of the node you rested near, or the spell can be determined randomly by first assigning the node an affinity to a particular school of magic (see the Node Affinity table below) and then rolling on the Node Spells table associated with the school of magic that matches the node's affinity. When rolling on the Node Spells table, the DM adds the value of the node's class as a bonus to the roll.": "为确定你获得的法术，DM可以选择比你休息附近节点的职业高两级的任何法术，或者法术可以通过首先为节点分配一个特定魔法学派的亲和力（见下面的节点亲和力表）然后在与节点亲和力匹配的魔法学派的节点法术表上进行随机确定。在节点法术表上进行投掷时，DM将节点的职业值作为奖励加到投掷中。",
	"Portals are an exceptionally common means of travel within, out of, and into the Underdark. Many caravans of experienced Underdark citizens use portals as a means of avoiding treacherous areas, or to bypass obstacles. That said, portals are not always safe. Many portals lead to strange and dangerous planes of existence before connecting to others that lead to its travelers' intended destination. The reason for these detours is known only to the long-passed creators of the portals. Major portals are often marked, but lesser-known portals also exist, often adorned with nothing but cryptic graffiti that provides small clues about the portal's destination and the inhabitants on the other side.": "传送门是地下城（Underdark）内部、外部和之间旅行的一种异常常见的方式。许多经验丰富的地下城居民的商队使用传送门来避开危险区域，或者绕过障碍物。尽管如此，传送门并不总是安全的。许多传送门会先通往奇怪而危险的存在平面，然后再连接到其他通往旅行者目的地的传送门。这些绕道的原因只有传送门的创造者已逝的人才知道。主要传送门通常会被标记，但也存在一些鲜为人知的传送门，通常只装饰着神秘的涂鸦，提供有关传送门目的地和另一侧居民的一些线索。",
	"Hundreds of archmages, high priests, secret circles, monstrous races, and dark cabals have had a hand in creating the multitude of hidden doorways riddling Faerûn. Magic of this sort is unusually durable, and often survives for centuries-or millennia - after its creators have vanished into history or lost any use for their handiwork. Accordingly the workings of portals are often mysterious and unpredictable.": "数百位大法师、高阶祭司、秘密组织、怪物种族和黑暗团体参与创造了遍布法罗的众多隐藏门。这种魔法异常耐久，通常能在创造者消失在历史长河中或对他们的作品失去兴趣后存活数个世纪，甚至千年。因此，传送门的运作常常神秘而不可预测。",
	"Most portals share some common features and qualities.": "大多数传送门都共享一些共同的特点和特质。",
	"The many cultures and races of the Underdark have learned to use portals to fulfill their needs. The few lightloving inhabitants of the Underdark craft or live near portals that open to sunny climes on the surface, allowing the sunlight itself to filter through the portal, while protecting the inhabitants from the heat that often accompanies it. Arid areas often have access to a portal to the elemental plane of water, serving as an oasis in the underground desert. Whatever the case, portals very rarely go unnoticed for long, so a portal typically means civilization is somewhere nearby.": "地下世界的许多文化和种族已经学会利用传送门来满足他们的需求。地下世界中少数喜爱光明的居民会制造或居住在通往地表阳光明媚地方的传送门附近，让阳光本身透过传送门，同时保护居民免受通常伴随阳光的炎热。干旱地区通常可以接触到通往水元素位面的传送门，成为地下沙漠中的绿洲。无论情况如何，传送门很少会长时间不被注意到，因此传送门通常意味着文明就在附近。",
	"An archway or frame of some kind usually marks a portal's location, so it can be found when needed and so that creatures don't blunder into it accidentally. A {@spell detect magic} spell can reveal a portal's magical aura. If a detected portal is currently functioning (ready to transport creatures), it has a strong aura. If a detected portal is not currently able to transport creatures (usually because it has a limited number of uses, which are currently expended), it has a weak aura. Strong or weak, a portal radiates transmutation magic.": "通常，一个拱门或框架标志着传送门的位置，这样可以在需要时找到它，以免生物意外地闯入。一项{@spell detect magic}法术可以揭示传送门的魔法光环。如果被探测到的传送门目前正在运作（可以传送生物），它会有强烈的光环。如果被探测到的传送门目前无法传送生物（通常是因为它有限的使用次数已经耗尽），它会有一个弱光环。无论是强光环还是弱光环，传送门都会辐射变化魔法。",
	"Once created, a portal can't be moved.": "一旦创建，传送门就无法移动。",
	"Portal builders often restrict access to their creations by setting conditions for their use. Special conditions for triggering a portal can be based on the possession of a portal key, a specific attribute (race, alignment, etc.) of the creature attempting to use the portal, casting a spell that targets the portal, or other conditions (such as the time of day) that the DM determines.": "传送门建造者通常通过设置条件来限制他们创造物的使用。触发传送门的特殊条件可能基于拥有传送门钥匙、试图使用传送门的生物的特定属性（种族，属性等）、施放以传送门为目标的法术，或其他条件（如时间）由DM确定。",
	"When a portal is activated, it remains open for 1 round. Any creature can pass through the portal during that round.": "当一个传送门被激活时，它会持续开启1轮。在那一轮内，任何生物都可以穿过传送门。",
	"Portals can be either unidirectional, bidirectional, or multidirectional.": "传送门可以是单向的，双向的，或者多向的。",
	"A unidirectional portal has a single entrance point and a single exit point. The portal can only be entered through the entrance point. After a creature exits the portal, the exit point vanishes until the next time a creature passes through the portal from the entrance point.": "一个单向传送门只有一个入口和一个出口。传送门只能通过入口进入。当生物从传送门出口离开后，出口会消失直到下一次有生物从入口通过传送门。",
	"A bidirectional portal is like a door. A creature can enter or exit from either end of the portal's destinations.": "一个双向传送门就像一扇门。生物可以从传送门的目的地的任一端进入或退出。",
	"A multi-directional portal is similar to a bidirectional portal, in that when a creature passes through the portal, they exit from a portal that itself can be entered. However, the destination when passing back through the portal will be different than where the creature originally came from. For example, if a creature enters portal A and exits at portal B, portal B will not take the creature back to portal A, like a bidirectional portal, but instead takes the creature to portal C. It is also possible for one of the portals in a multidirectional portal chain to loop back to the first portal or to terminate in a unidirectional": "一个多方向传送门类似于双向传送门，当生物穿过传送门时，他们会从一个可以再次进入的传送门中出来。然而，当生物再次穿过传送门时，目的地会与生物最初来自的地方不同。例如，如果一个生物进入传送门A并从传送门B出来，传送门B不会将生物带回传送门A，而是将生物带到传送门C。在多方向传送门链中，也有可能有一个传送门回到第一个传送门，或者终止于一个单向传送门。",
	"Creatures who touch or pass through the area of the portal are instantly teleported to the location the portal's builder has specified. It is not possible to poke one's head through a portal to see what's on the other side. A portal can only transport creatures that can fit through the portal's physical dimensions.": "当生物接触或穿过传送门区域时，它们会立即被传送到传送门建造者指定的位置。无法将头伸入传送门来查看另一侧的情况。传送门只能传送能够通过其物理尺寸的生物。",
	"If a solid object blocks the destination, the portal does not function. A creature that is standing in the space of a portal's exit is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature's choice when another creature comes through the portal.": "如果一个实体物体挡住了目的地，传送门将无法使用。当另一个生物通过传送门时，站在传送门出口空间的生物会被推到该生物选择的最近的未占用空间。",
	"A portal can't be destroyed by physical means or by spell effects that destroy objects (such as a {@spell disintegrate} spell). A successful {@spell dispel magic} spell (DC 20) causes a portal to become non-functional for 1 minute. The spell {@spell gate seal|JBoE}* locks a portal and prevents its operation.": "传送门无法被物理手段或破坏物体的法术效果（如{@spell disintegrate}法术）摧毁。成功的{@spell dispel magic}法术（DC 20）会使传送门在1分钟内失效。法术{@spell gate seal|JBoE}*可以锁定传送门并阻止其运作。",
	"While newly created portals function exceptionally well, centuries of decay and neglect can lead to portal seepage, the process by which a portal slowly loses some of its magical energy and begins to malfunction. Seepage is typically noticeable as features of the two sides of the portal start to appear at the other end. A portal based in a jungle that leads to a dwarven citadel may be situated on solid, carved stone, while on the other side, ferns adorn the ground inside the fortress. Other effects may occur at the DM's discretion, including the possibility of mishaps occurring when such portals are used, such as those detailed in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} under the {@spell teleport} spell.": "虽然新建立的传送门运作异常良好，但经过几个世纪的腐朽和忽视可能会导致传送门渗漏，即传送门逐渐失去一些魔法能量并开始发生故障的过程。通常可以通过传送门两侧的特征开始在另一端出现来注意到渗漏。比如，通往矮人城堡的丛林中的传送门可能坐落在坚固的雕刻石头上，而在另一侧，蕨类植物装饰着堡垒内部的地面。其他效果可能会由DM自行决定，包括当使用这种传送门时可能发生意外的可能性，比如在{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}法术下详细描述的那些。",
	"Portals are two-dimensional areas, usually a circle with a radius of up to 15 feet, bus sometimes square, rectangular, or another shape.": "传送门是二维区域，通常是一个半径长达15英尺的圆形，但有时也可能是正方形、长方形或其他形状。",
	"Things are never certain in the many lands of Faerûn and the Realms Below, and portals are not always entirely reliable. Portal-makers have created, through design or mischance, portals with many insidious and dangerous characteristics.": "在费伦诸地和下属领域，事情从来都不是确定的，传送门也并非总是完全可靠的。传送门制造者们创造了许多具有阴险和危险特征的传送门，无论是出于设计还是意外。",
	"These portals transport only the creatures that use them, not the creatures' clothing and equipment. Such portals are often used defensively to render would-be intruders vulnerable after they use the portals. A rare and more difficult variation of this type of portal transports creatures to one area and their equipment to another.": "这些传送门只传送使用它们的生物，而不传送生物的衣物和装备。这种传送门通常被用于防御，使潜在的入侵者在使用传送门后变得脆弱。这种类型的传送门的一种罕见且更困难的变体会将生物传送到一个区域，而将它们的装备传送到另一个区域。",

	"The other types of unusual portals are generally created through careful effort by their makers. Malfunctioning portals, on the other hand, are almost always unintended.": "其他类型的不寻常传送门通常是由制造者精心制作的。另一方面，出现故障的传送门几乎总是意外的。",
	"Over the centuries, prodigious forces have swept through Toril, profoundly affecting magic. Because of decades, centuries, or millennia of magical wear and tear, rampaging wild magic, or the pervading faerzress to which they have been exposed, many ancient dweomers have gone slowly awry. Portals are no exception.": "数个世纪以来，强大的力量席卷托瑞尔，深刻影响了魔法。由于数十年、数个世纪或数千年的魔法磨损，肆虐的狂野魔法，或者它们所暴露的普遍法尔雷斯，许多古老的咒文逐渐失效。传送门也不例外。",
	"A malfunctioning portal is usually at least a century old, but many are far older. Using one can have many different results. Roll once on the Portal Malfunction table each time a malfunctioning portal is activated. If such a portal functions continuously, the effect lasts {@dice 1d10} rounds and anyone using the portal during that time is subject to the effect.": "一个出故障的传送门通常至少有一个世纪的历史，但许多传送门更古老。使用传送门可能会产生许多不同的结果。每次激活一个出故障的传送门时，在传送门故障表上投掷一次骰子。如果这样的传送门持续运作，效果持续{@dice 1d10}回合，任何在此期间使用传送门的人都会受到影响。",

	"Transparent portals are very difficult to find, and are exceptional for covert transportation. These portals are only transparent in one direction, so while creatures on one side of the portal can see what is happening at the other side, creatures on the other side find the portal indistinguishable from a normal doorway. These portals are exceptionally difficult and expensive to create.": "透明传送门非常难以找到，对于秘密传送非常有效。这些传送门只在一个方向上是透明的，因此，一个方向上的生物可以看到另一边发生的事情，而另一边的生物则认为传送门和普通的门没有区别。创建这些传送门异常困难且昂贵。",
	"These portals are hazardous in the extreme for those who are unfamiliar with their quirks. Creatures using these portals are transported to any one of several preset locations. The destination sequence may follow a set pattern or may be random.": "对于不熟悉这些门户的人来说，它们极其危险。使用这些门户的生物会被传送到几个预设的位置之一。目的地的顺序可能遵循一定的模式，也可能是随机的。",
	"Some variable portals have keys that allow users to choose a specific destination served by the portal.

	"The surface world is marked by mighty mountains, high plateaus, and vast plains. The Underdark possesses none of these features, but it does have physical features all its own. Unlike the surface world, the Underdark is uniquely three-dimensional. Knowing the direction of true north is not enough to navigate the Realms Below; a traveler must also know the depth underground of her destination. It is possible to find the correct coordinates but still be several miles too deep or too shallow.": "地表世界以雄伟的山脉、高原和广阔的平原为特征。地底世界没有这些特征，但它确实拥有独特的物理特征。与地表世界不同，地底世界是独特的三维空间。仅仅知道真正北方的方向并不足以在地下世界中导航；旅行者还必须知道她目的地的地下深度。有可能找到正确的坐标，但仍然可能深入或浅出数英里。",
	"Many of the Underdark's features can be explained as nothing more than the results of purely physical forces, albeit sometimes on a grand scale. Other features would be unlikely or even impossible in worlds where magic, elementals, planar interstices, and divine caprice did not help to shape the deep places.": "Underdark（地底世界）的许多特征可以解释为纯粹物理力量的结果，尽管有时是在宏大的尺度上。其他特征在没有魔法、元素、平面间隙和神圣干预的世界中可能是不太可能甚至不可能的，这些力量帮助塑造了深处的地方。",
	"Vast, empty voids of awesome scope, Faerûn's abysses are rare features that can form insuperable barriers to travel. An abyss is simply a great open space, sometimes many dozens of miles in breadth and virtually bottomless. Some Underdark abysses are scores of miles deep. The difference between an abyss and a vault is difficult to define, but as a general rule, a vast space approachable from its higher reaches is an abyss, while the same space approachable from the floor might be better described as a vault. Abysses tend to be larger and deeper than areas that are considered vaults, but this is not always the case.": "广阔、空旷的恐怖深渊，费伦的深渊是罕见的地形特征，可能形成无法逾越的旅行障碍。深渊只是一个巨大的开阔空间，有时宽度可达数十英里，几乎无底。一些地底深渊有数十英里深。深渊和穹顶之间的区别很难定义，但一般规则是，从高处可接近的广阔空间是深渊，而从地面可接近的同一空间可能更适合描述为穹顶。深渊往往比被视为穹顶的区域更大更深，但并非总是如此。",
	"Like the starkest mountains of the Lands Above, abysses are often completely impassable to anything without wings. Underdark civilizations near such features sometimes carve out harrowing ledge-paths to circle the tremendous void of the neighboring abyss, or endless stairs to descend its walls.": "就像上层之地最陡峭的山脉一样，深渊对于没有翅膀的生物来说通常是完全无法逾越的。在靠近这些地貌的地底文明有时会开凿令人胆寒的岩壁小径，绕过邻近深渊的巨大虚空，或者修建无尽的楼梯沿着深渊的墙壁而下。",
	"Perhaps the most common topographical feature of the Underdark, a cave system consists of a series of caverns and passages that may stretch for miles. Caves can be formed by several different methods, but the most common is the action of flowing water. Cave systems often twist, turn, climb, and drop in a maddening fashion, forming threedimensional mazes that dishearten even the most determined mapmakers.": "也许是地底世界最常见的地形特征，洞穴系统由一系列洞穴和通道组成，可能延伸数英里。洞穴可以通过几种不同的方式形成，但最常见的是流动水的作用。洞穴系统经常扭曲、转折、攀爬和下降，以令人发狂的方式形成三维迷宫，甚至让最坚定的制图者望而却步。",
	"Caves vary widely in terms of their habitability. Living caves that include streams or rivers are full of life (by Underdark standards) and can often support surprisingly large populations, especially of improbably large and ferocious monsters. Other caves may be barren wastelands, without food or water.": "洞穴在可居住性方面差异很大。那些有溪流或河流的生活洞穴充满了生命（按照暗域标准），通常可以支持令人惊讶的大量人口，尤其是那些巨大而凶猛的怪物。其他洞穴可能是贫瘠之地，没有食物或水源。",
	"Over the course of a hundred or more centuries, Faerûn's deep caverns and vaults have been expanded tremendously by the delving of various Underdark races. Thus, the term dungeon when applied to the Underdark means a structure excavated from the surrounding rock by intelligent creatures. For example, a great duergar city delved into the wall of a vault might be considered a large dungeon, with halls and passageways extending for miles from its entrance-ways. Dungeon complexes often serve to link two natural features (such as two or more vaults close to each other) with a system of artificial caves that vastly extends the scope of a natural cave system.": "在过去的一百个世纪或更长时间里，费伦大陆的深洞和地下室已经被各种地下种族的开凿大大扩展。因此，当应用于地下世界时，地牢一词意味着被智能生物从周围的岩石中开凿出来的结构。例如，一个被深入挖掘到一个地下室墙壁中的巨大矮人城市可能被视为一个大型地牢，其大厅和走廊从入口处延伸数英里。地牢复合体通常用于连接两个自然特征（例如彼此靠近的两个或更多地下室），并通过一系列人工洞穴大大扩展了自然洞穴系统的范围。",
	"Dungeons come in two varieties—abandoned and occupied. Since they are not sources of food or water in and of themselves, empty dungeons do not necessarily attract Underdark settlers. However, dungeons are often supremely well suited for defense, and a dungeon that happens to be near a rich area such as a living cave is almost certain to be occupied by something, even if the original builders are long gone.": "地牢有两种类型——废弃的和被占据的。由于它们本身不是食物或水的来源，空地牢不一定会吸引地底世界的定居者。然而，地牢通常非常适合用于防御，一个恰好靠近富饶区域（如活洞穴）的地牢几乎肯定会被某种生物占据，即使最初的建造者早已离去。",
	"Just as on the surface, water can carve deep canyons and gorges in the Underdark. An Underdark gorge is nothing more than a cave that runs vertically instead of horizontally. Gorges often feature streams (and therefore life and food), although the difficulty of the terrain makes a gorge less desirable as a residence than a living cave with less extreme topography.": "就像在地表上一样，水可以在地下世界雕刻出深深的峡谷和峡谷。地下世界的峡谷只不过是一个垂直而不是水平延伸的洞穴。峡谷通常有溪流（因此有生命和食物），尽管地形的困难使峡谷不如地形较为平缓的洞穴那样适合居住。",
	"Since gorges can run for many miles, they often serve as the highways of the Underdark. Travel along the floor of a gorge can be very difficult, but many Underdark races take steps to improve these natural roads for the use of their own merchants and hunters. Gorges also offer good opportunities to change depth and perhaps access another level quickly, through a little climbing.": "由于峡谷可以延绵数英里，它们经常被用作地下世界的高速公路。沿着峡谷底部旅行可能非常困难，但许多地下世界的种族会采取措施来改善这些自然道路，以便他们自己的商人和猎人使用。峡谷还提供了很好的机会来改变深度，也许通过一点攀爬就能快速到达另一个层次。",
	"Water is common in the Upperdark, since runoff from the surface frequently drains into cave systems below-ground. In many areas, the water table is close enough to the surface that only the most shallow cave systems can form. However, due to the unusual factors involved in the creation of Faerûn's Underdark, a water table 20 feet below-ground does not necessarily mean that air-filled caves don't exist at greater depths. Planar connections, particularly to the Planes of Earth and Water, make very unlikely hydrology possible.": "在上暗界，水很常见，因为地表径流经常流入地下洞穴系统。在许多地区，地下水位距离地表很近，只有最浅的洞穴系统才能形成。然而，由于在创造费伦地下世界时涉及到的不寻常因素，地下20英尺处的地下水位并不一定意味着在更深的深度不存在充满空气的洞穴。位面连接，特别是与地与水位面的连接，使得非常不太可能的水文地质成为可能。",
	"Typically, a body of fresh water is called a lake. Underdark lakes range in size from small pools to inland seas hundreds of miles in extent. Large lakes typically occupy either tremendous vaults or connected networks of partially submerged caves. The Lake of Shadows and the Giant's Chalice are examples of the former type, and the Darklake is an example of the latter. If a lake has both an inlet and an outlet, its water is usually drinkable, but lakes that are not refreshed from time to time may stagnate.": "通常，一片淡水被称为湖泊。地底湖泊的大小各不相同，从小水池到数百英里范围内的内陆海都有。大型湖泊通常占据着巨大的拱顶或部分被水淹没的洞穴网络。暗影湖和巨人之杯就是前一种类型的例子，而黑湖则是后一种类型的例子。如果一个湖泊既有进水口又有出水口，那么它的水通常是可以饮用的，但长时间不得到更新的湖泊可能会变得污浊。",
	"Most lakes are found in the Upperdark or Middledark. Bodies of water that collect in the Lowerdark simply can't drain to any lower elevations, so they tend to be seas (brackish water) instead. However, planar connections to the Elemental Plane of Water mean that at least a few of the bodies of water in the Lowerdark hold fresh water.": "大多数湖泊都位于上暗域或中暗域。在下暗域中积聚的水体无法流向更低的海拔，因此它们往往是海洋(咸水)。然而，与水元素位面的连接意味着下暗域中至少有一些水体是淡水。",
	"Large lakes can form the best and most accessible highways of the Underdark. In many places, however, the cavern ceiling descends to meet the water, making the lake impassable to all but aquatic creatures.": "大湖可以成为地底世界最好、最便捷的公路。然而，在许多地方，洞穴的天花板会下降到水面，使得湖泊除了水生生物外，其他生物无法通过。",
	"Unlike gorges, rifts are not formed by erosion. Rather, they are the scars of tremendous upheavals deep in the earth. Rifts are places where vast blocks of stone rose, sunk, or slid past one another in long-ago cataclysms, leaving tremendous chasms. Rifts may be dozens or even hundreds of miles in length, and sometimes miles deep, but they are rarely very wide—most are less than a bow-shot across.": "与峡谷不同，裂谷并非由侵蚀形成。相反，它们是地球深处巨大动荡的伤痕。裂谷是巨大的石块在古老的灾变中上升、下沉或相互滑动的地方，留下了巨大的深渊。裂谷可能长达数十甚至数百英里，有时深达数英里，但它们很少很宽——大多数不到一箭之宽。",
	"Rifts sometimes break apart preexisting features such as cave systems, presenting formidable obstacles to creatures traveling through caves. In order to continue when faced with a rift, the traveler must climb or descend to the appropriate level on the far side. Like gorges, rifts often serve as vertical highways in the Underdark, offering travelers the opportunity to change depth quickly.": "裂隙有时会破坏诸如洞穴系统之类的现有特征，给穿越洞穴的生物带来巨大障碍。面对裂隙时，旅行者必须爬上或下降到对面的合适层次才能继续前行。与峡谷一样，裂隙经常作为地下世界的垂直高速公路，为旅行者提供快速改变深度的机会。",
	"Underdark rivers tend to be swift, violent, and treacherous. It is a rare river indeed that flows level and smooth for more than a few miles at a time before disappearing into a deep gorge or sinkhole in a fuming waterfall. Rivers are the great builders of the Underdark, the natural force that sculpts great caverns and brings life-giving energy and food to sustain the Underdark ecology. Most rivers are surrounded by a halo of living caves, which can be valuable real estate indeed.": "地底河流往往湍急、猛烈且隐险。在消失到深谷或冒着烟雾的瀑布流入深坑之前，很少有河流能够平缓顺畅地流过几英里。河流是地底的伟大建筑者，是雕刻巨大洞穴并为维持地底生态系统带来生命能量和食物的自然力量。大多数河流周围都被一圈生命洞穴所环绕，这些洞穴的价值确实非常珍贵。",
	"Perhaps the most wondrous of the Underdark's features are the vast, shadowed seas of the deep earth. Seas are saltwater bodies, not fresh, and most of them are found in the Lowerdark, though Underdark seas also occur at higher spots beneath Faerûn's surface oceans. While air-filled cave systems may extend for dozens or even hundreds of miles beneath the oceans above, or form air-locked siphons of extraordinary size, these features are exceptional. Most caves beneath large bodies of saltwater are simply subterranean extensions of surface oceans.": "也许地底世界最奇妙的特征之一是深邃大地中的广阔阴影海洋。海洋是盐水体，而非淡水，大部分位于深暗地下(Lowerdark)，尽管地底海洋也会出现在法罗的表面海洋下方更高的地方。虽然充满空气的洞穴系统可能延伸至位于海洋上方的洞穴之下几十甚至几百英里，或形成非常庞大的气密虹吸管，但这些特征都是例外。大多数位于大片盐水下方的洞穴只是表面海洋的地下延伸。",
	"Seas tend to form in the largest of vaults, occupying caverns large enough to be miniature worlds in their own right. Like the lakes, seas offer some of the best roads in the Underdark, and many are heavily traveled.": "海洋往往形成在最大的拱顶下，占据足够大的洞穴，可以成为一个独立的微型世界。像湖泊一样，海洋在地下世界提供了一些最便捷的道路，许多海洋被频繁地使用。",
	"Sometimes natural processes form deep pits or wells in the earth. The shaft of such a structure may be carved out by water flowing straight downward in a subterranean waterfall, or created by volcanic activity. Unlike a gorge or a rift, a shaft tends to be a relatively small feature (usually less than a bow shot in diameter), but it may plummet for miles straight down.": "有时自然过程会在地球上形成深坑或井。这样一个结构的竖井可能是由地下瀑布中直流的水侵蚀而成，或者是由火山活动形成的。与峡谷或裂缝不同，竖井往往是一个相对较小的特征（通常直径不超过一箭射程），但它可能会直直地向下延伸数英里。",
	"Because of their relatively small crosssections, shafts often serve to channel air movement between disparate portions of the Underdark. In places where the conditions are extreme (for example, a shaft near a superheated magma chamber), the air movement can also be extreme. Screaming winds might roar up or down a shaft in a scouring blast that would put a hurricane to shame. Sometimes, cave systems \"breathe\" in conjunction with changes in the surface world above, resulting in tremendous rushes of wind in and out through shafts every day.": "由于其相对较小的横截面，(Shafts)通常用于在地下世界的不同部分之间引导空气流动。在条件极端的地方（例如，靠近超热岩浆室的通道），空气流动也可能极端。尖叫的风可能会在通道中呼啸而过，形成一股冲击力强大的气流，足以让飓风汗颜。有时，洞穴系统会与地表世界的变化同步“呼吸”，导致每天通过通道进出的风势汹涌。",
	"A tunnel is simply a passage that connects one place with another. Most are cut by creatures, though some are the results of natural movements of the earth and other forces. Underdark races often cut very ambitious tunnels to link multiple cave systems. Though such dreary passageways may be dozens of miles in length, most are only 10 or 20 feet across. Other tunnels are the work of burrowing monsters such as delvers, purple worms, and umber hulks. These \"natural\" tunnels may be twisting, turning mazes of intersecting passages.": "一个隧道简单地连接一个地方与另一个地方的通道。大多数是被生物切割出来的，尽管有些是地球的自然运动和其他力量的结果。地底世界的种族经常切割非常雄心勃勃的隧道，以连接多个洞穴系统。尽管这样的阴暗通道可能长达数十英里，但大多数只有10或20英尺宽。其他隧道是由掘地怪物如挖掘者、紫色蠕虫和褐色巨像所创造的。这些“自然”隧道可能是交错通道的扭曲、转弯迷宫。",
	"Tunnels are some of the Underdark's most useful roads, but they severely restrict a traveler's options. If you don't like where a tunnel leads, you really have no choice but to go back the way you came. Tunnels also offer few hiding places for those who can't blend in with stone, so often the only way to escape from a predator is to run—and hope you're faster.": "隧道是地下暗域中最有用的道路之一，但它们严重限制了旅行者的选择。如果你不喜欢隧道通往的地方，那么你真的别无选择，只能原路返回。隧道也为那些无法与石头融为一体的人提供了很少的藏身之处，因此逃离捕食者的唯一方法通常是奔跑——希望你更快。",
	"The higher reaches of the Underdark consist of immense networks of relatively small caves, but as a traveler descends, the numbers of caves decreases while the size of the individual caves increases. A large cave near the surface may consist of a few dozen linked chambers, each perhaps a few hundred feet long and a few dozen feet wide. But deeper down are openings in the earth that dwarf any surface dweller's conception of a cave.": "在地下世界的高处，有着庞大的相对较小的洞穴网络，但随着旅行者下降，洞穴的数量减少，而个别洞穴的大小增加。靠近地表的一个大洞穴可能由几十个相连的房间组成，每个房间可能长几百英尺，宽几十英尺。但更深处有地面上的开口，比任何地表居民对洞穴的概念都要大。",
	"A typical vault may be 2 to 4 miles across and as much as 1 mile high. Some, however, sprawl for 50 miles or more and reach heights of 5 or 6 miles from the floor. Larger vaults often feature immense columns—huge piers of natural rock that help to buttress the soaring ceiling. Some were formed by unthinkably massive pieces of the world grinding past each other in the very dawn of time, others by the influence of the Underdark's native magic, and still others by the confluence of planar characteristics in buried planar connections. However it was formed, a vault is a world in miniature, with its own streams, lakes, hills, and plateaus all contained in a single vast cavern.": "一个典型的地下室可能横跨2到4英里，高达1英里。然而，有些地下室延伸至50英里甚至更远，高度可达5或6英里。更大的地下室通常有巨大的柱子——天然岩石的巨大支柱，有助于支撑高耸的天花板。一些地下室是在时间的黎明时期，世界上无法想象的巨大碎片相互摩擦而形成的，另一些是由地下暗域的本地魔法影响形成的，还有一些是由埋藏的位面连接中位面特征的汇合形成的。无论是如何形成的，地下室都是一个微型世界，拥有自己的溪流、湖泊、丘陵和高原，都包含在一个巨大的洞穴中。",
	"Vaults are almost always highly desirable territories, since they usually offer enough space and resources to support huge forests of fungus, moss, and other strange growths. By Underdark standards, most vaults teem with life, so it comes as no surprise that they support the most powerful and numerous of Underdark settlements. Some stories even tell of illuminated vaults, places where sun-bright crystals in the ceilings blaze with the intensity of true daylight and support green plants and surface-like fauna in abundance.": "地下室几乎总是极具吸引力的领土，因为它们通常提供足够的空间和资源来支持大片的真菌、苔藓和其他奇怪的生长物。按照地下世界的标准，大多数地下室都充满了生命，因此毫不奇怪它们支撑着地底世界中最强大和最众多的定居点。一些故事甚至讲述了被照亮的地下室，那里的天花板上闪耀着像真正白昼一样明亮的太阳水晶，并且大量支持着绿色植物和类似地表的动植物。",
	"It is not universally true in Faerûn that descending 40 or 50 miles straight down in any spot brings a traveler to magma. Volcanic activity is extremely variable in the Underdark. Isolated pools of magma seep up almost to the surface in all sorts of places without any other volcanic activity, and in other places deep tunnels and vaults support humanoid settlements at depths where magma should be all that's present. Again, planar anomalies, deific intervention, and the powerful magic of the earth itself are likely to blame. Whatever the cause of these surprising conditions, racing rivers of molten rock, caverns full of brimstone and sulfurous reek, and scalding geysers and hot springs can be found at almost any depth in the Underdark. Underdark volcanoes aren't really mountains—they are usually tremendous fissures or magma chambers that can vomit deadly rivers of lava into nearby caverns with little or no warning.": "在费伦(Faerûn)并非普遍真实的是，无论在哪个地方，向下直降40或50英里并不会带领旅行者到达岩浆。地底世界的火山活动极为不稳定。孤立的岩浆池在各种地方几乎渗透至地表，而没有其他火山活动，而在其他地方，深深的隧道和地下室支撑着人类定居点，这些地方的深度应该只有岩浆存在。同样，位面异常、神明干预以及地球本身的强大魔法可能是罪魁祸首。无论是什么原因导致了这些令人惊讶的条件，熔岩河流、充满硫磺和硫磺味的洞穴，以及滚烫的间歇泉和温泉几乎可以在地底世界的任何深度找到。地底世界的火山并不是真正的山脉——它们通常是巨大的裂缝或岩浆室，可以在附近的洞穴中喷射致命的熔岩河流，而几乎没有任何警告。",
	"All the topographical features of the Underdark share one thing in common: they're surrounded by rock. Rock in its various forms is every bit as relevant to the denizens of the Underdark as weather is to surface folk. Understanding the significance of different sorts of rock often means the difference between life and death for those who live in the Realms Below.": "地下世界的所有地形特征都有一个共同点：它们被岩石环绕着。各种形式的岩石对地下世界的居民来说和天气对地表居民一样重要。了解不同种类岩石的重要性通常意味着对那些生活在地下世界的人来说生死攸关。",
	"Rocks are divided into four categories: sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic, and magimorphic. These labels describe how the rock was formed. These categories of rock vary widely in their armor class (AC), as shown below.": "岩石分为四类：沉积岩、火成岩、变质岩和魔晶岩。这些标签描述了岩石的形成方式。如下所示，这些岩石类别在其护甲等级（AC）上有很大差异。",
	"Soft Sedimentary (sandstone, shale)": "软沉积岩（砂岩，页岩）",
	"Hard Sedimentary (limestone)": "坚硬沉积岩（石灰岩）",
	"Igneous (basalt, rhyolite)": "火成岩（玄武岩，流纹岩）",
	"Metamorphic (gneiss, granite, marble)": "变质岩（片麻岩，花岗岩，大理石）",
	"Magimorphic (varies as it is derived from previous rock types)": "魔变岩（从先前的岩石类型派生而来，因此会有所不同）",
	"Sedimentary rock formed from softer clays and deposits of organic matter long ago. These materials were compacted into discrete layers in the same sort of process that turns snow into glacial ice. Sedimentary rock is soft and easily weathered, which means that flowing water can gouge vast cave systems from it in a relatively short time, geologically speaking.": "古代由较软的黏土和有机物质沉积形成的沉积岩。这些材料经过压实，形成了离散的层，就像将雪变成冰川冰的过程一样。沉积岩较软，容易风化，这意味着在地质时间上，流动的水可以相对较短的时间内从中切割出巨大的洞穴系统。",
	"Many of the classic cave features, such as stalagmites and stalactites, are found in caves formed from sedimentary rock. Such features are called solution-based, or dripstone, formations because they form from the slow motion and evaporation of water that contains dissolved minerals.": "许多经典的洞穴特征，如石笋和石钟乳，都可以在由沉积岩形成的洞穴中找到。这些特征被称为溶解型或滴石形态，因为它们是由含有溶解矿物质的水缓慢流动和蒸发形成的。",
	"A solution-based rock formation is considered \"living\" if it is still in the process of forming. With enough patience and time, the growth patterns of such formations can be shaped, although it may take dozens of years for such alterations to become evident. Some Underdark races, such as the udadrow and the svirfneblin, occasionally stone shape deposits into particular forms.": "如果一个基于解决问题的岩石形态仍在形成过程中，它被认为是“活的”。通过足够的耐心和时间，这些形态的生长模式可以被塑造，尽管这种改变可能需要几十年才能显现出来。一些地底种族，如乌达德罗(`udadrow`)和斯维弗内布林(`svirfneblin`)，偶尔会将石块形成成特定的形态。",
	"Mineral-laden water drips downward, creating a build-up of rock on the ceiling of a cavern.": "富含矿物质的水滴往下滴，形成了洞穴天花板上的岩石积聚。",
	"When mineral-heavy water drips down to the floor, the bits of rock and mineral start to pile up, creating a slowly growing protrusion on the floor.": "当富含矿物质的水滴到地板上时，岩石和矿物质的碎片开始堆积，形成地板上逐渐增长的突起。",
	"When a stalactite and a stalagmite meet and join, they're no longer referred to by their previous names. The resulting formation is called a column.": "当一根石笋和一根石笋结合在一起时，它们不再被称为之前的名字。这种形成的结构被称为柱状石柱(Column)。",
	"Sometimes mineral-rich water drips too vigorously to form a coherent stalagmite. Where this occurs, a piece of gravel or bone might become coated with mineral deposits and polished to a round and smooth shape by the flowing water. Such an object is called a cave pearl. A well-shaped pearl with good color and texture is worth between 5 gp and 50 gp. Cost: 25 gp (average).": "有时，富含矿物质的水滴落得太过猛烈，无法形成一个连贯的钟乳石。在这种情况下，一块碎石或骨头可能会被矿物质沉积覆盖，并被流动的水打磨成圆滑的形状。这样的物体被称为洞穴珍珠。一个形状完美、颜色和质地良好的珍珠价值在5gp到50gp之间。价格：25gp（平均价）。",
	"These terms refer to dripstone in the form of rippled, wavy, or folded sheets. Curtains and draperies are thinner, often translucent, and resonant. Blankets are thicker, so they tend to muffle sound a bit. Often these features have stripes of different colors.": "这些术语指的是以波纹、波浪或折叠片状形式的滴石。窗帘和挂帘较薄，通常半透明，有共鸣效果。毯子较厚，因此它们往往会稍微降低声音。通常这些特征会有不同颜色的条纹。",
	"A layer of deposited material that follows the shape of the underlying walls or floor is called flowstone. A flowstone formation often has draperies at its lower end.": "一层沉积物，遵循基础墙壁或地板的形状被称为流石(flowstone)。流石形成通常在其下端有悬垂状(draperies)。",
	"These thin flutes, each the width of a drop of water, are how stalactites begin.": "这些细长的长笛，每一根都像一滴水那样宽，就是钟乳石开始形成的方式。",
	"Water flowing through a cave wall or ceiling sometimes builds up sediment on both sides of its entry point, creating two parallel plates on either side of a thin, sheet-like crack.": "水流穿过洞穴的墙壁或天花板时，有时会在进入点的两侧堆积沉积物，形成两个平行板，夹在一个薄薄的、类似薄片的裂缝两侧。",
	"This knobby, crystalline growth forms in a wide variety of cave conditions and is sometimes called cave coral.": "这种多瘤的、结晶的生长体形成在各种洞穴条件下，有时被称为洞穴珊瑚。",
	"Boxwork forms when softer rock wears away, leaving a harder crystalline network of thin blades poking out from a ceiling, floor, or wall.": "当较软的岩石磨损后，留下了一种更坚硬的晶体薄片网络，从天花板、地板或墙壁上伸出，形成了盒状结构。",
	"These crystalline formations, also called cave flowers, are valued by several Underdark races for their aesthetic beauty and their commercial value. Crystal flowers are usually made of halite (simple table salt), gypsum, or some other minerals. The petals are fibrous or prismatic crystals that resemble growing seedlings. Halite flowers often grace the table settings of wealthy udadrow on special occasions. Even illithids occasionally carry salt in crystal flower form to add earthy spice to their brain meals. Cost: 25 gp; Weight 1 lb.": "这些晶体形成物，也被称为洞穴花朵，在几个地底种族中因其美学价值和商业价值而备受重视。晶体花通常由食盐（简单的食用盐）、石膏或其他一些矿物制成。花瓣是纤维状或棱柱状的晶体，类似于生长中的幼苗。食盐花经常装饰富有的乌达德罗在特殊场合的餐桌。甚至灵魔偶尔也会携带晶体花形式的盐，为他们的脑食品添加泥土味的香料。价格：25 gp；重量1 磅。",
	"This term refers to crystal growths in which the crystal faces and structure are visible to unaided sight. Many-faceted crystals that form underwater are called pool spars.": "这个术语指的是晶体生长，其中晶体的面和结构可以用肉眼看到。在水下形成的多面晶体被称为(泳池石)(pool spars)。",
	"Igneous features are formed or influenced by fire—usually magma chambers and flows, although openings into the Elemental Plane of Fire are not uncommon in many parts of the Underdark.": "火成岩特征是由火焰形成或影响的——通常是岩浆室和岩浆流，尽管通往火元素位面的开口在地下世界的许多地方并不少见。",
	"While molten rock is underground, it is called magma. If it erupts to the surface from a volcano, it is called lava.": "当熔岩在地下时，它被称为岩浆。如果从火山喷发到地表，它被称为熔岩。",
	"Water heated by volcanic forces often bubbles up through the ground in hot springs. Some of these springs make it to the surface; others can be found in caverns underground. Often, the water is so laden with sulfur and other minerals that it is undrinkable.": "由火山力量加热的水经常会从地下冒出来，形成温泉。其中一些温泉会涌出地表，而另一些则隐藏在地下洞穴中。通常，这些水含有大量硫磺和其他矿物质，因此不能饮用。",
	"A geyser consists of a deep fissure or well in which water can accumulate and be heated to high temperatures and sent through a thin shaft that leads from this pool of superheated water to the surface. Periodically, a fountain-like jet of hot water and steam erupts, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 6d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The intervals of eruption can be regular or irregular.": "一个间歇泉由一个深裂缝或井组成，水可以在其中积聚并被加热至高温，然后通过一条细管从这个超热水池通往地表。定期地，一个类似喷泉的热水和蒸汽喷发出来，形成一个高20英尺，半径5英尺的间歇泉。间歇泉区域内的每个生物必须进行一次 DC 15 的敏捷豁免检定，未通过检定的生物会受到 {@damage 6d6} 火焰伤害，通过检定的生物则只受到一半伤害。喷发的间隔可以是规律的或不规律的。",
	"These tubes form after lava has flowed from a volcano. The surface of the lava cools and solidifies while the interior is still liquid. This uneven cooling creates a crust that resembles a tube. Lava tubes can branch and fork, following the passage of the lava. Because the cooling can happen over several intervals, it's also possible to have a tube within a tube.": "这些管道是在火山喷发后熔岩流动形成的。熔岩表面冷却凝固，而内部仍然是液态的。这种不均匀的冷却形成了类似管道的外壳。熔岩管道可以分叉和分支，沿着熔岩的通道延伸。由于冷却可能在几个间隔内发生，所以在一个管道内还可能有另一个管道。",
	"Rock that has been made liquid and frothy hardens into light, porous stone called pumice.": "被熔化并起泡的岩石会变硬，形成一种轻、多孔的石头，称为浮石(pumice)。",
	"Stalactites formed by lava happen in two main ways. Tubular lava stalactites are usually formed by volcanic gases. Gas flows through lava in which different minerals are solidifying at quicker or slower rates, forming long tubes. The downward drips from such formations may form stalagmites. The second type of lava stalactite is called a shark-tooth stalactite. This formation occurs when flowing lava coats existing protrusions, resulting in a broad shape that narrows to a point.": "熔岩形成的钟乳石主要有两种方式。管状熔岩钟乳石通常是由火山气体形成的。气体流经熔岩，其中不同的矿物以不同速度凝固，形成长管。从这种形成物滴下的水滴可能形成石笋。第二种类型的熔岩钟乳石称为鲨齿钟乳石。这种形成是由流动的熔岩包裹现有的突起而形成的，结果是一个宽阔的形状，逐渐变尖。",
	"Drip stalagmites form from material that pours off of or out of tubular lava stalactites. These puddles of lava may mound up in stalagmites.": "滴状石笋是由从管状熔岩钟乳滴落或流出的材料形成的。这些熔岩的水坑可能会堆积成石笋。",
	"Udadrow architects use this term to refer to obsidian, which they value for its glossy black appearance. Spiderstone is frequently used in udadrow buildings that feature spider motifs.": "乌达德罗建筑师使用这个术语来指代黑曜石，他们因其光泽黑色外观而重视。在以蜘蛛图案为特色的乌达德罗建筑中经常使用蜘蛛石。",
	"Often found in deserts or volcanic regions, these hollow rocks are lined with crystals. In the Underdark, some geodes are immense, growing to the size of caves. One legend tells of a wizard entombed in a 40-foot geode filled with amethyst crystals.": "这些中空的岩石通常出现在沙漠或火山地区，内部镶满了晶体。在地底世界，一些石英晶洞非常巨大，长到了洞穴的大小。有一个传说讲述了一个被埋在一个40英尺高的紫晶石英晶洞中的巫师。",
	"Metamorphic rocks occur where intense heat and pressure act to harden rock and alter its consistency. Marble is a good example of a sedimentary rock (limestone) that volcanic activity has transformed into a much harder stone. Metamorphic rock formations are similar to those of the pre-metamorphic rock, though often compressed. Caves formed from metamorphic rock more often take the form of faults, fissures, or similar discontinuities caused by the movement of adjacent slabs of stone.": "变质岩是在强烈的热量和压力作用下硬化岩石并改变其一致性的地方。大理石是一个很好的例子，它是一种沉积岩（石灰岩），被火山活动转变成了一种更坚硬的石头。变质岩的形成与变质前的岩石相似，尽管通常会被压缩。由变质岩形成的洞穴更常见地采取断层、裂缝或类似的不连续形式，这是由于相邻岩石板块的运动造成的。",
	"Many metallic ore deposits form in metamorphic settings. Some valuable minerals, such as garnet and tourmaline, also form only in such environments. Hence mining-oriented cultures, such as that of the dwarves, tend to settle in areas that feature metamorphic rocks.": "许多金属矿床形成在变质岩环境中。一些有价值的矿物，比如石榴石和电气石，也只会在这种环境中形成。因此，像矮人族那样以采矿为导向的文化往往会定居在以变质岩为特征的地区。",
	"Since metamorphic stone is often dense, hard, and beautiful, some varieties are highly regarded as building materials. Many huge quarries can be found in the depths of the Underdark.": "由于变质岩通常密实、坚硬且美丽，一些品种被高度评价为建筑材料。在地下世界的深处可以找到许多巨大的采石场。",

	"In its natural state, this rock is found only in the Lowerdark, where it is cut in slave-worked quarries and prepared for export to the Middledark and Upperdark. Clear black rock is not common, but it is certainly available to those willing to pay premium prices. To regular and low-light vision, this rock looks black, shiny, and perfectly opaque, but to creatures with {@sense darkvision}, it is perfectly clear. Creatures without {@sense darkvision} often mistake it for obsidian, but udadrow, mind flayers, and other creatures gifted with {@sense darkvision} find it a challenging yet worthwhile stone to incorporate into their strongholds and encampments.": "在其自然状态下，这种岩石只能在下暗界中找到，那里被切割成奴隶工作的采石场，并准备出口到中暗界和上暗界。清晰的黑色岩石并不常见，但对于那些愿意支付高昂价格的人来说，它肯定是可以获得的。对于普通和微弱光线视觉来说，这种岩石看起来是黑色的、有光泽的，完全不透明，但对于具有{@sense darkvision}的生物来说，它是完全透明的。没有{@sense darkvision}的生物经常会将其误认为黑曜石，但乌达德洛(udadrow)、掌脑兽(mind flayers)和其他具有{@sense darkvision}的生物发现将其纳入他们的要塞和营地是具有挑战性但值得的。",
	"This rock breaks very easily and is the bane of miners and travelers anywhere. Crumblestone exists in a precarious equilibrium with the other rocks or strata surrounding it. A Small or larger creature that begins to put its weight onto crumblestone must make a DC 15 Dexterity check or fall when the rock beneath them turns to powder. For flying creatures, this situation rarely poses a problem, but for climbers, an encounter with crumblestone is often deadly. If enough crumblestone gives way in a cavern, a cave-in becomes likely.": "这种岩石非常容易破碎，是矿工和旅行者的噩梦。(`Crumblestone`) 与周围的其他岩石或地层存在着脆弱的平衡。当一个小型或更大的生物开始将重量施加在(`Crumblestone`) 上时，必须进行一次DC 15的敏捷检定，否则当他们踩踏的岩石变成粉末时会摔倒。对于飞行生物，这种情况很少会造成问题，但对于攀岩者来说，与(`Crumblestone`) 的相遇往往是致命的。如果在洞穴中有足够的(`Crumblestone`) 崩塌，就可能发生坍塌。",
	"Beautiful, intricate, and very delicate, crysstone is a rock that resembles spun glass. It is very hard but not at all durable (AC 13, 2 hit points per inch of thickness).

	"Darkstone seems to drink in light. In tunnels that cut through this material, light sources dim, shedding a glow only half as strong as usual. In such a space, a bullseye lantern illuminates a cone only 30-feet long and 10-feet wide, while a torch lights only a 10-foot radius. A daylight spell cast in a darkstone area radiates daylight in only a 30- foot radius.": "暗石似乎吞噬光线。在穿过这种材料的隧道中，光源会变暗，只发出平常强度的一半的光芒。在这样的空间中，一个靶心灯笼只能照亮一个长30英尺、宽10英尺的锥形区域，而一支火把只能照亮一个10英尺半径的区域。在暗石区域施放的《白昼》法术只会在一个30英尺半径范围内辐射白昼。",
	"These rocks grow quickly when exposed to light. In each round of exposure, a photogenerative rock doubles in size until it is sixteen times as large as it was when unlit (4 rounds). Eliminating the light halts its growth, and each hour of uninterrupted darkness reverses the effect of 1 round of light. Some Underdark undead use photogenerative rock in their demesnes to stall light-bearing adventurers until the undead can ready their defenses. Photogenerative rock can also be used to seal a doorway and divert light-bearers into more trap-ridden or better-defended areas.": "这些岩石在暴露在光线下时会快速生长。在每一轮暴露中，一个光生岩石的大小会翻倍，直到它比未照亮时大16倍（4轮）。消除光线会停止它的生长，每小时不间断的黑暗会抵消1轮光照的效果。一些地底不死生物在他们的领地中使用光生岩石来阻止携带光源的冒险者，直到不死生物准备好他们的防御措施。光生岩石也可以用来封住门道，将携带光源者引导到更多陷阱或更好防守的区域。",
	"Events that happen in the presence of this rock imprint upon it for a short time. One cubic foot of photostatic rock picks up impressions in a 10-foot radius and automatically relays them to anyone who touches it later. The effect is similar to that of a {@spell stone tell|JBoE} spell, except that the photostatic property reveals only what happened within its radius in the past hour. Every additional cubic foot of photostatic rock provides 1 more hour of memory and expands the radius of sensitivity by 10 feet. A photostatic rock records only what it witnesses, so it can't record what goes on beyond a closed door.": "在这块光石的存在下发生的事件会在其上留下痕迹一段时间。一立方英尺的光石在10英尺半径内捕捉印象，并在稍后任何接触它的人自动传达这些印象。这种效果类似于{@spell stone tell|JBoE}法术，但光石的特性只显示过去一小时内在其半径内发生的事情。每增加一立方英尺的光石提供1小时的记忆，并将敏感半径扩大10英尺。光石只记录它所见到的事情，因此无法记录封闭门后发生的事情。",
	"Quickstone is the Underdark's answer to quicksand. Like many Realms Below features, it's much more terrible than its surface-world equivalent. Quickstone looks like solid stone and blends into the surrounding rocks, but it functions like {@book quicksand|DMG|5|quicksand} as given in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. The spell {@spell transmute rock|XGE} permanently solidifies quickstone. If a creature becomes caught in quickstone, it can attempt to succeed on a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to escape.": "快石是地底世界对流沙的回应。与许多地下境域特征一样，它比地表世界的等价物更加可怕。快石看起来像坚固的石头，与周围的岩石融为一体，但它的功能类似于{@book quicksand|DMG|5|quicksand}，如{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中所述。法术{@spell transmute rock|XGE}可以永久性地使快石凝固。如果生物被困在快石中，可以尝试进行一次力量检定（{@skill Athletics}）来尝试逃脱。",
	"These rocks have been warped by long-term proximity to a portal leading to the Elemental Plane of Water. Rock gourds are rare, naturally occurring stones, not created magic items, though they register a faint signature of conjuration magic under examination with a detect magic spell. Shaking a rock gourd causes water to dribble out. The ability of these stones to produce up to a gallon of water per day apiece makes them highly-valued commodities in the Middledark and Lowerdark regions, where water is scarce. Cost: 500 gp. Weight 10 lb.": "这些岩石因长期接近通往水元素位面的传送门而扭曲。岩瓜是罕见的自然形成的石头，不是魔法物品，尽管在使用探测魔法咒语检查时会注册微弱的变形魔法特征。摇晃岩瓜会导致水滴出来。这些石头每天能产生多达一加仑的水的能力使它们在Middledark和Lowerdark地区备受珍视，那里的水很稀缺。价格：500 gp。重量10磅。",
	"Sickstone glows with a nauseating, not-quite-green, not-quite-silver light that produces dim light in a 40-foot radius. Each creature that starts its turn within the area of dim light must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 1d6} poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in physical contact with sickstone has disadvantage on their saving throw, and becomes {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour if they fail.": "病石(Sickstone)发出一种令人作呕的、不完全是绿色、也不完全是银色的光芒，在40英尺半径范围内产生微弱光线。每个在微弱光线范围内开始回合的生物必须进行一次DC 12的体质豁免才能，豁免失败则受到{@damage 1d6}毒素伤害，豁免成功则只受到一半伤害。与病石接触的生物在豁免检定时有劣势，并且如果豁免失败，会在接下来的1小时内变成{@condition poisoned}。",
	"This rock is very smooth to the touch. A creature that steps onto an area of slickstone or ends its turn there, must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall {@condition prone}.": "这块岩石摸起来非常光滑。任何生物踩在光滑石块上或结束回合时，必须通过一次 DC 15 的敏捷豁免才能保持站立 {@condition prone}。",
	"Only a newcomer to the Underdark would be naïve enough to think that Toril's deep caverns are formed exclusively of rock. A variety of other materials can form the same sorts of features.": "只有一个对地底世界（Underdark）的新来者才会天真地认为托瑞尔（Toril）的深洞仅仅由岩石构成。其他各种材料也可以形成相同类型的地貌特征。",
	"This \"living rock\" can be found in many saltwater-filled caves. Large clumps of coral often have tunnel-like spaces winding through them, and aquatic creatures such as tritons sometimes use this substance as an architectural medium, building complex structures by forcing it to grow in particular patterns.": "这种“活石”可以在许多盐水洞穴中找到。大团的珊瑚通常有蜿蜒穿过它们的隧道般空间，水生生物如海螺有时会将这种物质用作建筑媒介，通过强迫其按特定模式生长来建造复杂结构。",
	"This term refers to a cave where either seasonal or permanent ice can be found. Since there's little drinkable water in the Underdark, caves containing ice often attract settlers or predators.": "这个术语指的是一个洞穴，里面可能会发现季节性或永久性的冰。由于地底世界缺乏饮用水，含有冰的洞穴通常会吸引定居者或捕食者。",
	"A glacial cave is one formed entirely of ice. Such a cave provides more potential water than an ice cave, but also more potential danger. Fire and other heat sources (even body heat) might be enough to weaken or fracture the ice and start an cave-in.": "一个冰川洞穴完全由冰形成。这样的洞穴提供的潜在水量比冰洞穴更多，但也存在更多潜在危险。火和其他热源（甚至是体热）可能足以削弱或破裂冰块，引发坍塌。",
	"Some areas of the Underdark have a surfeit of bones and remains of the dead. Skeletons range in size from tiny mice to huge behemoths. Moving through a section piled with skeletons means creeping or breaking through tunnels made of bones.": "在地下世界的一些区域，尸骨和死者遗骸比比皆是。骷髅的大小从微小的老鼠到巨大的巨兽不等。穿过一个堆满骷髅的区域意味着要蹑手蹑脚地或者破坏由骨头构成的隧道。",
	"Permanent walls of force are costly to create. Nevertheless, many of them exist in the Underdark. Some block off the territory of one race from another, others act as bridges across deep chasms, and still others serve no discernible purpose.": "在地下城中，制造永久的力场墙是非常昂贵的。然而，许多这样的力场墙存在于地下世界中。有些用来隔离不同种族的领地，有些作为跨越深渊的桥梁，还有一些则没有明显的用途。",
	"Many caverns in the Underdark are full of fungus, much of it innocuous. Rather than expend the resources to hack away all of these fungi, denizens often just create routes between or through large patches of it. Tunnels cut out of mushroom-like material are not unusual sights in the Realms Below.": "地下世界的许多洞穴都长满了真菌，其中大部分是无害的。居民们通常不愿耗费资源去砍掉所有这些真菌，而是选择在它们之间或之中开辟通道。用类似蘑菇的材料开凿的隧道在下界并不少见。",
	"Some caves are formed and shaped by eroding winds and freely flowing water, such as streams or ocean currents. The following features are common in such environments.": "一些洞穴是由侵蚀的风和自由流动的水形成和塑造的，比如溪流或海洋洋流。在这样的环境中，以下特征是常见的。",
	"Strong or constant winds gradually shape caves and caverns. Wind effects may be present in caves that are close to the surface world, portals to the Elemental Plane of Air, or the hot gases emitted by volcanic activity. Wind-shaped caves and caverns are sometimes referred to as Aeolian caves.": "强大或持续的风逐渐塑造洞穴和岩洞。风的影响可能存在于靠近地表世界的洞穴中，这些洞穴可能是通往空气元素位面的门户，或者是火山活动排放的热气体。风形成的洞穴和岩洞有时被称为(`Aeolian`)洞穴。",
	"Subterranean waterways often have air above them, but the amounts vary. A lake might be housed in a vast cavern, but a swiftly moving river might have only one or two places where a swimmer might catch a gulp of air. Even more dangerous are pockets of gases other than air.": "地下水道通常上方有空气，但数量不同。一个湖可能位于一个巨大的洞穴中，但一个迅速流动的河流可能只有一两个地方，游泳者可以吸一口气。更危险的是除空气之外的气体囊。",
	"Regional uplifting of tectonic plates causes rivers to cut deep canyons. Sometimes these gorges provide surface-world entry points to the Underdark. Subterranean rivers also create canyons. Such canyons might or might not have rivers at their bottoms now, since underground rivers often dry up or change course.": "地壳板块的地区隆起导致河流切割出深谷。有时这些峡谷会成为通往暗深世界(Underdark)的地表入口。地下河流也会形成峡谷。这样的峡谷现在可能有也可能没有河流流过，因为地下河流经常会干涸或改变流向。",
	"A swirlhole is a generally circular hole in the rock of a stream bed, eroded by water eddies and rubbed smooth by pebbles.": "旋涡洞是河床岩石上的一种通常呈圆形的洞，是水涡和鹅卵石磨光侵蚀形成的。",
	"The area where fresh water (such as that from a river) and salty ocean water meet is cloudy and called a halocline. Such a region often marks territorial boundaries between aquatic races.": "淡水（比如来自河流的水）和咸海水相遇的区域是混浊的，被称为盐度跃层。这样的区域经常标志着水生种族之间的领土边界。",
	"Seas and oceans are powerful forces that can wear the hardest of rocks down into fine sand. Tides and water flow continuously redistribute this material.": "海洋和海洋是强大的力量，可以将最坚硬的岩石磨成细沙。潮汐和水流不断重新分配这些物质。",
	"Springs, rivers, and the sea can deposit a porous limestone called tufa. Finding this rock indicates that water is (or at least was) nearby.": "泉水、河流和海洋可以沉积一种多孔的石灰岩，称为钙华。发现这种岩石表明水源（或至少曾经）附近。",
	"The Underdark, as written, with its own manners, in the dark.": "根据当地的语言习惯，保持原文中的(%num%)不变，翻译为：地下暗域，以其独特的礼仪，在黑暗中。",
	"Walking through wild caves without end is different than stalking monsters in a dungeon near the surface. Travelers venturing into the Underdark enter a world in which nothing can be taken for granted. Vast portions of the Realms Below are wastelands devoid of food, water, and even light.": "穿行无尽的野生洞穴与在地表附近的地牢中追踪怪物是不同的。冒险者踏入地底世界，一切都不可轻视。地下世界的广阔部分是荒地，缺乏食物、水，甚至光线。",
	"Except for any lanterns that characters bring into the caves, the Underdark is absolutely dark. Coupled with the tomblike silence of most passages, absolute darkness can unnerve even the most experienced delver. Thus, extra lights and oil (or magical means of illumination) are important for any cave trip.": "除了角色带入洞穴的灯笼外，地下世界是绝对黑暗的。加上大多数通道的坟墓般寂静，绝对黑暗甚至可以让最有经验的探险者感到不安。因此，额外的灯光和油（或魔法照明手段）对于任何洞穴探险都是重要的。",
	"Halflings, humans, and other surface dwellers without {@sense darkvision} must carry some form of light with them in order to navigate the Underdark. While torches or lanterns are feasible for relatively short trips, a journey of more than a few days might require dozens of torches and oil flasks, making nonmagical light impractical for long expeditions.": "半身人，人类，和其他地表居民在地下世界中行走时，没有{@sense darkvision}的人必须携带一些光源以便导航。虽然火把或灯笼对于相对短途旅行是可行的，但超过几天的旅程可能需要数十支火把和油瓶，使非魔法光源在长途探险中变得不切实际。",
	"The best and most efficient means of providing light in the Underdark is to use minor alchemical or magical items, such as sunrods or {@spell continual flame} torches. A sunrod is small, light, and long lasting, capable of providing illumination in a 30-foot radius for 6 hours. A party of explorers could easily carry several dozen sunrods, which would provide enough light for many days of travel. At 2 gp apiece, an investment of 100 gp or so is well worth the money.": "在地下世界提供光线的最佳和最有效方式是使用次要的炼金或魔法物品，比如日棒或{@spell continual flame}火炬。日棒小巧轻便，持久耐用，能在30英尺半径范围内提供照明长达6小时。一个探险队可以轻松携带数十支日棒，足够提供多天的旅行照明。每支2金币，投资约100金币是非常值得的。",
	"The {@spell continual flame} torch is potentially cheaper, since the material component costs only 50 gp and the item lasts forever if not destroyed. However, such a torch only illuminates a 20-foot radius.": "这个{@spell continual flame}火炬可能更便宜，因为其材料成本仅为50 gp，且如果未被摧毁，该物品将永远持续下去。然而，这样的火炬只能照亮一个20英尺半径范围。",
	"While most of the Underdark is lightless, some locales possess sources of natural illumination.": "尽管大部分地下世界是漆黑一片，但一些地点拥有自然光源。",
	"Rare forms of lichen, fungi, and moss are bioluminescent. In sufficient quantities, these growths can illuminate large caverns. Most bioluminescent growths are quite dim, so a cavern illuminated by glowing moss or fungi is typically as dark as starlight, although some particularly bright regions might be equal to moonlight.": "罕见的地衣、真菌和苔藓具有生物发光特性。在足够数量的情况下，这些生长物可以照亮大型洞穴。大多数生物发光的生长物都相当昏暗，因此被发光的苔藓或真菌照亮的洞穴通常和星光一样暗，尽管一些特别明亮的区域可能相当于月光。",
	"Areas with exposed pools or streams of magma are illuminated by the dim, ruddy glow of the molten rock. The glare of molten rock is typically equal to moonlight.": "暴露的岩浆池或溪流区域被熔岩微弱而赤红的光芒照亮。熔岩的耀眼光芒通常相当于月光。",
	"Some rare rocks of the Underdark are naturally radiant, ranging in brightness from starlight to full daylight, although daylight equivalence is quite rare. The great vault of Deep Imaskar is roofed with radiant crystal that is as bright as weak surface daylight.": "地下世界的一些稀有岩石天生具有辐射性，亮度范围从星光到满天光明，尽管相当罕见。深埃马斯卡的巨大穹顶覆盖着辐射水晶，亮度如同微弱的地表白昼。",
	"While not naturally luminescent, caverns made partially of reflective stone can be much more easily illuminated by small light sources than normal. Reflective stone quadruples the radius of illumination of any light source brought inside.": "虽然自然不发光，但由反光石部分构成的洞穴可以更容易地被小光源照亮，比普通情况下更明亮。反光石可以使任何带入内部的光源的照明半径增加四倍。",
	"The rarest and most wondrous of natural illuminations in the Realms Below, wizard fire consists of dancing sheets of dim light, like the northern lights of the surface world. This illumination is created by the combination of various gases in an area, and is most often found in chambers that have vents that draw gases from various locations in the Underdark into one location. Though it is only as bright as starlight, wizard fire is strange and beautiful.": "在地下境界中最稀有和最奇妙的自然光照是巫师之火，由一片片微弱的光芒组成，就像地表世界的极光一样。这种光照是由一个区域内各种气体的组合产生的，最常见于那些有通风口将来自地下世界各个地方的气体引入同一位置的洞穴中。尽管它只有星光明亮，巫师之火却是奇异而美丽的。",
	"In general, the Underdark is surprisingly well ventilated. Vast subterranean spaces and the rare planar connection to the Elemental Plane of Air provide plenty of good air for living creatures. However, this is not universally true.": "总的来说，地下世界（（Underdark））出奇地通风良好。广阔的地下空间和与元素界（（Elemental Plane of Air））的稀有连接为生物提供了充足的新鲜空气。然而，并非普遍如此。",
	"Sealed chambers, isolated caves, and waterisolated caverns have finite supplies of breathable air. Creatures that don't breathe need not concern themselves with air quality, but other travelers must be wary of such locations.": "密封的房间，孤立的洞穴和水隔离的洞穴都有有限的可呼吸空气供应。不需要呼吸的生物不必担心空气质量，但其他旅行者必须小心这些地方。",
	"Any enclosed space that is reasonably airtight can quickly become stale or depleted. In general, a medium creature depletes about 1,000 cubic feet of air (a 10-foot cube) every 6 hours. A Small creature requires half as much air, and a large creature requires four times as much. Air becomes stale when it is half of the available are has been depleted.": "任何相对密封的封闭空间都可能很快变得陈旧或缺氧。一般来说，一个中等生物每6小时消耗约1,000立方英尺的空气（一个10英尺立方体）。一个小型生物需要一半的空气，而一个大型生物需要四倍的空气。当可用空气的一半被消耗完时，空气就会变得陈旧。",
	"Regions that are poorly ventilated are not immediately deadly, but stale air can quickly wear out even the hardiest travelers. A breathing creature in an environment of stale air must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of {@condition exhaustion}. Creatures can't recover from {@condition exhaustion} gained in this way until they reach an area of good air.": "通风不良的区域并不会立即致命，但陈旧的空气会迅速耗尽即使是最健壮的旅行者。在陈旧空气环境中的呼吸生物必须在每小时结束时成功通过一次 DC 10 的体质豁免检定，否则会获得 {@condition exhaustion} 的一级。生物无法在到达良好空气区域之前从这种方式获得的 {@condition exhaustion} 中恢复。",
	"Depleted areas can prove deadly in a matter of minutes. A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).": "在缺氧的区域，生物可能在几分钟内就会丧命。生物可以屏住呼吸的时间为1 + 其体质调整值的分钟数（最少30秒）。",
	"When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 Hit Points and is dying, and it can't regain Hit Points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.": "当一个生物呼吸耗尽或窒息时，它可以存活一段回合数，回合数等于其体质调整值（最少1回合）。在它的下一个回合开始时，它的生命值降至0点，处于濒死状态，直到它能够再次呼吸，它无法恢复生命值或被稳定。",
	"Some areas of the Underdark are plagued by air that is not just stale, but actively toxic. Often this situation results from geothermal activity in the vicinity of volcanoes. Sometimes the escaping gases emerge with an audible hiss or a putrid smell, but not always.": "地下世界的一些地区受到的空气不仅仅是陈旧的，而且还有毒。这种情况通常是由于附近火山的地热活动引起的。有时逃逸的气体会发出明显的嘶嘶声或恶臭，但并非总是如此。",
	"Gases tend to concentrate in areas that are isolated in some way from the nearby passages. For example, a passage that dips down sharply and then climbs up again forms a natural, low-lying pocket where deadly fumes can accumulate. An air-filled passage sealed by water siphons at either end could also concentrate deadly gases.": "气体往往会集中在某种方式与附近通道隔离的区域。例如，一个急剧下降然后再次上升的通道形成了一个天然的低洼区，致命的有毒气体可以在那里积聚。两端被水虹吸封闭的充满空气的通道也可能会聚集致命气体。",
	"These gases cause coughing, stinging of the eyes, dizziness, and similar difficulties. A breathing creature exposed to irritating fumes must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw once per minute or become {@condition poisoned}. Recovery from the {@condition poisoned} condition is not possible until the creature leaves the affected area.": "这些气体会引起咳嗽、眼睛刺痛、头晕等症状。暴露在刺激性烟雾中的呼吸生物必须每分钟进行一次 DC 10 的体质豁免检定，否则会变成{@condition poisoned}。只有在生物离开受影响区域后才能恢复{@condition poisoned}状态。",
	"These gases are deadly. A breathing creature that ventures into an area of poison gas must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw each time they breathe, or take {@damage 1d4} poison damage. A breathing creature usually breathes once a round, unless it is holding its breath. If a creature did not start holding its breath before entering an area of poison gas, it can't hold its breath until it leaves the area.": "这些气体是致命的。一个呼吸生物进入毒气区域时，每次呼吸都必须成功通过一次 DC 12（（Constitution）体质）豁免检定，否则会受到 {@damage 1d4} 毒性伤害。一个呼吸生物通常每回合呼吸一次，除非它屏住呼吸。如果一个生物在进入毒气区域之前没有开始屏住呼吸，它就无法在离开该区域之前屏住呼吸。",
	"Some poisonous gases also have the characteristics of irritating fumes, so their presence is obvious. Others, however, offer no telltale burning of the throat or stinging in the eyes to warn creatures of the danger. Any creature exposed to poison gas with a passive {@skill Perception} score of 15 or higher will detect the threat before breathing enough to force a saving throw. A creature with keen smell or a similar trait that enhances its sense of smell automatically detects the presence of poison gas when it comes within 10 feet of an area of poison gas.": "一些有毒气体也具有刺激性气味的特点，因此它们的存在是显而易见的。然而，其他一些气体却没有明显的喉咙灼烧或眼睛刺痛的迹象来警告生物危险。任何暴露在毒气中的生物，如果被动{@skill Perception}检测值为15或更高，将在吸入足够量的气体以强制进行豁免检定之前察觉到威胁。具有敏锐嗅觉或类似增强嗅觉的特质的生物，在接近毒气区域10英尺范围内时会自动察觉到毒气的存在。",
	"Some naturally occurring gases can explode in the presence of open flames. If a burning torch or lit lantern is brought into a pocket of explosive gas, the vapor explodes. All creatures within 10 feet of the explosion must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 3d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature with a passive {@skill Perception} score of 15 or higher can notice the danger one round before the explosion occurs, since the open flame often behaves strangely (burning in a different color or exceptionally brightly) right before the explosion. After an explosion, if the open flame is not removed or extinguished immediately, there is a 50% chance on each subsequent round for an additional explosion to occur.": "一些自然生成的气体在明火的存在下会爆炸。如果一个燃烧的火炬或点燃的灯笼被带入一个含有爆炸性气体的区域，蒸汽会爆炸。爆炸范围内的所有生物必须进行一次 DC 12 的敏捷豁免检定，未通过检定则受到{@damage 3d6}火焰伤害，通过检定则只受到一半伤害。一个被动感知{@skill Perception}达到15或更高的生物可以在爆炸发生前一轮察觉到危险，因为明火在爆炸发生前通常会表现出异常的行为（以不同颜色燃烧或异常明亮）。爆炸后，如果明火没有立即移除或扑灭，每个后续回合都有50%的几率发生额外的爆炸。",
	"The temperature underground varies depending on the depth and the presence of geothermal features, but the vast majority of the Underdark has a moderate temperature throughout the year. It tends to be on the clammy and chilly side, but typical adventuring garb is sufficient to keep characters warm and dry.": "地下的温度取决于深度和地热特征的存在，但绝大多数地底世界的温度在一年中都是适中的。它往往有点潮湿和寒冷，但典型的冒险服装足以让角色保持温暖和干燥。",
	"Water is almost always dangerously cold in the Underdark, since it is never warmed by sunlight. A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of {@condition exhaustion}. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water.": "在地下世界，水几乎总是非常冰冷，因为它从不受阳光加热。一个生物可以在冰冷的水中浸泡的时间长达其体质分数的分钟数，然后才会遭受任何不良影响。在冰冷水中额外度过的每一分钟，生物需要成功通过一次 DC 10 的体质豁免才能避免获得一级{@condition exhaustion}。对冷伤害具有抗性或免疫力的生物自动通过豁免检定，与生活在冰冷水域中的生物一样。",
	"When a creature exits water after being fully submerged, it usually takes {@dice 2d4} hours for the creature become dry again naturally, or half as long if the creature remains near a source of fire until dry. If a wet creature changes its clothes, it becomes dry immediately.": "当一个生物完全浸泡在水中后离开水体时，通常需要{@dice 2d4}小时生物才能自然变干，如果生物在干燥之前一直靠近火源，时间将缩短一半。如果一个湿漉漉的生物换了衣服，它会立即变干。",
	"Caverns heated by geothermal activity can be quite warm; in fact, hot or severe temperatures are common near volcanoes. Any chamber with exposed magma is severely hot, and will usually exhibit the effects of extreme heat as given in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.": "由地热活动加热的洞穴可能会相当温暖；事实上，在火山附近普遍存在高温或严重的温度。任何暴露岩浆的洞室都会异常炎热，并通常会表现出极端高温的影响，如{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}所述。",
	"Besides its many predatory races and monsters, the Underdark is also home to a variety of animals that live out their lives normally below the ground. These animals include (but are not limited to) bats, crayfish, eyeless cavefish, crickets, flies, gnats, rats, salamanders, spiders, and springfish. Additionally, it is not unusual for creatures in the Upperdark to encounter the occasional raccoon, frog, stray dog, or even lost dwarf, elf, or other representative of a surface race who has accidentally fallen down a deep shaft or well.": "除了许多掠食性种族和怪物外，地底世界还是许多在地下正常生活的动物的家园。这些动物包括（但不限于）蝙蝠，小龙虾，无眼洞穴鱼，蟋蟀，苍蝇，小虫，老鼠，火蜥蜴，蜘蛛和泉鱼。此外，在上层地底世界遇到偶尔的浣熊，青蛙，流浪狗，甚至迷路的矮人，精灵或其他地表种族的代表并不罕见，他们可能是意外掉入深井或洞穴中。",
	"Plants of one kind or another are the beginning of any food chain. By organizing inorganic minerals and capturing the energy of sunlight, plants create food that animals of all kinds depend on. Since plants in the Realms Below do not have access to sunlight, they must make food by other means. Thus, most take very different forms than the green plants of the surface world.": "任何食物链的开始都是某种植物。通过组织无机矿物质并捕获阳光能量，植物创造了各种动物都依赖的食物。由于地下界的植物无法获得阳光，它们必须通过其他方式制造食物。因此，大多数地下界植物的形态与地表世界的绿色植物截然不同。",
	"Most of the Underdark's plant life consists of a tremendous variety of fungi. Fungus normally requires some amount of detritus or decaying material to thrive. So where does the fungus find its food? The answer is simple: magic. The natural magical radiation of the Underdark and its various planar connections support many strange fungal growths, as well as lichens, mosses, and other simple plants, whose existence would otherwise be impossible. In effect, {@i {@variantrule faerzress|JBoE}} is the sunlight of the Realms Below, forming the basis of the subterranean food chain. Underdark regions particularly rich in {@i {@variantrule faerzress|JBoE}} or planar energies have been known to support fantastic forests of pale, gnarled trees or crystalline plants. These growths are completely adapted to their lightless, hostile environment.": "地底世界的植物大多是各种各样的真菌。真菌通常需要一定量的枯落物或腐烂物质才能生长茁壮。那么真菌从哪里获得食物呢？答案很简单：魔法。地底世界自然的魔法辐射以及其各种不同的位面连接支持着许多奇怪的真菌生长，以及地衣、苔藓和其他简单的植物，它们的存在在其他情况下将是不可能的。实际上，{@i {@variantrule faerzress|JBoE} 是下属界的阳光，构成了地下食物链的基础。地底世界中特别富含 {@i {@variantrule faerzress|JBoE} 或位面能量的区域已知能够支持苍白、扭曲的树木或晶体植物构成的奇幻森林。这些生长完全适应了它们无光、恶劣的环境。",
	"Surprisingly, however, green plants are not entirely absent from the Underdark. Some caverns illuminated by particularly bright radiant crystals can actually support green plants. Caves with this sort of dazzling illumination might be filled with grass, moss, ferns, creepers, or even small trees. Any such place is a treasure beyond price in the Underdark, and it is certain to be guarded by deadly spells, monstrous guardians, or both.": "然而，令人惊讶的是，绿色植物并非在地底世界完全不存在。一些被特别明亮的辐射晶体照亮的洞穴实际上可以支持绿色植物。拥有这种令人眼花缭乱照明的洞穴可能充满了草地、苔藓、蕨类植物、攀援植物，甚至小树。在地底世界，任何这样的地方都是无价之宝，肯定会受到致命咒语、怪物守卫或两者的保护。",
	"Stout as a hogshead of ale, the barrelstalk is a large, cask-shaped fungus that grows up to 8 feet in height and 5 feet in diameter. Its outer layers are tough and woody, but its inner flesh is edible, and its center is filled with a reservoir of water (usually from 20 to 50 gallons) that can be tapped and drained. The inner flesh turns black and poisonous when barrelstalk begins producing spores, which happens after ten years of growth.": "像一桶麦酒一样结实，桶菌茎是一种大型、桶状的真菌，可以长到8英尺高，直径达5英尺。它的外层坚韧而木质，但内部肉质可食用，中心充满着一定量的水（通常为20到50加仑），可以开孔排水。当桶菌茎开始产生孢子时，内部肉变黑且有毒，这发生在生长十年后。",
	"The grain of the Underdark, bluecap fungus is inedible to humanoids, but its spores can be ground to make a nutritious, if bland, flour.

	"Thin strands of silvery moss that cling to rock walls, Hair of Eilistraee is not uncommon to find throughout the Underdark, but usually only two or three strands may be found in an area. In some very rare and closely guarded locations, the walls of a tunnel or small cavern may be covered with them. Skilled herbalists who diligently collect or cultivate these strands, or claim a rich source for themselves, can grind the strands into a powder and cook them down into a liquid that can be consumed.

	"The Upperdark's main import from the surface is slaves. Slavers from evil-aligned cities in the Upperdark make frequent forays into the light to capture new slaves for use as either labor or food. They also trade for textiles, grains, fruit, and weapons. Their exports include raw ore, refined metals, gems, and native Underdark plants.": "上暗界（Upperdark）的主要进口品是奴隶。来自上暗界邪恶城市的奴隶贩子经常进入地表，抓捕新的奴隶，用作劳工或食物。他们还进行纺织品、谷物、水果和武器的贸易。他们的出口品包括原矿、精炼金属、宝石和本地地底植物。",
	"Travel in the Upperdark is relatively easy. Multiple paths to a single point usually exist, thanks to millennia of natural processes, volcanic activity, burrowing creatures, and various races cutting trails through the rock. In most places the surrounding earth is composed of rock, but near the surface, tunnels can be hewn out of tightly packed dirt, allowing creatures with burrow speeds that can't cut through rock to blaze their own trails in a pinch.": "在上暗界旅行相对容易。通常存在多条通往同一目的地的路径，这要归功于数千年的自然过程、火山活动、挖掘生物以及各种种族在岩石中开辟道路。在大多数地方，周围的土壤由岩石组成，但靠近地表时，可以从紧密堆积的泥土中凿出隧道，让那些无法穿透岩石的挖掘速度的生物在紧急情况下开辟自己的路径。",
	"{@skill Survival} checks made to hunt, forage, and avoid natural hazards in the Upperdark use the same DCs as normal surface conditions. Basic amenities such as light, air, food, and water are less available in the Upperdark than on the surface, but they are common enough. Luminescent flora and {@i {@variantrule faerzress|JBoE}} provide occasional light, though not consistently enough to allow a creature without {@sense darkvision} to travel without an independent light source. Vents from the surface keep air fresh and moving in the passages, so air quality is rarely an issue. Enormous underground lakes spread across hundreds of miles in some regions, and water trickles down from the surface in many others. Many water sources are guarded or fouled, but quite a few are both clean and open for anyone to use. Many different types of wild fungi are edible, and the Underdark equivalent of small game (rats, dire rats, lizards, and giant vermin) can easily be found in the tunnels. Domesticated animals, such as deep rothé, can also be found near most major population centers.": "{@skill Survival} 在上暗之地进行的狩猎、觅食和避开自然危险的检查使用与正常地表条件相同的 DC。基本设施，如光线、空气、食物和水在上暗之地比地表上少，但它们还是相当普遍的。发光的植物和(`%1%`)偶尔提供光线，尽管不足以让没有(`%2%`)的生物在没有独立光源的情况下行走。来自地表的通风口保持通道中的空气清新流动，因此空气质量很少成为问题。在一些地区，巨大的地下湖泊覆盖了数百英里，而在许多其他地方，水从地表滴落。许多水源受到保护或被污染，但有相当多的水源既干净又对任何人开放。许多不同类型的野生真菌是可食用的，而地下城市中类似小型猎物（老鼠、恐鼠、蜥蜴和巨型害虫）的等价物在隧道中很容易找到。驯养动物，如深色罗斯，也可以在大多数主要人口中心附近找到。",
	"Most Upperdark inhabitants traffic with the surface world in some way, either trading with or raiding their upstairs neighbors for things they can't get in their native habitat. They also trade with (and raid) each other. No Underdark community is ever really friendly with another, but Upperdark settlements often observe wary truces with their neighbors.": "大多数上暗界居民以某种方式与地表世界往来，要么与他们进行贸易，要么抢劫他们楼上的邻居以获取他们在本地无法获得的物品。他们也会相互贸易（和抢劫）。没有任何暗界社区会真正友好地对待另一个，但上暗界定居点通常会与邻居保持警惕的停战状态。",
	"Though they are sometimes considered too small, weak, or fearful to matter, chitines are quite capable of killing those who underestimate them. They are far more clever and malicious than they seem to be—clever enough to avoid fights they're not sure they can win, at the very least.

	"For thousands of years, the great dwarven realms of the surface world have expanded downward instead of outward. Neither gold dwarves nor shield dwarves harbor any fear of the Underdark, and their cities are often buried in the upper reaches of the Realms Below. The kingdom of Iltkazar is the strongest shield dwarf realm remaining in the Underdark, and the gold dwarves there retain extensive Underdark holdings in the vicinity of the Great Rift. Unlike the duergar, who prefer the deeper portions of the Underdark, gold and shield dwarves keep fields and livestock on the surface and trade extensively with surface folk. These dwarves are gifted engineers and industrious workers, and they have built many roads and bridges in the Underdark.": "数千年来，地表世界上伟大的矮人王国一直向下扩张，而不是向外扩展。金矮人和盾矮人都不怕地下世界，他们的城市常常隐藏在地下世界的上层。伊尔卡扎尔王国是地下世界中最强大的盾矮人王国，那里的金矮人在大裂谷附近保留了广泛的地下世界领地。与更喜欢地下世界深处的灰矮人不同，金矮人和盾矮人在地表上种植农田、饲养牲畜，并与地表居民进行广泛贸易。这些矮人是有天赋的工程师和勤劳的工人，他们在地下世界建造了许多道路和桥梁。",
	"Bugbears, goblins, and hobgoblins often establish outposts and settlements in the Upperdark, from which they can easily raid nearby surface lands. Goblinoids may in fact be the most numerous of the Underdark's races, but they have raised no great cities and delved no great caverns. Most goblinoid tribes exist in a state of barbaric squalor. Goblins in particular are commonly found as slaves in the cities of crueler and more sophisticated races, such as the udadrow and the duergar.": "大蜘蛛兽(`Bugbears`), 哥布林(`goblins`), 和霍布戈布林(`hobgoblins`)经常在上暗域(`Upperdark`)建立前哨站和定居点，从那里他们可以轻易袭击附近的地表土地。哥布林族群实际上可能是地下世界(`Underdark`)中最众多的种族，但他们没有建立过伟大的城市，也没有挖掘过巨大的洞穴。大多数哥布林族群存在于野蛮肮脏的状态中。特别是哥布林经常被发现作为奴隶存在于更残忍和更复杂种族的城市中，比如乌达德罗(`udadrow`)和杜尔加(`duergar`)。",
	"These so-called deepbears frequently band together to raid and forage throughout the Underdark. They once had a kingdom, Ursadunthar, deep beneath the Spine of the World, but it fell to the duergar of Gracklstugh in-1350 DR. Most quaggoth bands now survive by roaming the deeps as nomadic hunter-gatherers and supplementing their diets with anything (or anyone) that falls into their bloody claws. Like goblins, quaggoths are frequently encountered as slaves in the cities of more civilized Underdark denizens, such as udadrow.": "这些所谓的深熊经常聚集在一起，在地下世界中进行掠夺和觅食。它们曾经在世界脊下的深处拥有一个王国，乌萨登萨尔(Ursadunthar)，但在-1350年，它被格拉克斯图的杜尔加尔(duergar)所摧毁。现在，大多数獾人(quaggoth)部落通过在深处漫游，作为游牧猎人-采集者生存，并用任何掉入它们血腥爪子中的东西（或任何人）来补充它们的饮食。像地精一样，獾人经常被发现作为奴隶出现在更文明的地下城市居民中，比如乌达德罗(udadrow)。",
	"Hulking and fierce minotaurs dwell in the Upperdark, usually favoring the most confusing and complex cave systems for their lairs. Minotaurs generally live by raiding and plunder, although more than a few sell their services to other folk who offer gold and food in exchange for a chance to fight. Minotaurs are kept as slaves by Upperdark dwellers such as udadrow and mind flayers, but such slaves are not numerous. The vast delve known as the Labyrinth was once a minotaur empire of sorts. While no signs of the former minotaur civilization remain, thousands of the creatures still infest the area.": "庞大而凶猛的牛头怪居住在上暗域，通常偏爱最令人困惑和复杂的洞穴系统作为它们的巢穴。牛头怪通常以抢劫和掠夺为生，尽管有不少牛头怪会出售自己的服务给其他愿意提供金币和食物换取战斗机会的人。牛头怪被上暗域居民如乌达德罗(udadrow)和控脑食人魔(mind flayers)作为奴隶，但这样的奴隶并不多见。被称为迷宫的广阔挖掘区曾经是一种牛头怪帝国。虽然没有前牛头怪文明的迹象，但仍有成千上万的这种生物滋生在这一地区。",
	"Like goblins, orcs often settle in the upper caverns of the Underdark. Caverns close to the surface offer shelter from the hated sun and easy defensibility with a minimum of work, and most orcs are only too happy to take advantage of that combination. Orcs are often enslaved by deeper-dwelling races, so they can be found almost anywhere in the Underdark.": "与地底世界的地精一样，半兽人经常定居在地底深处的上层洞穴中。靠近地表的洞穴为他们提供了避开令他们厌恶的阳光的庇护所，并且只需最少的工作就能轻松防御，大多数半兽人都乐意利用这种组合。半兽人经常被深层种族奴役，因此在地底世界几乎到处都可以找到他们。",
	"The deep gnomes live in hidden caves and secretive strongholds throughout all three layers of the Underdark, but most of them dwell in the Upperdark and Middledark. Deep gnomes avoid trouble by simply staying well clear of it, and few strangers ever blunder across svirfneblin towns. The svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone fell recently to a demonspawned udadrow assault.": "深地侏儒生活在地下世界的三个层次中的隐藏洞穴和秘密据点中，但大多数居住在上深地和中深地。深地侏儒通过简单地远离麻烦来避免问题，很少有陌生人会闯入斯维弗内布林（(Svirfneblin)）城镇。斯维弗内布林城市布林登斯通（(Blingdenstone)）最近被一个由恶魔产生的乌达德洛（udadrow）突袭所摧毁。",
	"Powerful and ponderous in action and thought, stone giants are strong enough to keep all but the most magically powerful of foes at bay. These creatures delve enormous quarries for their homes, and they can work wonders with their chosen medium. Few in number, stone giants leave other folk alone and expect the same courtesy from anyone passing through their lands. The most powerful stone giant realm is the kingdom of Cairnheim, beneath the Giant's Run Mountains.": "行动和思考强大而沉重，石巨人足够强大，可以阻挡除了最具魔法力量的敌人之外的所有敌人。这些生物在他们的家园中开采巨大的采石场，他们可以用他们选择的媒介创造奇迹。石巨人数量稀少，他们不会打扰其他民族，也期望任何路过他们领土的人给予同样的礼貌。最强大的石巨人王国是位于巨人之奔山下的凯恩海姆王国。",
	"Perhaps no other race is as universally detested as the troglodytes. These bloodthirsty savages descend on the realms of other Underdark folk like a plague of locusts and immediately set about raiding, pillaging, and killing anyone unfortunate enough to be nearby. They occasionally serve as slaves to more powerful races, but only in those places where more tractable (and less vile) slaves aren't widely available. Troglodytes were once much more widespread in the Underdark than they are now, but they have been rooted out and exterminated in many places. Most troglodytes now live in the southern portions of the Underdark, particularly beneath the Mhair and Black Jungles.": "也许没有其他种族像穴居人那样普遍地被人憎恶。这些嗜血的野蛮人如同蝗虫一般侵袭其他地底生物的领地，立即展开抢劫、掠夺和杀戮，不幸附近的任何人都会遭殃。他们偶尔会作为更强大种族的奴隶，但只有在更易驾驭（且不那么邪恶）的奴隶不易获得的地方。穴居人曾经比现在更广泛地分布在地底世界，但在许多地方已经被根除和消灭。大多数穴居人现在生活在地底世界的南部地区，尤其是在梅尔（Mhair）和黑暗（Black）丛林下方。",
	"The Middledark lies between 3 and 10 miles beneath the surface of Faerûn. Larger cities of udadrow and duergar are in the Middledark. Other inhabitants include lone aboleths, cloakers, derro, grimlocks, and kuo-toas. A few mind flayer outposts are scattered throughout this level as well.": "中暗位于费伦大陆地表下3到10英里。中暗中有较大的乌达德洛城市和矮人城市。其他居民包括孤立的食脑鱼、隐形兽、德洛、格里姆洛克和深渊鱼人。此层中也分布着一些思想吞噬者前哨站。",
	"Settled communities in the Middledark commonly send trade caravans and raiding parties to the surface, or at least up to Upperdark trading centers such as Menzoberranzan and Ooltul. Visitors from the surface are rare and tend to be viewed as potential slaves or food. Caravan travel brings mostly luxuries; staples must be grown locally.": "在Middledark，定居社区通常会派遣贸易商队和掠夺队到地表，或者至少到像门宗贝兰赞(`Menzoberranzan`)和乌图尔(`Ooltul`)这样的Upperdark贸易中心。来自地表的访客很少，往往被视为潜在的奴隶或食物。商队旅行主要带来奢侈品；主食必须在当地种植。",
	"Travel in the Middledark can be difficult. In many cases, it's simply not possible to go from one place to another because no caves or tunnels lead in the right direction. To overcome this drawback, many of the races that dwell at this depth are prolific portal builders and tunnelers.": "在中暗地旅行可能会很困难。在许多情况下，由于没有洞穴或隧道通向正确的方向，从一个地方到另一个地方根本不可能。为了克服这一缺点，许多居住在这个深度的种族是多产的传送门建造者和隧道挖掘者。",
	"The Middledark is, at its best, worse than the harshest surface deserts. The DC for any Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check made in the Middledark automatically increases by 5, even for natives. Wild resources are hard to find, and most of those that do exist have already been placed under guard by someone else.": "在最好的时候，中暗((Middledark))比最严酷的地表沙漠还要糟糕。在中暗中进行的任何智力检定的 DC 自动增加 5 点，即使对于当地居民也是如此。野外资源很难找到，而且大部分已经被其他人守卫起来。",
	"Glowing fungi and lichens are less common at this depth than they are in the Upperdark. They can be easily cultivated, but most concentrations of them appear in cities, not in the wild. Air tends to be stale, but breathable, though poisonous fumes choke out normal air in a few areas. In many places, water is scarce, and any large supply is well guarded. Creatures living at this depth get most or all of their water from the fluids in other creatures they eat. Food is the most plentiful of the necessities at this depth, but even that becomes an issue at the lower end of the depth range.": "在这个深度，发光的真菌和地衣比在上暗深度更不常见。它们可以很容易地被栽培，但大多数浓度出现在城市中，而不是在野外。空气往往是污浊的，但可以呼吸，尽管有些地区有有毒气体会排出正常空气。在许多地方，水很稀缺，任何大量供应都受到严密保护。生活在这个深度的生物大多或全部从它们所吃的其他生物的体液中获取水分。食物是这个深度最丰富的必需品，但即使在深度范围的较低端，这也会成为一个问题。",
	"No alliance is permanent in the Middledark.": "在中暗界(Middledark)中，没有任何联盟是永久的。",
	"Some communities maintain wary trading partnerships with others, but it is understood that if one party ever grows stronger than the other, the terms of the partnership will change—perhaps drastically. Even in the most open of Middledark cities, newcomers can expect to be challenged (physically or otherwise) unless they make a pointed display of power upon entry.": "一些社区与其他社区保持谨慎的贸易伙伴关系，但人们普遍认为，如果一方变得比另一方更强大，伙伴关系的条件将会改变——也许会发生巨大的变化。即使在最开放的（Middledark）城市中，新来者也可以期待在进入时受到挑战（无论是身体上还是其他方面），除非他们在进入时展示出明显的权力。",
	"Most udadrow cities occupy large vaults or caverns in the Middledark. At these depths, {@i {@variantrule faerzress|JBoE}} is common and powerful, and the dark elves have developed many potent spells and defenses that harness the Underdark's magical radiation for their own purposes. The Middledark also offers the defense of distance—a udadrow outpost near the surface is vulnerable to the attacks of adventurers and surface elves, but moving a large army into the Middledark can't be done with ease.": "大多数乌达德罗（Udadrow）城市占据了中暗界（Middledark）的大型地窖或洞穴。在这些深处，{@i {@variantrule faerzress|JBoE} 是常见且强大的，黑暗精灵已经开发出许多强大的法术和防御措施，利用地下世界的魔法辐射来为自己谋利。中暗界还提供了距离防御——靠近地表的乌达德罗前哨站容易受到冒险者和地表精灵的攻击，但要将大军移动到中暗界却并非易事。",
	"Taken as a whole, udadrow probably have the most significant presence in the Middledark. Their cities and strongholds are numerous, wealthy, and well situated for defense, and the udadrow themselves are cruel and strong. Only the endless feuding of the great Houses constrains udadrow power. Menzoberranzan is the most famous of udadrow cities.": "总的来说，乌达德罗(udadrow)可能在中暗界(Middledark)拥有最显著的存在。他们的城市和要塞众多，富裕，并且位置优越以防御，而乌达德罗本身残忍而强大。只有伟大家族之间无休止的争斗限制了乌达德罗的力量。门宗贝兰赞(Menzoberranzan)是最著名的乌达德罗城市。",
	"The Middledark is also home to the largest and most powerful gray dwarf realms. The duergar have no particular use for {@i {@variantrule faerzress|JBoE}} and do not worry about agesold vendettas against the surface world; they came down to the Middledark because the lower one descends into the earth, the more rare and wondrous the minerals that one can find. If the Lowerdark were not so completely inhospitable, the gray dwarves would pursue their veins of ore and gemstones all the way to the roots of the world, but lower reaches of the Middledark represent the deepest depth at which large cities can be easily sustained. Duergar cities are less numerous than those of the udadrow, but any given gray dwarf city is likely to be a strong, wealthy, and martially inclined realm quite powerful enough to deter the attacks of its hostile neighbors. The cities of Dunspeirrin and Gracklstugh are good examples of duergar realms.": "Middledark（中暗）也是最大和最强大的灰暗矮人领地所在。灰暗矮人对{@i {@variantrule faerzress|JBoE}没有特别的用途，也不会担心与地表世界的长期仇恨；他们来到中暗是因为往地底深处探索，就能发现更加稀有和奇妙的矿物。如果下暗界（Lowerdark）不是如此完全不适宜居住，灰暗矮人会一直追寻矿脉和宝石，一直到世界的根部。但中暗的较低区域代表着可以轻松维持大城市的最深深度。与乌达德罗（udadrow）相比，灰暗矮人的城市数量较少，但任何一个灰暗矮人城市很可能是一个强大、富裕和好战的领地，足以抵御敌对邻国的攻击。邓斯佩林（Dunspeirrin）和格拉克斯图（Gracklstugh）是灰暗矮人领地的典型例子。",
	"The most hideous and wicked of giantkind, the terrible fomorians dwell throughout the Underdark, but mostly in the middle section. They are thankfully scarce, and no one knows of any true fomorian cities of holdings in the Realms Below. However, a few dozen fomorians gathered in a keep or clanhold represent a formidable threat to their neighbors.": "最丑陋和邪恶的巨人种族，可怕的(`fomorians`)居住在地下世界，但主要是在中部地区。幸运的是，它们并不常见，没有人知道在地下王国中是否存在真正的(`fomorian`)城市或领地。然而，几十个(`fomorians`)聚集在一个要塞或氏族堡垒中，对他们的邻居构成了强大的威胁。",
	"Monstrous and alien, grells are usually thought of as solitary predators, but in the Underdark they have been known to gather in nests or hives numbering dozens of individuals. In settlements of this size, grells divide themselves into distinct castes, including a philosopher caste whose members boast potent abilities as psions or sorcerers. Grells make poor neighbors, since they regard all other creatures only as potential prey.": "巨大而外星的，格雷尔(grells)通常被认为是孤独的猎食者，但在地底世界(Underdark)中，它们已知会聚集成数十个个体的巢穴或蜂巢。在这种规模的聚居地中，格雷尔会划分为不同的种姓，包括一个哲学家种姓，其成员拥有强大的超能力，如感应者或巫师。格雷尔并不是好邻居，因为它们把其他所有生物都视为潜在的猎物。",
	"Well suited for a life in the lightless depths, grimlocks gather in large, savage tribes that are fully capable of overwhelming the cities and strongholds of more sophisticated races. Grimlocks are tireless hunters and raiders, and they often range dozens of miles from their lairs in search of food and plunder. Like the goblins and orcs of the higher levels, grimlocks are frequently enslaved by other races (particularly mind flayers) and can be found almost anywhere. The grimlocks long ago laid claim to the cavern complex called Fingerhome. Within it, the village of Reeshov is a good example of a community of free grimlocks, as is the Cavern of Cloven Heads, which is home to the twisted descendants of the Golden Eagle and Red Pony Uthgardt tribes.": "适合生活在无光深处的格里姆洛克人，聚集成大型、凶猛的部落，完全有能力压倒更复杂种族的城市和要塞。格里姆洛克人是不知疲倦的猎手和劫掠者，他们经常在数十英里外的地方四处寻找食物和掠夺。与高层次的地精和兽人一样，格里姆洛克人经常被其他种族（尤其是心灵食者）奴役，几乎可以在任何地方找到他们。格里姆洛克人很久以前就宣称对指环之家这个洞穴群落拥有所有权。在其中，里绍夫村是一个自由格里姆洛克人社区的典范，克洛文头颅洞穴则是金鹰和红马乌斯加特部落扭曲后代的家园。",
	"These vile abominations plague many of the Middledark's lonely and deserted passages, waylaying any travelers who come along. Hook horrors seem barely sentient, but they have been known to gather in large and dangerous bands to stake out a good source of water or a cavern of edible fungus as their own.": "这些邪恶的可怕生物困扰着许多中暗地的孤寂和荒废通道，伏击任何经过的旅行者。（Hook horrors）似乎几乎没有智慧，但已知它们会聚集成大而危险的群体，以占据一处良好的水源或可食用真菌的洞穴。",
	"Kuo-toas are found throughout the seas of the Middledark. This once great race has dwindled over time, and many of kuotoan cities lie in ruins. The worship of the Sea Mother is all-important in kuo-toan society, and kuo-toa clerics and monks wield virtually unchallenged power over the rest of the race. Kuo-toas get along reasonably well with most other Underdark races (except aboleths), and they travel widely as traders, pilgrims, and guides.": "在Middledark的海域中可以找到许多Kuo-toas。这个曾经伟大的种族随着时间的推移而减少，许多Kuotoan城市已经荒废。在Kuo-toan社会中，对海之母的崇拜至关重要，Kuo-toa的牧师和僧侣几乎无人能敌地掌握着对种族其他成员的权力。Kuo-toas与大多数其他地下种族（除了Aboleths）相处得相当不错，并且作为贸易商、朝圣者和向导广泛旅行。",
	"The strongest kuo-toan city remaining in Faerûn's Underdark is Sloopdilmonpolop, which lies in Old Shanatar. Kuo-toas generally keep to the saltwater seas of the Underdark, leaving the freshwater lakes to the aboleths.": "在法罗的地底世界中，最强大的葵托人城市是斯卢普迪尔蒙波洛普（Sloopdilmonpolop），位于古夏纳塔尔（Old Shanatar）。葵托人通常居住在地底世界的盐水海域，将淡水湖泊留给了食人鱼（aboleths）。",
	"Like the stone giants or fomorians, maurs are not common, but where they walk, lesser folk get out of the way. Descendants of storm giants that were imprisoned deep in the earth long ago for some forgotten crime, maurs are unusual among Middledark races in that they are not malicious, predatory slaveholders. Some maurs are as wicked as any fomorian, of course, but for the most part, these ruined giants want nothing more than to be left alone by their neighbors.": "像石巨人或(福莫瑞安)(fomorians)一样，(莫尔)(maurs)并不常见，但在它们行走的地方，次要的人会让路。作为风暴巨人的后代，它们很久以前因为某种被遗忘的罪行而被囚禁在地底深处，(莫尔)在中暗界种族中是不寻常的，因为它们并不是恶意的、掠夺性的奴隶主。当然，有些(莫尔)像(福莫瑞安)一样邪恶，但大多数这些被毁灭的巨人只是希望被邻居们放过，什么都不想要。",
	"After the udadrow, the mind flayers are probably the most powerful, notorious, and sinister of the Underdark's peoples. Illithid cities tend to be quite small by the standards of other races—few of them number more than 500 mind flayers. However, since illithids are uniquely well suited to hold great numbers of slaves and thralls, mind flayer cities may have ten times as many slaves as illithids. Unlike the slaves of the udadrow or duergar, illithid thralls are compelled to absolute loyalty and zeal in the service of their horrid masters. The mind flayers can field entire armies of thralls whenever they wish and hurl them into battle without concern for their loyalty or fighting spirit. The mind flayers prefer the lower reaches of the Middledark, but they also have numerous communities in the Lowerdark. The mighty city of Oryndoll is the most famous of their realms.": "在乌达德罗之后，触须食脑者可能是地下城最强大、臭名昭著和邪恶的种族。伊利希德城市通常按其他种族的标准来说相当小，很少有超过500个触须食脑者。然而，由于触须食脑者独特地适合拥有大量奴隶和奴仆，触须食脑者城市可能有十倍于触须食脑者数量的奴隶。与乌达德罗或杜尔加的奴隶不同，伊利希德的奴仆被迫绝对忠诚和热忱地为他们可怕的主人服务。触须食脑者可以随时动用整个军队的奴隶，并将他们投入战斗，而不用担心他们的忠诚或战斗精神。触须食脑者更喜欢中暗域的下层，但他们也在下暗域有许多社区。玛瑞多尔这座强大的城市是他们领地中最著名的。",
	"Stronger, smarter, and more advanced than their surface kin, the deep orcs are well suited for the fierce competition of the Underdark. Orog cities are not numerous, but they can be found throughout the northerly reaches of the Underdark, from the Spine of the World all the way to the Icerim Mountains. Orogs favor volcanic regions, so they tend to found their cities in torrid caverns too hostile for creatures without fire resistance to endure.": "比起他们地表的同类，深地半兽人更强壮、更聪明、更先进。他们很适合在地下世界的激烈竞争中生存。半兽人城市并不多，但它们遍布地下世界的北部地区，从世界之脊一直延伸到冰冠山脉。半兽人偏爱火山地区，因此他们倾向于在炎热的洞穴中建立城市，这对于没有火焰抗性的生物来说是无法忍受的。",
	"Although umber hulks are sentient, they are nomadic hunters that build no cities and manufacture no tools. Their claws and mandibles are more than sufficient for their purposes. Among the most common of the Underdark's monsters, umber hulks fearlessly attack almost anything they meet, relying on their confusing gaze to scatter or paralyze most of their foes.": "虽然赭石巨蚁是有智慧的，它们是游牧猎手，不建立城市，也不制造工具。它们的爪子和大颚已经足够满足它们的需求。作为地底世界最常见的怪物之一，赭石巨蚁毫不畏惧地攻击几乎所有遇到的东西，依靠其混乱凝视来驱散或麻痹大多数敌人。",
	"No place on Toril is as strange and dangerous as the Lowerdark. This level of the Underdark extends from 10 miles below the surface to unfathomable depths and features a degree of strangeness that would drive some surface dwellers insane. Few upper-worlders ever descend to the Lowerdark, and few of the Lowerdark's denizens want anything to do with the surface world. Some of the creatures in the Lowerdark—intelligent or otherwise—aren't even aware of a surface world; others have heard of it but consider it a mythical place.": "在托瑞尔（Toril）上没有任何地方像下暗界（Lowerdark）那样奇怪和危险。这个地下世界的层次从地表以下10英里延伸到难以想象的深度，充满了让一些地表居民发疯的怪异现象。很少有上层世界的人下到下暗界，而下暗界的居民也很少想与地表世界有任何关系。下暗界的一些生物——无论是有智慧还是其他——甚至不知道地表世界的存在；另一些听说过地表世界，但认为那是一个神话般的地方。",
	"Interspecies and intraspecies strife is the rule in the Underdark. Resources are minimal, and weakness invites extermination. Most of the Lowerdark's denizens are chaotic, evil, or both. Even the vermin and animals encountered in this area are rarely ordinary—many have been transfigured by crossbreeding or magical interference. Nothing here is normal or simple.": "在地底世界，种间和种内冲突是常规。资源稀缺，弱点会招致灭绝。大多数地底深处的居民都是混乱、邪恶或两者兼具。即使是在这个地区遇到的害虫和动物也很少是普通的——许多都经过了杂交或魔法干预而被改变。在这里，没有什么是正常或简单的。",
	"Travel in the Lowerdark is arduous at best. The term Lower Underdark actually refers to many places, since the great domains of Faerûn's Underdark possess fewer and fewer interconnections the deeper one delves. Only about a third of the lowest sections of the Underdark actually connect to each other. The rest of the Lowerdark consists of isolated pockets of space reachable only from the Middledark, by water, or by transportation magic.": "在最好的情况下，穿越下暗界是艰难的。实际上，“下暗界”这个术语指的是许多地方，因为法术辽阔的暗界领域越深入，相互连接的通道就越少。只有大约三分之一的最低层暗界部分实际上相互连接。下暗界的其余部分由孤立的空间口袋组成，只能从中暗界、通过水路或通过传送魔法到达。",
	"Typically only one route exists to any given point, and that is what must be used unless the traveler plans to dig one. Though time consuming and cumbersome, many adventurers find it expedient to do just that, so they keep the necessary magic items and spells handy to make their own tunnels as needed. Fortunately, {@i {@variantrule faerzress|JBoE}} is rare at this depth, so teleportation can be used to travel the Lowerdark with a reasonable hope of success, assuming that the traveler has a good sense of the destination.": "通常到达任何给定点只有一条路线，除非旅行者打算挖掘一条新路。尽管耗时且繁琐，许多冒险者发现这样做是方便的，因此他们随身携带必要的魔法物品和法术，以便根据需要开辟自己的隧道。幸运的是，在这个深度，{@i {@variantrule faerzress|JBoE}很少见，因此可以使用传送术来在较为合理的成功希望下穿越下暗界，前提是旅行者对目的地有很好的认识。",
	"The Lowerdark is a strange realm warped by severe environmental and magical forces. The problems that pervade the rest of the Underdark intensify here. Resources are scarce, and control of them is continually contested. Air does filter down this far, but it is frequently stale and occasionally toxic because of geothermal fumes. Water is virtually nonexistent, and the little that is present is well guarded. Food cannot be found in the wild, unless the hunter has no aversion to cannibalism. (Many creatures at this depth survive by this means.) The Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check DCs for most tasks increase by 10. Exacerbating these problems still further are numerous areas of wild magic and dead magic. Though {@i {@variantrule faerzress|JBoE}} is rare here, the Weave in the Lowerdark is a snarled, tangled mess. Yet another magic-complicating feature is a high degree of portal seepage (see Magical Phenomena).": "下暗域是一个受严重环境和魔法力量扭曲的奇怪领域。困扰地下世界其他地区的问题在这里变得更加严重。资源稀缺，对资源的控制不断受到争夺。空气虽然能够流通到这么深的地方，但常常变得陈旧，有时因地热气体而具有毒性。水几乎不存在，少量存在的水源也受到严密保护。食物在野外几乎找不到，除非猎人不排斥食人。 (许多生物在这个深度通过这种方式生存。) 大多数任务的智慧检定 DC 值增加 10 点。更加恶化这些问题的是许多区域存在着狂野魔法和死亡魔法。虽然 {@i {@variantrule faerzress|JBoE} 在这里很少见，下暗域中的魔纹却错综复杂。另一个增加魔法复杂性的特征是高度的传送门渗漏 (见魔法现象)。",
	"The darkness at this depth is so deep that it seems to actively dislike light. Natural light sources fail with unnerving frequency, and magical light sources draw attackers like flies to rotten fruit. In some places, the shadows cast in areas of light are unnatural—too large or too small for the light source, or cast in contradictory angles. Even beings with {@sense darkvision} see a flickering of dark around the edges of their vision, as if the darkness were trying to smother out any sight at all.": "在这个深度，黑暗是如此深邃，以至于似乎主动厌恶光线。自然光源频繁地失效，而魔法光源则像苍蝇被腐烂水果吸引一样吸引攻击者。在某些地方，光线照射的阴影是不自然的——太大或太小，与光源投射的角度相矛盾。即使拥有{@sense darkvision}的存在，也会在视野边缘看到黑暗在闪烁，仿佛黑暗正在试图扼杀任何视觉。",
	"Why would any creature with intelligence or common sense live in such a terrible environment? Some races have lived here for generation upon generation, and the Lowerdark is simply their home. Other creatures settle here to take advantage of the Lowerdark's unique magical properties, rare ores, or shelter from the hated sun. Still others view a sojourn in the Lowerdark as a temporary solution, since the dead magic areas and hostile territory may be a wanted criminal's most expedient means of avoiding capture.": "为什么会有任何有智慧或常识的生物会选择生活在如此恶劣的环境中呢？有些种族已经在这里生活了许多代，对他们来说，地下深渊(Lowerdark)就是他们的家园。其他生物选择在这里定居是为了利用地下深渊独特的魔法特性、稀有矿石，或是躲避讨厌的阳光。还有一些人则将在地下深渊逗留视为一种临时解决方案，因为那里的死亡魔法区域和敌对领土可能是一个通缉犯最快捷地避免被捕的方法。",
	"Of course, not everyone is in the Lowerdark by choice. Some unfortunates are here because they neglected to research the destinations of the portals through which they ventured. Others have been exiled here from communities in the Middledark, the Upperdark, or even the surface world. Some udadrow matrons get rid of potentially problematic subordinates by sending them on exploratory or expansionistic raiding parties into the Lowerdark. A triumphant scout returning from the mission into the depths might find her unexpected survival fatally inconvenient to the matron who dispatched her.": "当然，并非所有人都是自愿进入下暗界的。一些不幸的人之所以在这里，是因为他们没有研究他们冒险穿越的传送门的目的地。其他人被流放到这里，可能是来自中暗界、上暗界，甚至地表世界的社区。一些乌达德罗（Udadrow）女族长通过派遣下属参加探险或扩张性的袭击队来摆脱潜在问题。一位从深处任务归来的得意侦察员可能会发现她意外的生还对派遣她的女族长来说是致命的不便。",
	"Several Middledark races make frequent forays into the Lowerdark. Some do so because of expansionistic desires, others because they need the resources, and a scant few because they have something to prove. Grimlocks and orogs often set a coming-ofage trial for their young warriors to mark the passage between adolescence and adulthood. In a typical version of such a trial, the youth is sent into the Lowerdark, sometimes armed only with a dagger, and told to return with a trophy demonstrating his competence and ability to contribute to the community.": "一些中暗族群经常进入下暗地。一些是因为扩张欲望，另一些是因为他们需要资源，还有少数是因为他们有什么要证明的。格里姆洛克和奥罗格经常为他们的年轻战士设定成年仪式，标志着从青少年到成年的过渡。在这样一个典型的试炼中，年轻人被送入下暗地，有时只带着一把匕首，并被告知带回一个证明他能力和贡献社区的奖品。",
	"These horrible aberrations lurk in the deepest, blackest waters of the Underdark, surrounded by legions of thralls. Gifted with extraordinary intelligence and powerful magical abilities, the aboleths are the unquestioned masters of most Lowerdark lakes and seas. While some aboleth cities are quite large, small outposts (or \"broodholds\") of a dozen or so outposts are much more common.": "这些可怕的畸变生物潜伏在地底深处、最黑暗的水域中，周围围绕着无数的奴隶。拥有非凡的智慧和强大的魔法能力，阿波立斯是大多数地底湖泊和海洋中无可争议的主宰。虽然一些阿波立斯城市相当庞大，但规模较小的前哨基地（或“孵化地”）更为常见，每个基地大约有十几个。",
	"Thankfully few in number, the avolokias are master necromancers and shapechangers. In its true form, an avolakia is a 10-foot monstrosity combining insectile, octopoid, and wormlike features. Devoted to the elevation of deities of decay and undeath (including Ghaunadaur and Velsharoon, among others), an avolokia nest is surrounded by a shambling army of undead under the monsters' control.
