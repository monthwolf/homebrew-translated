	"The Dungeon Master's Guide provides three example disease to use in a D&D game which are simple to implement and easy to adapt to suit one's individual needs, but lack complexity or versatility. The diseases described below delve deeper into what a fantasy disease can be, and how it can be implemented into a story or campaign.": "《地牢主指南》提供了三个示例疾病，可用于D&D游戏中，这些疾病易于实施，也易于根据个人需求进行调整，但缺乏复杂性或多样性。下面描述的疾病更深入探讨了幻想疾病的本质，以及如何将其融入故事或冒险中。",
	"While the Medicine skill is always useful when dealing with diseases, some focus has been given to alternative skills to use when diagnosing or treating these diseases. Typically in D&D a disease can be cured easily with magic at relatively low levels. In the examples below, the methods of treated are more difficulty or require additional steps to make the usual remedies effective, not only to make these conditions more dangerous to parties with easy access to disease-curing magic, but also to evoke the tense and dramatic process that medicine can often be in fiction.": "在处理疾病时，医药技能总是非常有用的，但一些替代技能也被用来诊断或治疗这些疾病。在D&D中，通常可以很容易地用魔法治愈疾病，尤其是在较低级别时。在下面的例子中，治疗方法更加困难，或需要额外的步骤才能使通常的疗法有效，这不仅是为了让那些可以轻松治愈疾病的魔法对于这些情况更加危险，还是为了唤起医学在小说中经常呈现的紧张和戏剧性过程。",
	"In addition, some of these entries serve multiple purposes rather than simply being negative stat penalties to apply to players. For example, applying Blightpus to a horde of weak enemies can make them more dangerous to cleave through in close quarters, while Shroud Vine confers both penalties and desirable boons to those infected. At the end of this section are roll tables of plot hooks for each listed disease to use as inspiration for stories involving them.": "此外，一些条目不仅仅是对玩家施加负面属性惩罚，而是具有多重作用。例如，将枯萎脓液应用于一群弱小敌人可能会使它们在近距离格斗中更加危险，而幽影藤蔓既施加惩罚又给受感染者带来理想的好处。在本节的最后，列出了每种疾病的情节钩子投掷表，可用作涉及这些疾病的故事灵感。",
	" Each disease subheading is divided into the following parts:": "每个疾病子标题分为以下几个部分：",
	" First the entry gives the most common name for the disease, but some disease may be known by multiple names or have a different name in other settings.": "首先，该条目提供了疾病的最常见名称，但有些疾病可能会有多个名称，或在其他环境中有不同的名称。",
	" {@b Symptoms} describes the visible effects of the disease to an outside observer as well as what an infected creature might feel or be aware of.": "{@b Symptoms}描述了疾病对外界观察者的可见影响，以及感染生物可能感受到或意识到的事情。",
	" {@b Effects} details the effects of the disease in game terms and how it affects an infected creature's in-game statistics.": "{@b Effects}详细描述了疾病在游戏术语中的影响，以及它如何影响感染生物的游戏统计数据。",
	" {@b Contracting} outlines how a creature becomes infected in game terms, as well as an overview of situations where one is likely to come into contact with the disease.": "{@b Contracting}概述了在游戏术语中生物如何被感染，以及可能接触到这种疾病的情况概述。",
	" {@b Diagnosis} gives suggestions on ability checks one could use to identify the disease or gain more information about it.": "{@b Diagnosis}提供了关于能力检定的建议，可以用来识别疾病或获取更多相关信息。",
	" {@b Treatment} describes how to cure the disease or how to alleviate some of its effects in game terms.": "{@b Treatment}描述了如何在游戏中治愈疾病或减轻其一些影响。",
	"In the magical worlds of D&D, healing disease is simple and can be done with a single spell. Many large towns and cities have divine spellcasters available, and smaller settlements can call for aid. Wilderness and tribal communities may have druids in their ranks who are also competent healers. With healing magic everywhere, how does an outbreak of disease even happen? How can you run exciting and horrifying stories of plague-ridden lands when by all rights this should be a trivial matter to resolve?": "在D&D的魔法世界中，治愈疾病是简单的，可以用一个法术完成。许多大城镇和城市都有神圣法术施法者，而较小的定居点可以请求援助。荒野和部落社区可能有德鲁伊，他们也是有能力的治疗者。既然治疗魔法随处可见，为什么还会发生疾病爆发？在所有权利的情况下，这应该是一个微不足道的问题，如何运行令人兴奋和可怕的瘟疫肆虐的土地故事？",
	"The solution used for many of the diseases presented in this document is to simply make some of the diseases themselves more difficult to heal. But this may not work for your story. Perhaps you want the disease to be an integral part of the setting, but not something the players need to worry about for long, since the real-life countermeasures against disease spread such as staying at home aren't condusive to adventure. Or perhaps you simply don't want to have the hassle of repeatedly running complex cures that will slow down the pace of the game. In situations like this, the formal rules and their streamlined cures might work for you, but creates a problem when trying to explain why everyone can't do this. There are other possible explanations though:": "这份文件中提出的许多疾病的解决方案是简单地使其中一些疾病本身更难治愈。但这种方法可能不适用于你的故事。也许你希望这种疾病成为环境的一个重要组成部分，但不是玩家需要长时间担心的事情，因为现实生活中防止疾病传播的措施，如呆在家里，并不利于冒险。或者你可能只是不想要反复运行复杂的治疗方法，这会减慢游戏的节奏。在这种情况下，正式规则及其简化的治疗方法可能适合你，但在尝试解释为什么每个人都不能这样做时会产生问题。不过，还有其他可能的解释：",
	"The affected settlement is isolated and healers can't reach it, or the locals can't easily leave to call for aid.": "受影响的定居点被孤立起来，治疗师无法抵达，当地居民也难以轻易离开寻求援助。",
	"There are healers available, but not enough. They are being overwhelmed by the patient load, or the infection is simply too widespread to stop.": "有治疗者可用，但数量不足。他们被患者负荷压倒，或者感染已经蔓延得太广，无法阻止。",
	"Political, religious, or racial divides means that certain demographics aren't being treated or are at a lower priority for recieving treatment.": "政治、宗教或种族分歧意味着某些人口群体在接受治疗方面没有得到公平对待，或者处于较低的优先级。",
	"Healers are split between treating this outbreak and providing aid for some other event, such as a war or natural disaster.": "治疗者们被分散在对抗这场疫情和为其他事件（如战争或自然灾害）提供援助之间。",
	"Healers are handling individual cases but can't address the underlying cause of the outbreak, such as contaminated water, biological warfare, attacks by infected monsters, or a magical curse.": "治疗师们正在处理个别病例，但无法解决疫情的根本原因，比如受污染的水源，生物战，被感染怪物的攻击，或者魔法诅咒。",
	"Supplies needed to properly equip doctors and spellcasters are scarce.": "为了正确装备医生和施法者，所需的物资很少。(Doctors and spellcasters)",
	"A powerful authority is ignoring or blocking aid to the infected because doing so would detract from some political goal.": "一个强大的当局正在无视或阻止对感染者的援助，因为这样做会削弱某种政治目标。",
	"What if the players have one or more healers in their ranks, and wish to spend days performing healing services? It may be prudent to simply allow them to do this. Players have limited resources, and spending time healing means they have fewer resources available to confront danger, so this course of action comes with risk.": "如果玩家队伍中有一名或多名治疗者，并希望花费几天时间提供治疗服务，那该怎么办呢？也许简单地允许他们这样做是明智的。玩家的资源是有限的，花时间进行治疗意味着他们在面对危险时可用资源更少，因此这种行动是有风险的。",
	"Below are roll tables with a few suggested plot hooks or story ideas that incorporate the diseases described in this document. These are only suggestions and don't represent the whole scope of how a disease can be used in a campaign.": "以下是一些掷骰表，其中包含一些建议的情节钩子或故事创意，这些创意融入了本文描述的疾病。这些仅仅是建议，不代表疾病在游戏中可以被应用的全部范围。",

	"{@b Pronouncement} describes a threat or warning to the target of the curse, or anyone who might eventually fall foul to it.": "{@b Pronouncement}描述了对诅咒目标或最终可能受到诅咒影响的人的威胁或警告。",
	"{@b Burden} explains the effects of the curse in game terms.": "{@b Burden} 用游戏术语解释了诅咒的影响。",
	"{@b Resolution} explains how the curse might be ended.": "{@b Resolution} 解释了如何结束这个诅咒。",

	"{@b Pronouncement:} This curse is levied at a creature that uses foul language in a highly inappropriate setting or who speaks ill of an important figure, and includes a reference to the old saying of 'washing your mouth out with soap'.": "{@b Pronouncement:} 这个诅咒针对在极不恰当的场合使用粗言秽语或说重要人物的坏话的生物施加，其中包括了“用肥皂洗嘴”的谚语。",
	"{@b Burden:} Whenever the cursed creature speaks, bubbles emerge from its mouth instead of words. If these bubbles are popped, the intended spoken words of the creature is emitted from it. Each bubble can contain a phrase up to 20 words long, so longer sentences create more bubble. The bubbles float upwards and are carried by even the softest breezes. Trying to pop a bubble requires a DC 13 Dexterity check.": "{@b Burden:}每当被诅咒的生物开口说话时，从它的嘴里冒出泡泡，而不是言语。如果这些泡泡被戳破，生物打算说的话就会从中发出。每个泡泡最多可以包含20个字的短语，因此较长的句子会产生更多的泡泡。这些泡泡向上飘浮，即使是微风也能带走它们。尝试戳破一个泡泡需要进行一次DC 13的敏捷检定。",
	"{@b Resolution:} The curse instantly ends if the cursed creature uses soap to wash out the inside of its mouth.": "{@b Resolution:} 如果被诅咒的生物用肥皂清洗口腔内部，诅咒会立即结束。",
	"This curse punishes callousness by trapping its victim in cold and loneliness with a literal heart of ice.": "这个诅咒惩罚冷酷无情，将受害者困在寒冷和孤独中，拥有一颗冰冷的心。",
	"{@b Pronouncement:} Directed at someone who shows a lack of empathy. {@i 'For your cold heart, may you never feel warmth again.'}": "{@b Pronouncement:} 针对那些缺乏同理心的人。{@i 'For your cold heart, may you never feel warmth again.'}",
	"{@b Burden:} The affected creature becomes unable to tolerate heat. If the creature is in an area with an ambient temperature higher than 0 degrees Celsius, it suffers the effects of {@hazard Extreme Heat}, but is immune to the effects of {@hazard Extreme Cold}. It gains a vulernability to fire damage, but is resistant to cold damage. Close contact with warm-blooded creatures, such as holding hands, grappling, or applying bandages, deals 1 fire damage to the cursed creature. The cursed creature itself has no body heat, and feels cold to the touch.": "{@b Burden:} 受影响的生物变得无法忍受热量。如果生物处于环境温度高于0摄氏度的区域，它将遭受{@hazard Extreme Heat}的影响，但对{@hazard Extreme Cold}的影响免疫。它对火焰伤害具有脆弱性，但对冷冻伤害具有抗性。与温血生物密切接触，例如握手、搏斗或敷敷绷带，会对被诅咒的生物造成1点火焰伤害。被诅咒的生物本身没有体温，触摸时感觉寒冷。",
	"{@b Resolution:} Only an act of true kindness can break this curse.": "{@b Resolution:} 只有一次真正的善举才能打破这个诅咒。",
	"A torment meant to punish greed, or to reduce a powerful foe into an ineffective eccentric. The cursed is driven to collect a certain kind of object.": "一种旨在惩罚贪婪，或将强大的敌人变成无效的古怪人的折磨。 被诅咒者被驱使着收集一种特定类型的物品。",
	"{@b Pronouncement:} The pronouncement of this curse references a specific kind of object. It could be part of a set such as every shard of a broken sword or every coin from a stolen treasure, or it could be a kind of general object such as gems, spoons, mugs, dice, figurines, shoes, etc.": "{@b Pronouncement:} 这个诅咒的宣告涉及到特定类型的物品。它可以是一组物品的一部分，比如一把断剑的每一片碎片或者一宝藏中的每一枚硬币，也可以是一种常见的物品，比如宝石、勺子、马克杯、骰子、小雕像、鞋子等。",
	"{@b Burden:} The affected creature feels a compulsion to collect the specific type of object. It refuses to relinquish objects of that type in its possession or allow objects in its posession to be destroyed. If another creature takes an object from the cursed creature's collection, it is magically compelled to retrieve the object by any means available to it. If the creature goes a day without gaining a new object for its collection, it must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it gains one form of indefinite madness (DMG page 260). For each day the creature goes without aquiring a new object for its collection, or retrieving an object taken from its collection, the DC increases by 1. After it gains a new object, the creature loses one form of madness every 24 hours and the saving throw against madness decreases by 1, as long as it continues to grow its collection.": "{@b Burden:} 受影响的生物感到一种强烈的冲动，要收集特定类型的物品。它拒绝放弃其所有物品中的该类型物品，也不允许其所有物品被销毁。如果另一个生物从被诅咒生物的收藏中拿走一个物品，它会被魔法驱使以任何可用手段取回该物品。如果生物一天内没有获得新的收藏物品，它必须进行一次DC 10的感知豁免检定。如果豁免失败，它会获得一种持续性疯狂状态（DMG 第260页）。对于每一天生物没有获取新的收藏物品，或取回被拿走的收藏物品，DC值就会增加1。在生物获得新物品后，每24小时生物就会失去一种疯狂状态，而对抗疯狂的豁免检定值会减少1，只要它继续扩展它的收藏物品。",
	"{@b Resolution:} If the objects belong to a set, then returning the completed set to its rightful owner will lift the curse. Knowing this doesn't affect the cursed creature's behaviour: it still refuses to part with its collection.": "{@b Resolution:} 如果这些物品属于一个集合，那么将完成的集合归还给其合法所有者将解除诅咒。知道这一点并不会影响被诅咒生物的行为：它仍然拒绝与它的收藏品分开。",
	"For a generic object type, a creature can be freed from this curse if it destroys its own collection. Knowing this doesn't change its behaviour, it still refuses to part with its collection in any way, but it can still be freed if it unknowingly or accidentally destroys its collection, or if it is compelled to do so by magic. The creature has to destroy its own collection: another creature doing so won't relieve the burden of the curse.": "对于一种通用的物体类型，一个生物可以通过摧毁自己的收藏品来解除这个诅咒。即使知道这一点也不会改变它的行为，它仍然拒绝以任何方式与自己的收藏品分开，但如果它在不知情或意外地摧毁了自己的收藏品，或者被魔法强迫这样做，它仍然可以被解除。生物必须摧毁自己的收藏品：其他生物这样做不会解除诅咒的负担。",
	"This devious curse creates an exact duplicate of its target that can torment it in a variety of ways, from being a perfect match in battle to more insidious psychological attacks.": "这个狡猾的诅咒会制造出目标的一个完全复制品，可以通过各种方式折磨目标，从在战斗中成为完美对手到更加隐匿的心理攻击。",
	"{@b Pronouncement:} This curse affects a creature that disturbs an ancient sarcophagus containing the soul of an ancient sorcerer, imprisoned fiend, or other villain. An inscription on the tomb warns against tampering, lest {@i 'You shall be your own worst enemy'}.": "{@b Pronouncement:} 这个诅咒影响着打扰古代石棺中封印着古代巫师、囚禁恶魔或其他恶棍灵魂的生物。墓碑上的铭文警告不要篡改，否则{@i 'You shall be your own worst enemy'}。",
	"{@b Burden:} A creature affectd by this curse suffers no immediate effects. 24 hours after the curse takes effect, an exact duplicate of the cursed creature appears inside the sarcophagus. It has all the memories of the cursed, along with all of its game statistics and class features, but none of its equipment. However, it despises the cursed creature, and either wishes to ruin that creature's life and reputation, or wishes to kill and replace the cursed and live on in their place. If the duplicate is killed, another exact duplicate appears in the sarcophagus with all the memories of the previous duplicate.": "{@b Burden:} 被这个诅咒影响的生物不会立即受到影响。在诅咒生效后的24小时内，诅咒生物的精确复制体会出现在石棺内。它拥有诅咒生物的所有记忆，以及所有的游戏统计数据和职业特性，但没有任何装备。然而，它鄙视诅咒生物，并希望毁掉那个生物的生活和声誉，或者希望杀死并取代诅咒生物，继续活在他们的位置上。如果复制体被杀死，另一个精确的复制体会出现在石棺中，拥有前一个复制体的所有记忆。",
	"{@b Resolution:} Killing the duplicate is only a temporary measure. The only way to end the curse is to re-seal the duplicate inside the sarcophagus.": "{@b Resolution:} 杀死复制品只是一个临时措施。结束诅咒的唯一方法是重新将复制品封印在石棺内。",
	"As a punishment against the vainglorious, people cursed in this way can never achieve lasting recognition for their deeds, and even simply interpersonal relationships become impossible.": "作为对虚荣者的惩罚，被人们这样诅咒的人永远无法获得其行为的持久认可，甚至简单的人际关系也变得不可能。(vainglorious)",
	"{@b Pronouncement:} This curse is directed at those who seek to be famous and commit terrible deeds to do so. Alternatively, it is directed at those who seek to rewrite history in their favour.": "{@b Pronouncement:} 这个诅咒针对那些试图通过犯下可怕行为来获得名声的人。或者，它也可以针对那些试图篡改历史以谋取私利的人。",
	"{@b Burden:} If the cursed creature isn't percieved by someone else for 10 consecutive minutues, that person forgets that the cursed person ever existed. Any illogical or impossible memories as a result of this are rationalised e.g. if the cursed creature did something significant, other people simply assume it didn't happen or that someone else did it. Other people tend to ignore or overlook evidence of the cursed person's existence unless it is explicticly pointed out to them.": "{@b Burden:} 如果被诅咒的生物连续10分钟没有被他人察觉，那个人会忘记被诅咒的人曾经存在过。由此产生的任何不合逻辑或不可能的记忆都会被合理解释，例如，如果被诅咒的生物做了重要的事情，其他人会简单地假设那件事没有发生或者是其他人做的。其他人倾向于忽视或忽略被诅咒者存在的证据，除非有人明确指出。",
	"{@b Resolution:} The curse is lifted if the cursed intentionally takes a course of action where they turn down the possibility of renown of their deeds, or allow someone else to take credit for their deeds. For example, they could destroy a statue erected in their honour, or claim that a companion actually slew a monster they killed.": "{@b Resolution:} 如果被诅咒者故意采取行动，拒绝让自己的事迹被人知晓，或者让别人夺取他们的功绩，那么诅咒就会解除。例如，他们可以摧毁为自己而立的雕像，或声称是同伴实际上杀死了他们击败的怪物。",
	"This curse is only noticable in the reflection of the afflicted, revealing their true nature.": "这个诅咒只有在受诅者的倒影中才能被注意到，揭示出他们真实的本性。",
	"{@b Pronouncement:} This curse is levied at someone with an evil nature whose wicked deeds are kept secret, usually by someone who knows the secret but cannot expose it, or whose testimony won't be believed.": "{@b Pronouncement:} 这个诅咒针对一个邪恶本性的人，其恶行被保密，通常是由知道这个秘密但无法揭露它的人施加的，或者是其证词不会被相信的人。",
	"{@b Burden:} The affected creature experiences a nightmare where they see themselves twisted in some monstrous way, such as appearing like a corpse, or having bestial features. When the creature awakens, it appears normal. However, it's reflection always appears as it did in the nightmare, to anyone who sees it. If the cursed creature sees its reflection, it becomes frightened of it. If it attacks its own reflection, such as by shattering a mirror or throwing a stone into water, the cursed creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage.": "{@b Burden:} 受影响的生物经历了一个噩梦，在梦中他们看到自己以某种怪物的方式扭曲，比如看起来像尸体，或者有着野兽的特征。当生物醒来时，它看起来正常。然而，对于任何看到它的人来说，它的倒影总是像噩梦中那样。如果被诅咒的生物看到自己的倒影，它会因此感到恐惧。如果它攻击自己的倒影，比如打碎镜子或者往水里扔石头，被诅咒的生物会受到5(1d10)点精神伤害。",
	"{@b Resolution:} Publically revealing the terrible secret or true nature of the afflicted does not end this curse. Instead, it causes the cursed creature's appearance to become like that of its reflection. Only true atonement, and a sincere change of heart, will end this curse. Once the creature's nature has changed, it ceases to be frightened by its reflection, and touching its reflection returns it to normal.": "{@b Resolution:} 公开揭示受诅咒者可怕的秘密或真实本质并不能结束这个诅咒。相反，这会导致被诅咒的生物外表变得像它的倒影一样。只有真正的赎罪和真诚的改变才能结束这个诅咒。一旦生物的本性发生改变，它就不再被自己的倒影吓到，触摸倒影会使其恢复正常。",
	"Alternatively, if the cursed creature reveals its own villainy, and fully embraces its deeds, then the curse's magic fails: the creature's wickedness is no longer a secret burden, thus this curse is no longer able to serve as a suitable punishment.": "另一种情况是，如果被诅咒的生物揭露了自己的恶行，并完全接受了自己的行为，那么诅咒的魔法就会失败：生物的邪恶不再是一个秘密的负担，因此这个诅咒就不再能作为一种合适的惩罚。",
	"A tongue-twisting curse that inhibits a creature's ability to speak.": "一种绕口令般的诅咒，阻止生物说话的能力。",
	"{@b Pronouncement:} This curse is caused by reading a cursed book written in bizzarre nonsensical script, and the words {@i 'The words of this book make no sense. Read them, and only Nonsense will make sense. So be Sensible'}.": "{@b Pronouncement:} 这个诅咒是由阅读一本用奇怪的无意义文字写成的被诅咒书籍引起的，其中的文字{@i 'The words of this book make no sense. Read them, and only Nonsense will make sense. So be Sensible'}。",
	"The inside cover of the book warns against attempting to decipher the scrawl within. Merely observing the pages isn't enough, a creature only becomes cursed if they attempt to translate, decode, or otherwise interpret the words written on the pages.": "书的内页警告不要尝试解读其中的潦草文字。仅仅观察页面是不够的，只有当生物尝试翻译、解码或以其他方式解释页面上的文字时，它们才会受到诅咒。",
	"{@b Burden:} The cursed creature cannot communicate with or understand any language. If it tries to speak or write, it only knows how to communicate in Nonsense. Translating nonsense is impossible: it has no translation, since it is completely nonsensical. Telepathy does not allow sensical communication either. However, two people cursed in this way can understand each other perfectly through any medium, even if they would normally not share any languages.": "{@b Burden:} 被诅咒的生物无法与任何语言进行交流或理解。如果它尝试说话或写作，它只能用胡言乱语进行交流。翻译胡言乱语是不可能的：它没有翻译，因为它完全是无意义的。心灵感应也无法进行有意义的交流。然而，以这种方式被诅咒的两个人可以通过任何媒介完美地理解彼此，即使他们通常不会共享任何语言。",
	"{@b Resolution:} A creature affected by this curse can still learn new languages, since languages it previously didn't understand are nonsensical to them and thus aren't affected by the curse's burden. Doing so creates sense out of nonsense, breaking the curse's magic. The same applies if it uses magic to be able to understand a language it previously couldn't (but not if another creature attempts to use magic to translate Nonsense, since that doesn't work, or if it uses magic to understand a language it is normally proficient in). Effects that completely disable a creature's ability to understand any kind of language (such as the Feeblemind spell) cause the curse to fail.": "{@b Resolution:} 受到这个诅咒影响的生物仍然可以学习新语言，因为它之前不理解的语言对它来说是荒谬的，因此不受诅咒的影响。这样做可以从荒谬中找到意义，打破诅咒的魔法。如果它使用魔法来理解之前无法理解的语言（但如果另一个生物尝试使用魔法来翻译荒谬的话，那是行不通的，或者如果它使用魔法来理解它通常精通的语言也不行）。完全禁用生物理解任何语言能力的效果（比如《心灵衰弱》咒语）会导致诅咒失败。",
	"Rats follow in the footsteps of the cursed, whether they like it or not. As rats bear diseases and pilfer food, this is likely to make the cursed unwelcome in humanoid settlements.": "老鼠无论喜欢与否，都会跟随着被诅咒者的脚步。由于老鼠传播疾病并偷窃食物，这很可能会导致被诅咒者在人类定居点不受欢迎。",
	"{@b Pronouncement:} This curse is usually directed at people of high social status or noble title, such as a knight or respected priest, and is done so in response to the individual committing some dishonourable deed not in line with the expectations of their station, with the utterance of {@i 'If you must act so wretchedly, then you deserve only to be a master of rats.'}": "{@b Pronouncement:} 这种诅咒通常针对社会地位高或贵族头衔的人，比如骑士或备受尊敬的牧师，是对个人犯下不符合其身份期望的不光彩行为做出的回应，伴随着 {@i 'If you must act so wretchedly, then you deserve only to be a master of rats.'} 的念咒。",
	"{@b Burden:} Rats within 300ft of the cursed creature become obsessed with them, and belive the cursed to be their Lord. These rats always know the direction to the Rat Lord and do their best to follow them or get near to them. Once a rat has been influenced in this way, the effect persists until the curse ends or the rat is more than 1 mile away from the Rat Lord for 24 hours. The rats will flee if attacked, but return as soon as they believe the danger to be over, and will only flee as far as they need to. Otherwise, their only goal is to be as close to their lord as possible at all times.": "{@b Burden:} 在距离被诅咒生物300英尺内的老鼠会对它们产生痴迷，认为被诅咒者是它们的主人。这些老鼠总是知道通往老鼠领主的方向，并尽力跟随或靠近它们。一旦一只老鼠受到这种影响，效果会持续，直到诅咒结束或老鼠离开老鼠领主超过1英里并且持续24小时。老鼠会在受到攻击时逃跑，但一旦它们认为危险已经过去，就会返回，只会逃到必要的距离。否则，它们的唯一目标就是始终尽可能靠近它们的主人。",
	"{@b Resolution:} The cursed must complete an act of nobility in line with their noble rank or social status, usually involving some sort of sacrifice or an act of great humility to prove themselves worthy of their station.": "{@b Resolution:} 被诅咒者必须根据其贵族身份或社会地位完成一项贵族行为，通常涉及某种牺牲或极度谦卑的行为，以证明自己配得上自己的地位。",
	"Alternatively, they can pass on the curse to someone else. A willing creature declares themselves the new Rat Lord, while the cursed makes a symbolic offering and humbles themself before the new lord.": "另外，他们可以将诅咒传给其他人。 一个愿意的生物宣布自己是新的鼠王，而被诅咒者则进行象征性的献祭，并在新主面前谦卑自己。",
	"This curse is meant as an ironic punishment - and a horrifying transformation - towards traitors and deceivers.": "这个诅咒旨在对叛徒和欺骗者进行讽刺惩罚，以及令人恐惧的转变。",
	"{@b Pronouncement:} A person that suffers a terrible fate as result of a betrayal or lie told about them may lay this curse through their anguish and rage.": "{@b Pronouncement:} 一个人因为被背叛或被撒谎而遭受可怕命运的人，可能会通过他们的痛苦和愤怒施加这个诅咒。",
	"{@b Burden:} The cursed creature grows a second face on their body, usually out the back of their head. Whenever a creature tells a deliberate lie or tries to conceal the truth, the second face will reveal the truth. If the cursed creature tries to persuade someone of the truth or reveal a lie, then the second face will tell a lie.": "{@b Burden:} 被诅咒的生物在身体上长出第二张脸，通常是在头部后面。每当一个生物说出故意的谎言或试图掩盖真相时，第二张脸会揭示真相。如果被诅咒的生物试图说服某人相信真相或揭示谎言，那么第二张脸会说谎。",
	"{@b Resolution:} This curse ends when the cursed creature reveals the truth about the lie they told or proves the innocence of someone they betrayed. They must also reveal the presence of their curse, laying bare their two-faced nature.": "{@b Resolution:} 当被诅咒的生物揭露他们所说谎言的真相或证明他们背叛的人的清白时，这个诅咒就会结束。他们还必须揭露自己被诅咒的事实，暴露他们的两面性。",
	"This curse is meant as an ironic punishment for those who overly value physical beauty.": "这个诅咒是为那些过分看重外貌的人而设计的讽刺惩罚。",
	"{@b Pronouncement:} Usually directed at someone who has just committed a grevious act of vanity, or disparages someone for their superficial appearance, especially if that person is much mightier than their looks would suggest. {@i If beauty be all that concerns you, then let it be eternal, cast in stone!'}.": "{@b Pronouncement:}通常用于指责刚刚犯下严重虚荣行为的人，或者贬低某人的肤浅外表，尤其是当这个人比他们的外表所显示的更强大时。{@i If beauty be all that concerns you, then let it be eternal, cast in stone!'}。",
	"{@b Burden:} The cursed creature slowly begins to turn to stone. At first only visual indicators appear, with patches of stony-looking skin appearing on their body. After one day their speed is halved and they have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that use Dexterity. After two days their speed becomes 0 ft and can't benefit from increases to speed. After three days, they become Petrified.": "{@b Burden:} 被诅咒的生物开始慢慢变成石头。起初只有视觉指标出现，身体上出现了一些看起来像石头的斑块。一天后，他们的速度减半，并且在所有使用敏捷度进行的攻击检定、技能检定和豁免检定中都有劣势。两天后，他们的速度变为0英尺，无法受益于速度增加。三天后，他们变成石化状态。",
	"{@b Resolution:} Magic that would cure petrification can't end this curse. Instead, it can only revert the creature to a partially cured state, as if it had the curse for one day. To permenantly end the curse, the creature must either intentionally deface its physical appearance, or intentionally appear in public in a humiliating or unappealing state.": "{@b Resolution:} 无法解除石化的魔法无法结束这个诅咒。相反，它只能将生物恢复到部分治愈状态，就好像被诅咒了一天一样。要永久解除诅咒，生物必须有意毁坏其外貌，或故意以羞辱或不吸引人的状态出现在公众面前。",
	"This curse is usually levied at those who committed a terrible crime and got away with it. The shadow of their deeds shall follow them forever.": "这个诅咒通常针对那些犯下了可怕罪行却逍遥法外的人。他们的罪行阴影将永远追随着他们。",
	"{@b Pronouncement:} This curse is uttered by the victim of a crime who knows that the crime against them will never be solved, such as a dying person who knows there are no witnesses, or a marginalised beggar who knows that nobody will bother to seek justice on their behalf. {@i 'Your wickedness shall forever follow in your shadow, but remember: what happens in the dark always comes to the light.'}": "{@b Pronouncement:} 这种诅咒是由犯罪受害者发出的，他们知道对他们的犯罪永远不会被解决，比如一个垂死的人知道没有目击者，或者一个被边缘化的乞丐知道没有人会为他们寻求正义。{@i 'Your wickedness shall forever follow in your shadow, but remember: what happens in the dark always comes to the light.'}",
	"{@b Burden:} The cursed creature's shadow becomes magically animated. Once a day, it can leave the cursed creature's side, and uses the statistics of a Shadow (Monster Manual pg 269). If it is destroyed or is away from the cursed creature for more than 24 hours, it reappears at the creature's side, as if it were an ordinary shadow. While independent, it seeks to commit evil acts similar to that committed by the cursed creature. It may also attempt to implicate the cursed creature in these crimes. At all other times, it appears to be an ordinary shadow, and cannot be detected by magic that would detect undead. While away, the cursed creature casts no shadow.": "{@b Burden:} 被诅咒生物的影子被魔法激活。每天一次，它可以离开被诅咒生物的身边，并使用暗影的统计数据（怪物手册第269页）。如果它被摧毁或离开被诅咒生物超过24小时，它会重新出现在生物身边，就像是一个普通的影子。在独立行动时，它会试图犯下与被诅咒生物类似的邪恶行为。它还可能试图牵连被诅咒生物参与这些罪行。在其他时间，它看起来像一个普通的影子，无法被探测亡灵的魔法所探测到。在离开时，被诅咒生物不会投射影子。",
	"{@b Resolution:} The curse can lifted by applying the words of the pronouncement in a literal or figurative manner. Solving the original crime and bringing that knowledge to light will lift the curse, but only if the wrongdoer would suffer some kind of punishment for doing so. Applying the words literally can also end the curse: catching the wayward shadow in the midst of its misdeeds and casting bright light over it destroys the Shadow, and ends the curse.": "{@b Resolution:} 通过以字面或比喻的方式应用宣言的话语，可以解除诅咒。解决原始犯罪并将这一知识揭示出来将解除诅咒，但前提是错误行为者必须因此受到某种惩罚。字面上应用这些话语也可以结束诅咒：在其恶行中捕捉那个误入歧途的阴影，并用明亮的光线照射它，摧毁阴影，从而结束诅咒。",
	"The Atonement function of the {@spell Ceremony|xge|} spell can also end the curse, if it is cast by a follower of a deity of light or the sun.": "如果由光明或太阳神的信徒施放，{@spell Ceremony|xge|}法术的赎罪功能也可以解除诅咒。",
	"What happens when the target of a curse isn't a player? A curse can be a central element in a story. Perhaps the players are tasked with lifting a curse, or the villain of the story is the curse's victim. When not applied to players, you can take greater liberties with how the curse affects its victim. As written, a Rat Lord has no control over the rats that follow them, but you may wish a villainous Rat Lord to have such control. Or a non-player cursed with a Horrid Reflection frightens other people instead of themselves with their reflection. Such abilities could be too strong in the hands of creative players, and thus the curse fail to be a meaningful burden at all. But in the hands of the DM, can enhance the story. Many a curse in fiction comes with great power attached, but usually in such a way that the power isn't worth the price.": "当诅咒的目标不是玩家时会发生什么？诅咒可以是故事的核心元素。也许玩家被委托解除诅咒，或者故事的反派是诅咒的受害者。当诅咒不施加在玩家身上时，你可以更自由地决定诅咒如何影响受害者。比如，一个鼠王没有控制其跟随者老鼠的能力，但你可能希望一个邪恶的鼠王拥有这种控制力。或者一个非玩家被诅咒后，他们的可怕倒影吓到别人而不是自己。这样的能力可能在有创造力的玩家手中太强大，因此诅咒可能根本不成为一个有意义的负担。但在DM的手中，可以增强故事。许多小说中的诅咒都伴随着巨大的力量，但通常这种力量并不值得付出代价。",
	"You can also use this to make a curse much more of a burden on a non-player character. Some of the mechanics of these curses as listed are meant to be fair on players, still allowing a player to enjoy the game while cursed, or to mitigate some of the curse's worst effects. NPCs under the control of the DM need no such mercy, and thus their curse might be more severe or more difficult to resolve.": "你也可以利用这个方法让诅咒对非玩家角色造成更大的负担。列出的一些诅咒机制旨在对玩家公平，仍然允许玩家在被诅咒的情况下享受游戏，或者减轻一些诅咒的最严重影响。由DM控制的NPC不需要这样的仁慈，因此他们的诅咒可能更严重或更难解决。",
	"This kind of hazard includes all kinds of dangerous plant, fungus, or immobile beasts.": "这种危险包括各种危险的植物、真菌或不动的野兽。",
	"This kind of hazard or terrain abnormality come about as a result of geological phenomena and typically don't involve magic. ": "这种危险或地形异常是由地质现象引起的，通常不涉及魔法。",
	"These are supernatural events, and only arise from the presence of magical beings or incursions from other planes.": "这些是超自然事件，只有在有魔法生物存在或其他位面入侵时才会发生。",
	"An easy way of creating a magical trap is to use the {@spell Glyph of Warding} with the Spell Glyph function. This can be an actual Glyph of Warding spell, or other magic that functions in an identical manner, and makes sense in any dungeon that is guarded by a villain with access to spells of 3rd level or higher. But what spells to use? A simple damaging spell such as Fireball or Cloudkill is the most obvious choice, but there are endless creative options that let you use this kind of trap in interesting ways. Consider some of the following spells:": "创建一个魔法陷阱的简单方法是使用{@spell Glyph of Warding}与法术雕文功能。这可以是一个真正的守护符文法术，或者其他以相同方式运作的魔法，在任何由一个具有3级或更高级法术访问权限的恶棍守卫的地牢中都是合理的。但要使用哪些法术呢？像火球术或毒雾术这样的简单伤害法术是最明显的选择，但还有无数创意选项，让你以有趣的方式使用这种陷阱。考虑以下一些法术：",

	"The Dungeon Master's Guide describes seven kinds of siege equipment, and mentions how some kinds of siege weapons can be loaded with different types of projectiles for different effects.

Against foes attacking in cold windy weather, it can quickly cause hypothermia, and leave a slippery hazard as it freezes on surfaces.": "在某些气候条件下，冰冷的水很容易获得，这使它成为一种经济实惠的武器选择。对抗在寒冷多风的天气中攻击的敌人，它可以迅速导致体温过低，并在表面结冰后留下滑倒的危险。",

	"There are countless ways of applying the contents of this document in your adventures. One way is to use them to inspire new monsters or as modifications to existing monsters. Sometimes a small twist is all you need to make a familiar foe feel fresh and exciting. Below are a few sample stat blocks to aid you. They are all creatures from the Monster Manual with one or two appropriate alterations. Bear in mind a couple of thing: First, that these are just examples to get you started and don't even begin to scratch the surface of how curses, diseases, hazards, traps, or poisons could be used in a campaign. Second, that non-player characters need not follow the same rules as player characters. Instead of following the rules written here to the letter, your focus should instead be on creating something that makes intuitive sense to the players, and is fun to engage with. For example, Contagious Troll Tumours only grants a very small amount of hitpoint regeneration to an infected player, since regeneration is a very powerful ability, but isn't meaningful when applied to a monster in a combat encounter. Instead, it makes more sense to give that monster regeneration more akin to that of a troll. It's more impactful and makes more sense to the players. Your players can't see the monster stat blocks, and likely won't notice as long as the mechanics remain somewhat consistent.": "有无数种方法可以在你的冒险中应用这份文件的内容。其中一种方法是用它们来启发新的怪物或者作为对现有怪物的修改。有时候，只需要一个小小的变化就能让一个熟悉的敌人变得新鲜和令人兴奋。以下是一些样本属性块，以帮助你。它们都是《怪物手册》中的生物，只是做了一两个适当的改动。请记住几件事：首先，这些只是为了让你入门的例子，并且甚至不能涉及如何在冒险中使用诅咒、疾病、危险、陷阱或毒药。其次，NPC不需要遵循与PC相同的规则。与其一丝不苟地遵循这里写的规则，你应该把重点放在创造一些对玩家来说直观合理且有趣的东西上。例如，(Contagious Troll Tumours)只给被感染的玩家提供了非常少量的生命值恢复，因为恢复是一个非常强大的能力，但在应用于战斗中的怪物时并没有意义。相反，给那个怪物赋予更类似巨魔的恢复能力更有意义。这对玩家更有影响力，也更符合逻辑。你的玩家看不到怪物的属性块，只要机制保持一致，他们很可能不会注意到。",
	"Shroud Vine bushes grow into eerie silhouettes of the creature that spawned them, but are otherwise normal bushes. Thus, they can be targeted by any magic that affects plants, such as the {@spell Awaken} spell.": "荫藤灌木长成了产生它们的生物的怪异轮廓，但除此之外是普通的灌木。因此，它们可以被任何影响植物的魔法所瞄准，比如{@spell Awaken}法术。",

	"{@b Treatment:} The disease is unusually hardy to disease-curing magic, perhaps as a result of living endemically in humanoid populations in ancient times. Most attempts to cure the disease using magic will just produce stomach pains. The disease has natural defences against both medicine and magic that would destroy it. The disease must first be weakened with poison. The poison must be mixed with humanoid flesh or blood to ensure that pathogen doesn't reject it, and then the poison must be consumed in order to flush it through the infected creature's digestive system. Once this has been done, magic or medicine will work as normal.": "{@b Treatment:} 这种疾病对治愈魔法异常强大，可能是由于在古代在人类族群中大量存在。大多数使用魔法治疗这种疾病的尝试只会导致胃痛。这种疾病对药物和能够摧毁它的魔法都有天然的防御机制。必须首先用毒药削弱这种疾病。毒药必须与人类的血肉混合以确保病原体不会排斥它，然后必须食用毒药以将其冲洗通过被感染生物的消化系统。一旦这样做了，魔法或药物将会像正常情况下一样起作用。",
	"{@b Symptoms:} The afflicted creature gains a mild form of a troll's regeneration powers, but injuries form dangerous tumours of troll flesh as they heal, usually appearing as green lumps which can form both internally and externally. While they don't impede the afflicted in any way, they are extremely painful and uncomfortable.

Worse still, these embedded growths of troll flesh can regenerate into an entire troll if the growths kill the afflicted.": "{@b Symptoms:} 受影响的生物获得了类似巨魔再生能力的轻微形式，但伤口愈合时会形成危险的巨魔肉瘤，通常表现为绿色肿块，可以在内部和外部形成。虽然这些肿块不会以任何方式妨碍受影响者，但它们非常疼痛和不舒服。在极端情况下，缺失的肢体会再生成类似巨魔的形态，或者受影响者会长出小的残留附肢。更糟糕的是，这些嵌入的巨魔肉块可以再生成整个巨魔，如果这些肿块杀死了受影响者。",
	"{@b Effects:} The afflicted creature regenerates 1 hitpoint at the start of each of its turns, unless it has taken acid or fire damage since the start of its previous turn. If it's missing any body parts, they regrow when the creature finishes a long rest. An afflicted creature doesn't die or make death saving throws unless it cannot regenerate at the start of its turn, although it can still die normally by failing three death saves or through taking massive damage. For every 10 hitpoints the afflicted creature regenerates, or for each missing body part it regrows, the afflicted creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saved, one green tumour of troll flesh forms on its body. The DC of the save equals 10 plus the number of tumours on the creature's body. If the DC of the saving throw reaches 20, and the creature fails that saving throw, it dies, and the tumours immediately grow into a Troll which appears in the dead creature's space. The afflicted creature automatically gains one tumour for every 24 hours that passes.": "{@b Effects:} 受影响的生物在每个回合开始时恢复1点生命值，除非自上一个回合开始以来受到酸性或火焰伤害。如果生物缺少任何身体部位，在生物完成长休息时它们会重新生长。受影响的生物不会死亡或进行死亡豁免投掷，除非它在回合开始时无法再生，尽管它仍然可以通过失败三次死亡豁免投掷或受到大量伤害而正常死亡。对于受影响的生物每恢复10点生命值，或每重新生长一个缺失的身体部位，受影响的生物必须进行一次体质豁免投掷。未通过豁免的话，生物身上会形成一个绿色的巨魔肉瘤。豁免的 DC 值等于生物身上肉瘤数量加上 10。如果豁免的 DC 值达到 20，并且生物未通过该豁免投掷，它将死亡，并且肉瘤立即长成一只巨魔，出现在死亡生物的位置。受影响的生物每过 24 小时会自动获得一个肉瘤。",
	"{@b Contracting:} Contagious Troll Tumours really stretch the definition of disease. Trolls can regenerate from almost any injury given time, but can be slain. In the process of battling a troll, it and its foe invariably end up covered in each other's blood. This usually isn't an issue, but if tiny parts of the troll's being end up lodged in an open wound, they can adhere themselves as they try to regenerate. Even after the troll dies, these pieces of flesh survive thanks to grafting themselves into the host's circulatory system. This is the start of a troll tumour. Like a cancer, it grows uncontrollably within the host yet is rooted into its basic bodily functions, kept alive by the thing it is killing. Troll flesh regenerates and mutates much quicker than any mundane cancer, quickly overwhelming any immune response. As it grows, small parts of the tumour can break off and seed themselves in other parts of the body, forming new tumours.": "{@b Contracting:} 传染性巨魔肿瘤真的拉长了疾病的定义。巨魔几乎可以从任何伤势中再生，但可以被杀死。在与巨魔战斗的过程中，它和它的敌人总会不可避免地被彼此的血液覆盖。通常这不是问题，但如果巨魔的微小部分被卡在开放的伤口中，它们会在尝试再生时粘附在那里。即使巨魔死去，这些肉块也能存活下来，因为它们嫁接到了宿主的循环系统中。这标志着巨魔肿瘤的开始。就像癌症一样，在宿主体内不受控制地生长，但却根植于其基本的生理功能，靠它正在杀死的东西维持生命。巨魔肉组织再生和突变的速度比任何世俗的癌症都要快，很快就会压倒任何免疫反应。随着它的增长，肿瘤的小部分可以脱落并在身体的其他部位扎根，形成新的肿瘤。",
	"Usually only a heavily wounded troll whose regeneration is struggling to keep it alive or whose dismembered limbs are flailing about on their own can inflict CTT, and the only people at risk are those who have open wounds from the troll's attacks and are also attacking it with piercing or slashing damage from within 5ft. Anything that prevents a troll from regenerating also prevents it from spreading CTT. A less common way of contracting it is to eat a troll. Stomach acid usually deals with any potential tumours, but eating enough troll can still cause a tumour especially if one has cuts, bruises, or sores inside the mouth. When a troll dies, the DM determines which if any of the creatures that participated in the fight could have come into contact with troll gore while having open wounds.": "通常只有一只受重伤的巨魔，其再生力量正在挣扎维持生命，或者其被切断的肢体在独自挥舞时才会传播CTT，而唯一有风险的人是那些被巨魔攻击造成开放性伤口，并且同时在5英尺范围内用刺击或斩击伤害攻击它的人。任何阻止巨魔再生的方法也会阻止CTT的传播。另一种较少见的感染方式是食用巨魔。胃酸通常会处理任何潜在的肿瘤，但是食用足够多的巨魔仍然可能导致肿瘤，尤其是如果口腔内有切口、瘀伤或溃疡。当一只巨魔死亡时，DM决定在战斗中参与的生物中，哪些可能与巨魔的血肉接触并且有开放性伤口。",

	"{@b Diagnosis:} Green troll flesh growths are easy to spot when they grow externally, but the usual giveaway for this affliction is the enhanced regeneration. Diagnosing the condition is tricky, but trickier still is knowing how to operate on the tumours without them simply growing back.

A creature that speaks Giant or otherwise has knowledge on giants and their history has advantage on ability checks made to diagnose CTT.": "{@b Diagnosis:} 绿色巨魔肉瘤在外部生长时很容易被发现，但通常的症状是增强再生能力。诊断这种病症很棘手，但更棘手的是知道如何在肿瘤上进行手术而不让它们重新生长。了解巨人知识的人更有可能准确诊断CTT。会说巨人语或者对巨人及其历史有了解的生物在进行CTT诊断的能力检定时获得优势。",

	"Wisdom (Medicine) 11 to 15 - You're not sure what caused these growths, but it seems that they get worse the more the afflicted regenerates from wounds. Using other forms of healing to close wounds before they can regenerate should slow down tumour growth.": "智慧（医学）11到15 - 你不确定是什么导致了这些生长，但似乎受影响者从伤口愈合的次数越多，这些生长就会变得更严重。在它们能够再生之前使用其他形式的治疗来关闭伤口应该可以减缓肿瘤的生长。",

	"{@b Treatment:} Trolls are extremely resilient even without their innate regeneration powers. CTT is no different. Tiny slivers of troll flesh inside the victim can be destroyed like almost any parasite, with magic that cures disease, but this will fail if any tumours have developed. The large tumours need to be surgically removed as they're too resilient to be magically cured. Removing a tumour requires a fine sharp instrument, and for the surgeon to make a Dexterity (Medicine) check. The surgeon can choose to only remove a selected number of tumours, which they may choose to do on fragile patients who might not easily survive a longer more invasive surgery. The DC of the check equals 10 plus the number of tumours the surgeon is attempting to remove. The surgery takes 5 minutes for each tumour the surgeon attempts to remove. On a success, the tumours are removed. If the total roll was less than 10, no tumours are removed. Otherwise, a partial success is achieved, and only some tumours are removed, an amount equal to the total of the medicine check minus 10. For each tumour removed, the patient takes 1 point of slashing damage. For each tumour the surgeon attempted to remove but failed, the patient takes 1+1d4 slashing damage. A removed tumour regrows unless the site of the tumour is immediately treated with acid or fire, enough to cause at least 1 point of damage.": "{@b Treatment:}巨魔即使没有天生的再生能力也非常顽强。CTT也不例外。受害者体内的微小巨魔肉片可以像几乎任何寄生虫一样被用治疗疾病的魔法摧毁，但如果出现了任何肿瘤，这种方法将失败。大肿瘤需要通过手术切除，因为它们太顽强，无法通过魔法治愈。切除肿瘤需要使用精细锋利的工具，并由外科医生进行敏捷（医学）检定。外科医生可以选择只切除选定数量的肿瘤，他们可能会选择在可能无法轻松度过更长时间的侵入性手术的脆弱患者身上这样做。检定的 DC 等于外科医生试图切除的肿瘤数量加上 10。每尝试切除一个肿瘤外科医生需要 5 分钟。成功后，肿瘤被切除。如果总检定小于 10，则不会切除任何肿瘤。否则，将实现部分成功，只会切除一些肿瘤，数量等于医学检定总和减去 10。每切除一个肿瘤，患者会受到 1 点割伤伤害。对于每个外科医生尝试切除但失败的肿瘤，患者会受到 1+1d4 点割伤伤害。切除的肿瘤会重新生长，除非肿瘤部位立即用足以造成至少 1 点伤害的酸或火进行处理。",
	"Unless the patient is incapacitated during the surgery, they are at risk of flinching. For each tumour removed while the patient is not incapacitated, the patient must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this save is 10 for a successfully removed tumour, 15 for a failed tumour removal. On a failed save, the patient flinches, and takes an additional 2d4 slashing damage from the tumour removal.": "除非患者在手术过程中无法行动，否则他们有可能会痉挛。在患者没有无法行动的情况下移除每个肿瘤时，患者必须进行一次体质豁免检定。对于成功移除的肿瘤，豁免 DC 为 10，对于失败的肿瘤移除，豁免 DC 为 15。在未通过豁免检定时，患者会痉挛，并受到额外 2d4 的切割伤害。",

	"{@b Symptoms:} Earwyrms are tiny wingless draconic creatures that reside in the ear canal of other creatures. They numb the flesh around them so their presence isn't felt, using poison stinger like those of pseudodragons, but they have a habit of mimicking sounds they hear, especially music, their relatively quiet voices being quite loud enough when their heads are resting on one's eardrum. Earwyrms are harmless, but incredibly annoying. Their compulsive music mimicry can inhibit a creature's ability to hear things properly or sleep, which is especially distracting for spellcasters, and getting them excited or riled can provoke them into singing so loudly that their host cannot hear anything at all. Earwyrms sneak out of their host's ear when they sleep once every three days to search for food.": "{@b Symptoms:} 耳蠕虫是一种居住在其他生物耳道中的小型无翼龙类生物。它们会麻木周围的组织，使它们的存在不被感知，使用类似伪龙的毒刺，但它们有模仿它们听到的声音的习惯，尤其是音乐，当它们的头部靠在耳膜上时，它们相对安静的声音就足够大了。耳蠕虫是无害的，但极其令人讨厌。它们强迫性的音乐模仿会影响生物正常听力或睡眠的能力，这对于施法者来说尤其分散注意力，激动或激怒它们可能会导致它们唱得如此大声，以至于宿主什么都听不见。耳蠕虫每三天会在宿主睡觉时从耳朵里悄悄爬出来寻找食物。",
	"{@b Effects:} Earwyrms have no stat block. They have a +0 bonus to all rolls, and have the Dragon type. While inhabiting another creature's ear canal, the Earwyrm has full cover against any effects originating from outside the host creature.": "{@b Effects:} 耳蠕虫没有属性块。它们对所有骰子投掷都有+0的奖励，并且拥有龙类别。当寄居在另一个生物的耳道中时，耳蠕虫对于来自宿主生物外部的任何效果都具有完全掩护。",
	"A creature infected by an Earwyrm cannot percieve the Earwyrm while it is not making noise. The DM determines the Earwyrm's behaviour, which is erratic. The Earwyrm will repeat sounds it has heard, usually music, but also animal sounds or speech, and will continue to do so while it is awake. The earwyrm sleeps for 6 hours a day. While the earwyrm is awake, an infected creature has disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. If the Earwyrm chooses, it can generate noise loud enough to deafen its host.": "一只被耳蠕虫感染的生物在耳蠕虫不发出声音时无法察觉它。DM决定耳蠕虫的行为，它的行为是不规律的。耳蠕虫会重复它听到的声音，通常是音乐，但也可能是动物的声音或语言，并且在清醒时会继续这样做。耳蠕虫每天会睡觉6小时。当耳蠕虫清醒时，被感染的生物在依赖听觉的所有感知智慧（感知）检查上都有劣势。如果耳蠕虫选择，它可以发出足够响亮的噪音使其宿主失聪。",
	"The Earwyrm is not normally dangerous, but is has a few ways of defending itself if a creature tries to remove it from its host.": "虫耳(Wyrmy)通常不具危险性，但如果有生物试图将它从寄主身上移除，它有几种自卫方式。",

Thus, Earwyrms will interfere on occasion whether their help is wanted or not, in the limited capacity as they are able. A Earwyrm will wake its host if they are sleeping and the Earwyrm percieves danger. They will intentionally deafen their host if the host is charmed by another creature, so that they can't hear any commands and thus cannot obey them. They will also use their screech to deal damage if the host is under the influence of magic such as the {@spell Sleep} or {@spell Dominate Person} spells where the target of the spell can repeat the save or end the effect if it takes damage.": "耳蠕虫并不十分聪明，但它们明白保持宿主活着对它们自身也有好处。因此，无论是否需要帮助，耳蠕虫都会在有限的能力范围内偶尔干涉。当耳蠕虫察觉到危险时，它会唤醒宿主，即使宿主正在睡觉。如果宿主被另一个生物迷惑，耳蠕虫会故意使宿主失聪，这样宿主就听不到任何命令，也就无法服从。此外，如果宿主受到像{@spell Sleep}或{@spell Dominate Person}等魔法影响，耳蠕虫还会利用它们的尖叫造成伤害，这些魔法会使法术目标在受到伤害时可以重复豁免或结束效果。",

	"{@b Contracting:} Earwyrms live in all kinds if environments, where they prowl for sleeping prey. When they encounter a sleeping creature, the Earwyrm makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the target's Passive Perception score. On a failed check, the creature notices something crawling on them, which feels similar to a large insect, and deters the Earwyrm. On a successful stealth check, the sleeping creature remians unaware and is infected by the Earwyrm. An Earwyrm that leaves its host to feed doesn't need to make this check again when it returns, as it uses its venom stinger to numb its host's sense of touch enough that the light tread of an Earwyrm can't be detected.": "{@b Contracting:} 耳蠕虫生活在各种环境中，它们潜行寻找睡着的猎物。当它们遇到正在睡觉的生物时，耳蠕虫会进行一次敏捷（潜行）检定，目标是目标的被动感知分数。检定失败时，生物会察觉到有东西在身上爬动，感觉像是一只大昆虫，从而吓跑了耳蠕虫。检定成功时，睡着的生物保持不知情，并被耳蠕虫感染。离开寄主进食的耳蠕虫在返回时无需再次进行此检定，因为它利用毒刺麻痹寄主的触觉，足够让耳蠕虫轻微的踩踏不被察觉。",
	"Some creatures are known to breed and train Earwyrms for domestic purposes, and intentionally allow themselves to become hosts. They are usually trained to mimic specific music the trainer wants them to repeat. More rarely, they're used for espionage, to act as hidden recording devices, and creatures that frequently come into conflict with mind-controlling creatures such as Illithids keep Earwyrms as rudimentary anti-charm measures. In these cases, the Earwyrms are likely to escape once they're out in the field unless fed frequently.": "一些生物以繁殖和训练耳蠕虫用于家庭用途，并故意让自己成为寄主而闻名。它们通常被训练模仿训练者想要它们重复的特定音乐。更少见的是，它们被用于间谍活动，充当隐藏的录音设备，经常与控制思维的生物（如吸脑怪）发生冲突的生物会将耳蠕虫作为基本的抗魅力措施。在这些情况下，耳蠕虫在外出后很可能会逃跑，除非经常喂食。",

	"{@b Symptoms:} A creature suffering from Glass Delusion believes themselves to be partially or wholly made of some brittle substance, most commonly glass but sometimes other substances like earthenware or ice. Usually the afflicted creature believes their bones or a single limb to be affected, but full-body delusions rarely occur. This belief persists even in the face of objective evidence to the contrary. Typically a delusional creature becomes paranoid that the affected body part is now exceptionally fragile and takes great measures to protect it from damage, such as wearing incredibly thick padded clothing, restraining the relevant area in a cast, or even refusing to leave a safe place. A less common symptom is the target believing themselves to be transparent and somehow that any lies or secrets are now laid bare for all to see. Most cases of Glass Delusion escalate into extreme paranoia, as the afflicted creature is hounded on all sides by people telling it something it \"knows\" not to be true, which can often make them difficult to approach for treatment.": "{@b Symptoms:} 一种患有玻璃妄想症的生物相信自己部分或完全由某种脆弱物质构成，最常见的是玻璃，但有时也可能是其他物质，比如陶器或冰。通常，受影响的生物相信他们的骨骼或某个肢体受到影响，但全身妄想很少发生。即使有客观证据证明相反，这种信念仍然持续存在。通常，患有妄想症的生物会变得偏执，认为受影响的身体部位现在异常脆弱，并采取极端措施来保护它免受损害，比如穿着异常厚的衬衫、用夹板约束相关区域，甚至拒绝离开安全的地方。一个较少见的症状是目标认为自己是透明的，以某种方式，任何谎言或秘密现在都被暴露给所有人看到。大多数玻璃妄想症的病例会升级为极端偏执症，因为受影响的生物四面受敌，有人告诉它一些它“知道”不是真的事情，这经常使得他们难以接近接受治疗。",

	"{@b Contracting:} Glass Delusion sometimes occurs after a creature drinks a faulty potion. Black market love potions are notorious for this, but other potions that involve transmutation or mind-altering magic are also known culprits. Wicked creatures such as hags sometimes intentionally create draughts that induce this effect and use it to torment their foes.

	"{@b Treatment:} The key to treating Glass Delusion is in the mind. Magic that heals diseases doesn't work, although magic that cures indefinite madness does. Other mind-altering magics can also be used to improvise a cure, such as most charm effects. The best method is to use magic to charm someone into thinking they've been cured or that something you are offering them is an effective remedy. For example, using Charm Person to get a deluded patient to trust you and take the medicine or spell you offer them, or using Modify Memory to implant a false memory of being cured. This magically empowered placebo is a good remedy for a magic-caused delusion, but requires a bit of improvisation and creativity. If the affected creature learns afterwards that they were charmed, they remain cured.": "{@b Treatment:}治疗玻璃幻觉的关键在于心灵。能够治愈疾病的魔法无效，但能够治愈无限疯狂的魔法有效。其他改变心智的魔法也可以被用来 improvisation 治疗，比如大多数魅惑效果。最好的方法是使用魔法迷惑某人，让他们相信自己已经被治愈，或者你提供的东西是有效的疗法。例如，使用魅惑人类术让一个被幻觉困扰的患者相信你并服用你提供的药物或法术，或者使用修改记忆术植入一个虚假的治愈记忆。这种魔法赋能的安慰剂是治疗魔法引起的幻觉的良方，但需要一些即兴和创造力。如果受影响的生物事后得知自己被迷惑，他们仍然保持治愈状态。",

	"Stage 2: After 48 hours, the vine growth becomes larger. The afflicted creature can use the thorns to bolster its unarmed strikes using a covered part of its body. These thorns count as a natural weapon, dealing piercing damage equal to 1d4 + the creature's strength modifier. The vine begins to sap the vitality of its host. The creature requires twice the normal amount of food and water, and must spend at least 1 hour in direct sunlight each day to be considered properly nourished.": "阶段2：48小时后，藤蔓生长变得更加茂盛。受影响的生物可以利用藤蔓上的刺来强化其使用身体覆盖部分进行的徒手攻击。这些刺被视为一种自然武器，造成穿刺伤害，伤害值为1d4 + 该生物的力量调整值。藤蔓开始吸取宿主的活力。生物需要两倍于正常的食物和水，并且每天至少需在直射阳光下待上1小时，才能被视为得到适当的滋养。",
	"Stage 3: After 72 hours, the vine growth covers roughly a quarter of the afflicted creature's body. The afflicted creature gains the ability to speak with and understand Plant type creatures within 10ft of it as if they shared a language. Additionally, if the Plant has an intelligence score of 5 or lower, it is nonhostile to the afflicted creature and will ignore it unless provoked. Whenever the afflicted creature regains hitpoints and is not in direct sunlight, the amount of hitpoints it regains is halved (minimum of 1 hitpoint).": "第三阶段：经过72小时，藤蔓生长覆盖了受影响生物大约四分之一的身体。受影响的生物获得了与距离其10英尺内的植物型生物交谈和理解的能力，就好像它们共享一种语言一样。此外，如果植物的智力得分为5或更低，它对受影响的生物是非敌对的，并且除非受到挑衅，否则会忽视它。每当受影响的生物恢复生命值且不处于直射阳光下时，其恢复的生命值减半（最少为1点生命值）。",
	"Stage 4: After 96 hours, the vine growth covers over half of the afflicted creature's body. The creature gains the ability to communicate simple ideas with nonmagical plants, such as significant events from the last day, any active threats in the area, or whether a plant is toxic. The creature gains no special ability to influence plants in this way. In addition, the creature can cause the vine growth to grow over armour it is wearing when it finishes a short rest in direct sunlight. The piercing damage of its thorns increases by 1d4, and its armour class can't be less than 13. The afflicted creature also has advantage on ability checks to hide in or around foliage. The thorns on its body are now contagious and capable of transmitting Shroud Vine to other creatures.": "第四阶段：在96小时后，藤蔓生长覆盖了受影响生物身体的一半以上。生物获得与非魔法植物交流简单思想的能力，比如最近一天的重要事件、周围的威胁或者植物是否有毒。生物在这方面没有特殊影响植物的能力。此外，当生物在直射阳光下完成短暂休息时，可以使藤蔓生长覆盖其穿戴的盔甲。其荆棘的穿刺伤害增加1d4，盔甲等级不低于13。受影响的生物还在植被内或周围隐藏时具有优势的能力检定。其身体上的荆棘现在具有传染性，能够传播给其他生物。",
	"Stage 5: After 120 hours, the disease finally begins to kill the afflicted creature. Once stage 5 is reached, the target's hitpoint maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the maximum value of its hit die every hour. When the creature's hitpoint maximum is reduced to zero, it dies.": "第5阶段：在120小时后，疾病终于开始杀死受影响的生物。一旦达到第5阶段，目标的生命值上限每小时减少相当于其最大生命骰的最大值。当生物的生命值上限降低到零时，它就会死亡。",
	"The creature instinctively knows that it is dying, and feels a strange compulsion to rest in areas of direct sunlight. If the creature is in an area of direct sunlight, it refuses to leave that area unless compelled by magic. Once the creature dies, a Shroud Vine bush sprouts from its body after 24 hours in the approximate size and shape of the dead creature.": "这种生物本能地知道自己正在死去，并感到一种奇怪的冲动，想要休息在直射阳光的地方。如果生物处于直射阳光的区域，它会拒绝离开那个区域，除非受到魔法的驱使。一旦生物死亡，24小时后，一株(Shroud Vine)藤蔓从它的尸体上生长出来，大约与死去生物的尸体大小和形状相近。",
	"{@b Contracting:} The only ways to contract Shroud Vine are either through contact with a Shroud Vine bush or a creature in the late stages (Stage 4 or 5) of an infection. In either case, even a light scratch of the thorns can induce infection, with such a superficial injury being easily overlooked until visible symptoms set in. In the case of bushes, since they grow over the corpses of other victims, looters are often scratched when drawn to the belongings of the dead. Shroud Vine bushes appear in rough silhouettes of the creatures they killed, forming eerie shadows or humanoids and beasts. These bushes occur in the forests on the material plane in all biomes but are rare except where cultivated by especially isolated druids, in the feywild where they can form small groves and are weaponised by hags, and even in the Abyss, most notably Demogorgon's realm of the Gaping Maw. A creature scratched by a Shroud Vine must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, becoming infected on a failure. A creature that succeeds on this save is immune for the next 24 hours.": "{@b Contracting:} 与 Shroud Vine 感染的唯一途径是接触 Shroud Vine 灌木或处于感染晚期（第4或第5阶段）的生物。在任何情况下，即使轻微划伤荆棘也可能导致感染，这种表面伤口很容易被忽视，直到出现明显症状。在灌木的情况下，由于它们生长在其他受害者的尸体上，掠夺者在被死者的财物吸引时经常被划伤。Shroud Vine 灌木呈现出它们杀死的生物的粗略轮廓，形成怪异的阴影或人形和野兽。这些灌木出现在物质位面的森林中的所有生物群系中，但除了被特别隔离的德鲁伊栽培的地方外，它们很少见，在仙界中它们可以形成小树林，并被女巫用作武器，甚至在深渊中，尤其是 Demogorgon 的领域 Gaping Maw 中也有。被 Shroud Vine 划伤的生物必须进行一次 DC 13 的体质豁免才能避免感染。成功豁免的生物在接下来的24小时内免疫。",

	"Attempting to cure the disease without removing the vines simply slows its growth, preventing progress to the next stage for 24 hours, and this technique is used by people who want to reap certain benefits from the disease such as the ability to talk to plants. If a creature's Shroud Vine infection is prevented from progressing for 30 days, it becomes symbiotic, and doesn't progress any further.": "试图治愈疾病而不移除藤蔓只会减缓其生长，阻止其进入下一阶段24小时，并且这种技术被一些人用来从这种疾病中获得特定好处，比如与植物交谈的能力。如果一个生物的(Shroud Vine)感染被阻止进展30天，它将变得共生，并且不会再进一步发展。",

These bulbs are very fragile and burst on contact, spraying anything nearby with acid and Blightpuff spores. There are two varieties of Bursting Blightpuff, distinguished mainly by the colour of their acid bulbs, orange and green. Orange Blightpuff can be found deep underground, so Blightpus infections run rampant in communities of certain underdark creatures like troglodytes and gricks, and Myconids also cultivate it as a deterrent against intruders around their territory. Green Blightpuff is much rarer, and grows in wet forests and swamps, thriving in the territory of black dragons. A patch of Blightpuff covers at least a 10ft square area but can often be much larger.

The leaves are circular and about 1 ft in diameter, with a tiny ridge of teeth around the circumference that usually sit just below the waterline. Usually Pond Snare grows in clusters which can blot out small ponds if prevalent enough, and while they grow in water a few feet deep, they can also grow to be up to 50ft long from root to leaf.

Living in warm tropical seas, they root down on both on the shoreline, around rockpools that are flooded by the tide, and in coral reefs. Their preference for warm water usually means they live in relatively shallow water or near volcanic vents. Their base is a squat cylinder patterned with bright red and white swirls with a swarm of almost translucent white tendrils emerging from within. Young Scylla's Claw have tendrils a few inches long, while older ones can have tendrils extending up to two feet.

	"A naturally-occurring phenomenon on the ocean floor, where extremely high concentrations of salt create pools of high-density brine that sink in water and create lakes within oceans, with their own surface and shoreline. These brine pools are toxic to most marine life, and usually form near certain high deposits of salt in nearby rocks, where depressions in the sea floor shelter the pools from ocean currents that would disturb them. Most aquatic creatures shun these toxic wastelands, but some folk like sahuagin and sea hags use the natural formations as defence against attackers, while others such as Wastriliths who can survive the salinity can live freely within their depths.

When enough Manes are slaughtered in one location, these clouds can become thick enough to block vision and choke living things, and worse things still. Clouds of this sort occur on demonic battlefields in both the lower planes and the sites of demonic incursions to other realms. Often these clouds form pits of mud or slime beneath them as they coalesce into new Manes, first as ichor then slowly attaining shape and flesh, with blood and bodily fluids soaking into the soil or gathering into sticky pools on hard surfaces.

	"A basic trap often used by smugglers and thieves in coastal areas due to how simple it is to create. This basic tripwire is augmented by the addition of several large barbed hooks normally used for fishing. These hooks aren't very dangerous but are difficult and painful to remove. A string of fish hooks is usually hidden by low foliage or buried in soft sand, or inside a narrow opening such as a crawlspace or treasure stash. Since simple fish hooks aren't likely to stop an intruder in their tracks, these hooks are usually attached to a bell or some other alarm, or are attached to a discreet seal of some kind (such as paper or wax) that breaks when the line is pulled on to leave evidence of tampering.": "在沿海地区，走私者和小偷经常使用的一种基本陷阱，因为它非常简单易制作。这种基本的绊索陷阱通过添加几个通常用于捕鱼的大型带刺钩来增强。这些钩子并不是非常危险，但很难且痛苦地取出。一串鱼钩通常隐藏在低矮的植被中，或埋在松软的沙土中，或者藏在狭窄的开口处，比如爬行空间或宝藏储藏处。由于简单的鱼钩不太可能阻止入侵者，这些钩子通常连接到一个铃铛或其他警报器上，或者连接到一种离开痕迹的离线密封物（如纸张或蜡），当拉动绳索时会破裂以留下篡改证据。",
