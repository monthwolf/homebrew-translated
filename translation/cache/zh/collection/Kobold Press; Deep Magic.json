	"Too many arcane spellcasters and scholars view alchemy as magic's poor second cousin—an academic pursuit with practical applications, but still nothing that wizards with real talent would devote serious time or effort to. While alchemy can achieve astounding, even nearly miraculous feats, it's always been overshadowed by the power and versatility of arcane magic. Because alchemy requires extensive preparation and forethought, adventurers tend to prefer the flexibility and immediacy of spellcasting.": "许多奥术施法者和学者认为炼金术只是魔法的次等亲戚——一种具有实际应用的学术追求，但仍然不是真正有才华的巫师会花费大量时间和精力去专研的。虽然炼金术可以实现令人惊讶甚至近乎奇迹般的壮举，但它一直被奥术魔法的力量和多样性所掩盖。由于炼金术需要大量的准备和思考，冒险者们往往更喜欢施法的灵活性和即时性。",
	"In some areas, a branch of alchemy is practiced that surpasses the simple alchemy familiar to the rest of the world. Known as magical chemistry, or simply alkemancy, this discipline delves into the properties of common alchemical substances, such as brimstone and salt, and the means by which they can be used to achieve physical and metaphysical transformation in objects and creatures on levels unseen in most lands. Alkemancy practitioners combine their understanding of alchemical reagents and elixirs with their knowledge of spellcraft to create new and formidable magical effects.": "在一些地区，存在一种超越世界其他地方熟知的简单炼金术的炼金分支。被称为魔法化学，或简称为炼金术，这门学科探讨常见炼金物质（如硫磺和盐）的属性，以及它们如何被用来在物体和生物上实现物理和形而上的转化，这在大多数土地上是看不到的。炼金术师将他们对炼金试剂和药剂的理解与他们对咒术的知识相结合，创造出新的、强大的魔法效果。",
	"Even more than this, though, alkemancy embodies a unique philosophy of life and nature. Alkemancers don't concoct useful potions and philters as an end in itself. Ultimately, they seek to expand their minds past mortal limits, or even to achieve true immortality, and alkemancy is simply the path they follow in pursuit of that goal.": "甚至比这更重要的是，炼金术体现了一种独特的生活和自然哲学。炼金术师并非仅仅为了调制有用的药剂和过滤剂而存在。最终，他们追求超越凡人极限的思想，甚至实现真正的永生，而炼金术只是他们在追求这一目标过程中所遵循的路径。",
	"Transmuters and alkemancers belong to similar schools of thought. But where transmuters have little use for alchemy and its secrets, preferring to rely on brute magical force to achieve their aims—at least, that's the opinion held by traditional alchemists—alkemancers combine extensive knowledge of alchemy with the many ways that the six fundamental essences can be applied to arcane magic.": "变形术师和炼金术士属于类似的思想流派。但是，变形术师对炼金术及其秘密几乎没有用处，更倾向于依靠强大的魔法力量来实现他们的目标——至少，这是传统炼金术士所持有的观点——而炼金术士结合了对炼金术的广泛知识以及六种基本精华如何应用于奥术魔法的多种方式。",
	"The power of alkemancy resides within the six fundamental essences: brimstone, lead, quicksilver, quintessence, salt, and void salt. These essences parallel the four standard elements, as well as the two more esoteric elements of metal and void, but are unique to alchemy.": "炼金术的力量存在于六种基本本质之中：硫磺、铅、水银、第五元素、盐和虚空盐。这些本质与四大标准元素以及金属和虚空这两种更神秘的元素相对应，但是它们是独特于炼金术的。",
	"The yellow of brimstone (otherwise known as sulfur) represents activity, energy, and masculinity, and it's related to the sun, volcanoes, and elemental fire. Brimstone is a destructive essence present in small amounts in explosives, various acids, and in substances such as {@item alchemist's fire (flask)|phb|alchemist's fire}.": "硫磺（又称为硫）的黄色代表着活力、能量和男性气质，与太阳、火山和元素火相关。硫磺是一种破坏性的精华，在爆炸物、各种酸和诸如{@item alchemist's fire (flask)|phb|alchemist's fire}等物质中以少量存在。",
	"Also erroneously referred to as antimony (a different metal that lead is sometimes combined with), lead represents coldness and heaviness, transformation, and the removal of impurities in objects and creatures. It is associated with broader elemental metals and is often called the oldest or first metal. Lead is reactive and can be toxic in various forms over long periods of exposure—useful qualities in lingering poisons and slow-acting corrosives. It's used as a component in many alchemical creations and supplies.": "有时被错误地称为锑(与铅有时混合在一起的另一种金属)，铅代表着冷静和沉重，变革，以及去除物体和生物中的杂质。它与更广泛的元素金属相关，并经常被称为最古老或第一种金属。铅具有反应性，在长时间暴露下以各种形式可能具有毒性——这些特质在残留毒药和缓慢腐蚀剂中非常有用。它被用作许多炼金创作和补给品中的组成部分。",
	"Also known as mercury, this silvery metal represents passivity, femininity, and malleability. It's associated with elemental water and the moon. Quicksilver is seen as a creative essence despite its passive nature. It's also a lethal poison, much faster-acting than lead, for example. A fluid dram of refined quicksilver is occasionally used in vials of both alchemical poisons and antitoxins.": "也被称为水银，这种银白色金属代表着被动性、女性特质和可塑性。它与水元素和月亮有关。尽管水银被视为一种被动的本质，但也被看作是一种创造性的要素。它也是一种致命的毒药，比如比铅更快速地发挥作用。精制水银的流量很少被用于炼金毒药和解毒剂的小瓶中。",
	"One of the rarest and most mysterious of the six fundamental essences, quintessence represents thought, life, and spirit. It is distantly related to elemental air; in its commonest form, it appears as a vaporous, silvery liquid. Quintessence is never used in common alchemical items, largely because it's one of the most difficult of the essences to obtain and it dissipates as soon as it's exposed to air. Alkemancers are always keen to find viable substitutes for quintessence in their concoctions.": "六大基本本质之一，精华代表着思想、生命和精神，是最稀有和神秘的之一。它与元素空气有着遥远的联系；在最常见的形式下，它呈现为一种蒸气状的银色液体。精华从不用于常见的炼金物品中，主要是因为它是最难获取的本质之一，一旦暴露在空气中就会消散。炼金术士们总是渴望在他们的配方中找到可替代精华的替代品。",
	"The most common of the six fundamental essences is salt, which represents matter, physicality, and the human body. It is closely related to elemental earth. Purified salt is used in many common alchemical items, and solutions of salt are used widely in mundane and supernatural formulas and rituals.": "六种基本精华中最常见的是盐，代表物质、物质性和人体。它与元素土密切相关。纯化的盐被用于许多常见的炼金物品，盐溶液被广泛用于日常和超自然配方和仪式中。",
	"Dull black crystals distilled from the blood of slain creatures of the Void, the substance known as Void salt takes its name from its granular appearance. Void salt is associated with dissolution, entropy, and madness. It is a dangerous substance to work with, because merely touching it with bare skin deals 1 necrotic damage. Anyone intending to work with Void salt should wear gloves of metal or thick leather, and even those substances corrode soon after coming in contact with Void salt unless they're protected with an anti-necrotic energy coating. The use of Void salt is reserved for rare alchemical concoctions, mainly acids, poisons, and explosives.": "从虚空生物的鲜血中提炼出来的暗黑晶体，被称为虚空盐的物质因其颗粒状外观而得名。虚空盐与溶解、熵和疯狂有关。这是一种危险的物质，因为光是用裸露的皮肤接触就会造成1点死灵伤害。任何打算使用虚空盐的人都应该戴着金属或厚皮手套，即使是这些物质在接触虚空盐后不久也会腐蚀，除非它们被防死灵能量涂层保护。虚空盐的使用仅限于稀有的炼金混合物，主要是酸、毒药和爆炸物。",
	"Most alkemancy spells reside on the {@class wizard} spell list. The {@class sorcerer} and the {@class warlock} also have access to a smattering of alkemancy magic.": "大多数炼金术法术位于{@class wizard}法术清单上。{@class sorcerer}和{@class warlock}也能够使用少量的炼金术魔法。",

	"The heavenly planes shine with light and power, as deities both benevolent and stern look down from their thrones. Without question, the most powerful of those gods' servants are the angels. Angels carry the word of their creators to mortal ears and bring down their righteous blades against creatures of darkness. These entities are mighty beyond mortal ken, and their very names seethe with the essence of creation. The secrets of harnessing the power of the angels are hidden within those names, and a select few mortals have learned how to realize that potential.": "天堂位面闪耀着光芒和力量，善良和严厉的神祇俯视着他们的王座。毫无疑问，这些神祇中最强大的仆人就是天使。天使将他们创造者的话语传达给凡人，并用他们正义的利刃对抗黑暗生物。这些存在远超凡人所能理解，他们的名字本身就充满了创世本质。掌握天使力量的秘密隐藏在这些名字之中，只有少数凡人学会了如何发挥这种潜力。",
	"The first angelic seals and wards were passed to worthy mortals as rewards for their sacrifice and valor in the service of light, and as weapons to be used in the struggle against the fiendish hordes. An angelic seal is the written form of the true name of an angel, inscribed on an object or a surface in a particular way to draw on the essence of that angel's power. That power flows through the written representation and into the individual who carries it, or into a location that bears a ward. The angel isn't harmed or hindered when a fraction of its power is siphoned this way, but it does notice, and woe befalls any wicked soul who steals the secret of a seal and misuses its power.": "最初的天使印章和结界被赋予值得的凡人，作为他们为光明服务中的牺牲和勇气的奖励，也作为对抗邪恶军团的斗争中使用的武器。天使印章是天使真名的书写形式，以特定方式刻在物体或表面上，以汲取天使力量的本质。这种力量通过书面表现流向携带它的个体，或者流向带有结界的地点。当以这种方式吸取其力量的一部分时，天使不会受到伤害或阻碍，但它会注意到，任何邪恶灵魂窃取印章的秘密并滥用其力量的人都会遭受不幸。",
	"Seals and wards aren't the only expressions of angelic power available to mortals.

Taking unformed matter and shaping it to conform to one's will is an effective way of blending the physical and arcane arts. The dwarves' greatest magic has come from this effort, as evidenced by the legendary weapons, armor, and implements of war that emerge from their mountain strongholds. Few dwarves pursue the study of magic aside from devotion to their deities, but one discipline bridges the gap between creation and spellcasting: ring magic.": "矮人以塑造物质世界而闻名。土地、石头和金属都顺从于矮人锤子的意志。很容易假设矮人在塑造材料方面有如此高超的技能，他们就没有时间和精力成为奥术大师，但这种假设是错误的。将未成形的物质塑造成符合自己意志的方式是融合物质和奥术艺术的有效方法。矮人最伟大的魔法正是来自这种努力，正如从他们的山寨中涌现出的传奇武器、盔甲和战争工具所证明的那样。除了对他们的神明的奉献之外，很少有矮人追求魔法的研究，但有一门学科弥合了创造和施法之间的鸿沟：戒指魔法。",

	"Every archmage needs someone to clean dishes, tend to meals, and wash bedpans. Although some wizards use spells or servants to perform these duties, others give these jobs to their apprentices, budding wizards they have taken under their wings to learn the esteemed art of magic.

	"Lereilel was born into an affluent family and displayed an affinity for magic when she came of age—much to the chagrin of her socialite mother, who constantly expressed her disappointment that Lereilel had taken after her father's looks and whims. Although she was discouraged by her mother's disapproval and the mirthful stares of the men her mother brought to woo her, Lereilel eventually convinced her father to let her study magic under the tutelage of Ravin Wyrdstone. Since then, Lereilel has worked hard to prove herself but still thinks that her appearance holds her back. She has faith that the transmutation magic she is studying might hold the key to \"correcting\" her unsightly looks and finally make her mother proud of her.": "莱蕾尔(Lereilel)出生在一个富裕家庭，当她成年时展现出对魔法的亲和力——这让她那位社交名媛母亲感到非常不悦，母亲经常表达对莱蕾尔像父亲一样外貌和怪念头的失望。尽管她受到母亲的反对和母亲带来追求她的男士们的嬉笑注视，莱蕾尔最终说服父亲让她在雷文·怀德斯通(Ravin Wyrdstone)的指导下学习魔法。从那时起，莱蕾尔努力工作以证明自己，但仍然认为自己的外表阻碍了她。她相信她正在学习的变形魔法可能是“纠正”她不雅外貌并最终让母亲为她感到骄傲的关键。",
	"Recently, Lereilel has been seeing Thaliydor Brightcrest, a handsome half-elf and a local carpenter who seems to think the world of her despite her homeliness. Unfortunately for her, Lereilel does not realize she is being duped and that Thaliydor is actually an assassin (CE male half-elf 5th-level rogue) who is using her to get closer to her master.": "最近，莱瑞蕾尔（Lereilel）开始和萨利多·布莱特克雷斯特（Thaliydor Brightcrest）约会，他是一位英俊的半精灵，也是当地的木匠，尽管她相貌平平，但他似乎对她非常看重。不幸的是，莱瑞蕾尔并没有意识到自己被欺骗，萨利多实际上是一名刺客（中立邪恶男性半精灵5级游荡者），他利用她接近她的主人。",
	"Loreilel is highly intelligent and well versed in arcane lore, but finds it difficult to speak with people and has been something of a wallflower throughout her life. As such, she can easily be taken advantage of by someone who gives her any attention, particularly if that person is both attractive and charming. If Lereilel realizes that Thaliydor's feelings are false, the last shreds of her confidence might finally break, leading her to do something potentially self-destructive unless someone steps in to save her.": "Loreilel（洛瑞蕾尔）非常聪明，精通奥术知识，但她发现很难与人交流，在她的一生中一直是个墙角花。因此，她很容易被那些给予她关注的人利用，特别是如果那个人既有魅力又很迷人的话。如果Lereilel（洛瑞蕾尔）意识到Thaliydor（萨利多）的感情是虚假的，她最后的自信可能会彻底崩溃，导致她做出潜在的自我毁灭行为，除非有人介入拯救她。",
	"One easy way for the characters to become involved with Lereilel is to have them hired by her master as guards. Ravin is concerned that he might be the target of an assassination attempt by an old enemy and wants the characters to protect him and his apprentice until he can track down the villain. Strangely, the archmage is more concerned about Lereilel than he is about himself and tells the characters to watch her carefully. Alternatively, they could be hired by Lereilel's father to check on his daughter and see how she is doing. Regardless of how the characters become involved, their arrival puts a major chink in Thaliydor's plans and forces the assassin's hand, as the half-elf hires a band of evil brigands to deal with the characters while he uses Lereilel as bait to make an attempt on the life of her master.": "一个让角色与莱瑞蕾尔（Lereilel）有所牵扯的简单方法是让她的主人雇佣他们作为护卫。拉文（Ravin）担心自己可能成为一名老敌人暗杀的目标，希望角色们保护他和他的学徒，直到他能找到那个恶棍。奇怪的是，大法师更关心莱瑞蕾尔而不是自己，并告诉角色们要仔细观察她。或者，他们可以被莱瑞蕾尔的父亲雇佣来查看他的女儿，看看她的情况如何。无论角色们如何参与，他们的到来都给萨利多（Thaliydor）的计划带来了重大变数，并迫使刺客出手，因为这位半精灵雇佣了一群邪恶的强盗来对付角色们，同时利用莱瑞蕾尔作为诱饵，试图对她的主人下手。",

	"Terindor Grayveil (CG male human 1st-level wizard) is a wiry lad of fifteen with unruly orange hair and deep blue eyes. An earnest and helpful soul, Terindor is also far smarter than most of the adults around him and has taken to the study of magic with natural aplomb. His master is Elgretta Mathelzor (LG female human 14th-level wizard [evoker]), a famous war wizard who is often away on military campaigns, leaving Terindor to fend for himself.": "Terindor Grayveil (混沌善良 男性 人类 1级法师) 是一个身材瘦弱的十五岁少年，头发蓬乱的橙色，深蓝色的眼睛。Terindor 是一个真诚而乐于助人的灵魂，他比周围大多数成年人都聪明，天生具备学习魔法的才华。他的导师是 Elgretta Mathelzor (守序善良 女性 人类 14级法师 [咒术师])，一位著名的战争法师，经常在军事战役中离开，让 Terindor 自己照料自己。",
	"Terindor was born to hard-working but luckless mercantile parents who gave everything they had to make the lives of their children better, even teaching them letters and history to help them establish themselves in the world. The family became crippled by debt, and rather than seeing her parents cast out onto the streets, Terindor's sister, Ileena, agreed to marry a lecherous noble in order to save the family business. Shortly thereafter, Terindor sought out the war wizard and begged to become her apprentice—a move that shocked his mother and father, even more so when Elgretta agreed. Since then, Terindor has worked hard at his training, moving forward in leaps and bounds even though his master is frequently absent.": "泰林多(Terindor)出生在勤劳但不幸的商人父母之家，他们为了让孩子们过上更好的生活而付出了一切，甚至教他们识字和历史，帮助他们在世界上立足。这个家庭因债务而陷入困境，泰林多的姐姐伊琳娜(Ileena)为了不让父母被赶出家门，同意嫁给一个好色的贵族，以拯救家族生意。不久之后，泰林多寻找了战争法师，并请求成为她的学徒——这一举动震惊了他的父母，更让埃尔格蕾塔(Elgretta)同意了。从那时起，泰林多努力地进行训练，取得了长足的进步，尽管他的导师经常不在身边。",
	"Terindor is a determined lad who consistently pushes himself to become a better wizard. While maintaining this focus, he frequently pauses his studies to help out those in need, whether by fixing the roof of a spinster's cottage or driving out giant rats from the local brewery. Well-liked by those in his community, he is also the only one not awestruck by his mistress, who is renowned for her success in singlehandedly destroying a horde of goblins and felling a mighty white dragon with a barrage of spells.": "泰林多尔(Terindor)是一个坚定的年轻人，他始终努力成为一名更优秀的巫师。在保持这种专注的同时，他经常中断学习来帮助那些需要帮助的人，无论是修理老处女小屋的屋顶，还是驱赶当地酿酒厂的巨鼠。他受到社区人们的喜爱，也是唯一一个不为他的女主人所惊叹的人，她以独自摧毁一群地精并用一连串法术击倒一只强大的白龙而闻名。",
	"Terindor's main reason for wanting to become stronger is to free Ileena from her forced marriage. Although he knows that Elgretta sympathizes with him, she has told him quite bluntly that seeking retribution against the noble is wrong and not something she can be part of.": "泰林多（Terindor）想变得更强大的主要原因是为了解救伊琳娜（Ileena）免于被迫婚姻。尽管他知道艾尔格蕾塔（Elgretta）对他表示同情，但她却很直率地告诉他，寻求对贵族报复是错误的，也不是她愿意参与的事情。",
	"While he is training, Terindor keeps his ear to the ground in the community for talk of passing adventurers, particularly those who don't care about breaking the rules but are still fundamentally good at heart. If he hears of the characters' deeds, he approaches them at his first opportunity and expresses his desire to help his sister out of her predicament. Terindor has nothing to give the characters in payment but promises to help them enchant their gear when he becomes a more powerful wizard. If the characters seem about to refuse his request, he offers them the services of Elgretta—a promise that he knows might cause him a lot of trouble in the future.": "在训练时，泰林多尔（Terindor）时刻留意社区中有关过往冒险者的传闻，尤其是那些虽然不拘小节，但内心仍然善良的人。如果他听说了角色们的事迹，他会在第一时间接近他们，并表达希望帮助他的姐姐摆脱困境的愿望。泰林多尔没有任何报酬可以给角色们，但承诺在他成为更强大的巫师后帮助他们给装备施加魔法。如果角色们似乎要拒绝他的请求，他会提供他的姐姐艾尔格蕾塔（Elgretta）的服务——他知道这个承诺可能会给他未来带来很多麻烦。",

	"Erolimar (LG male elf 1st-level wizard) is a young elf with sweeping silvery locks and amethyst eyes. Stout of limb, graceful and handsome, Erolimar seems almost like the perfect elf—yet despite these qualities, he has been cursed with only middling intelligence and wisdom, making him a poor choice as a wizard's apprentice. Nevertheless, he has been taken on by Taramind the Scorched (NE elf male 15th-level wizard [conjurer]), a mysterious elf with hideously burned features who is known for his dealings with elementals and fiends.": "Erolimar（LG 男性精灵1级法师）是一位年轻的精灵，拥有银色长发和紫晶般的眼睛。四肢粗壮，优雅英俊，Erolimar看起来几乎是完美的精灵——然而尽管拥有这些品质，他却被诅咒，智慧和智力只是中等水平，使他成为一个不太理想的法师学徒。尽管如此，他已被Taramind the Scorched（NE 男性精灵15级法师[召唤师]）收为门徒。Taramind是一位神秘的精灵，面容被严重烧伤，以与元素和恶魔打交道而闻名。",
	"Erolimar comes from a long line of accomplished spellcasters. Indeed, it was expected that young Erolimar would enroll at an esteemed college of magic when he came of age so he could follow in his forebears' footsteps. This would have been the case, had he passed the entrance exam. Soon, it became clear that Erolimar was not the paragon of wizardry his father and mother thought he would be. Dejected, he turned his back on magic to pursue the meaningful but far less prestigious role of hunter for his village.": "Erolimar（Erolimar）来自一系列杰出的咒术师。事实上，人们期望年轻的Erolimar在成年后能够就读一所著名的魔法学院，以便继承祖辈的遗志。如果他通过了入学考试，情况本应如此。很快，Erolimar并非他的父母所期望的巫术楷模这一事实变得清晰。受挫之后，他放弃了魔法，转而选择了为村庄担任猎人这一有意义但声望远低的角色。",
	"Just when it seemed that magic had left Erolimar behind, he was saved by Taramind, who approached the young elf to be his apprentice. At first fearful of the wizard's reputation, Erolimar finally accepted the offer and has taken to his new position with gusto, unaware that his master has taken him on to prepare Erolimar's soul for sacrifice to a fiend, whose life force he will then transfer into the young elf 's body.": "就在似乎魔法已经抛弃了埃罗利玛的时候，他被塔拉敏救了，后者走近这位年轻的精灵，希望他成为自己的学徒。一开始害怕这位巫师的名声，埃罗利玛最终接受了这个提议，并充满热情地担任起新职位，却不知道他的主人希望准备将埃罗利玛的灵魂献祭给一位恶魔，然后将恶魔的生命力转移到这位年轻精灵的身体中。",
	"Erolimar is a kind-hearted, generous, and naive individual who does not see a bad bone in anyone around him. Even Taramind, with his menacing demeanor and harsh teaching methods, does not set off Erolimar's alarm bells; he prefers to focus on his master's strengths, rather than than worry about his flaws. Erolimar is envied by many in his village for his good looks and natural agility, but they are also aware of his failings, and there are few who can hold a bad thought in their hearts for the elf for too long.": "Erolimar是一个善良、慷慨、天真的个体，他看不到周围任何人的坏心眼。即使是Taramind，以他威胁的态度和严厉的教学方法，也无法引起Erolimar的警觉；他更愿意专注于他主人的优点，而不是担心他的缺点。Erolimar因为英俊和天赋出众而被他村庄的许多人所羡慕，但他们也意识到他的缺点，很少有人能够对这位精灵心怀恶念太久。",
	"The characters are hired by the local elf population to investigate a spate of bizarre animal attacks in the vicinity of Taramind's mansion. The attacks have been violent and erratic, the animals in question extremely vicious and difficult to kill. During their investigation, the characters run into Erolimar, and the elf proves to be helpful on more than one occasion. Eventually (perhaps with Erolimar's help), they realize that the animals have become possessed by lesser fiends and that some sort of conjuration magic is responsible. It is at this point when Taramind begins to prepare the young elf for sacrifice, and it is up to the characters to save him. How this plays out is up to the GM, but Taramind is no pushover—his mansion is home to magic traps, bound fiends, and terrible golems.": "人物们被当地精灵族群雇佣，调查塔拉明庄园附近一系列奇怪的动物袭击事件。这些袭击行为既暴力又不规律，相关动物极为凶残且难以击败。在调查过程中，人物们遇到了埃洛利玛(Erolimar)，这位精灵在多个场合上都证明了自己的帮助性。最终（也许在埃洛利玛的帮助下），他们意识到这些动物已经被次级恶魔附身，某种召唤魔法是罪魁祸首。就在这时，塔拉明开始准备年轻精灵进行祭祀，而人物们则需要拯救他。这场戏如何发展取决于GM，但塔拉明并不是好对付的——他的庄园里设有魔法陷阱、被束缚的恶魔和可怕的魔像。",
	"I was a warrior before I became a wizard, a sword for hire who traveled the world looking for adventure. I made a name for myself as well. Perhaps you've heard of me? Arn's the name—Arn of Rowan.": "在我成为巫师之前，我是一名战士，一名雇佣剑客，周游世界寻找冒险。我也为自己赢得了声誉。也许你听说过我？我的名字是Arn—Rowan的Arn。",
	"Arn of Rowan (CN male human 12th-level fighter/2nd-level wizard) is a strapping man in his mid-thirties with long brown hair, a thick beard, and piercing black eyes. Tall and full of vigor, Arn seems like an odd choice for a wizard's apprentice, and his master, Jainara Meadowwands (LN female human 9th-level wizard [illusionist]), seems more like a harried wife than a teacher. Indeed, most people find their pairing to be odd, especially given that Arn is much more famous than his master.": "罗文的阿恩（混乱中立 男性 人类 12级战士/2级法师）是一个三十多岁的健壮男子，长着长长的棕色头发，浓密的胡须和炯炯有神的黑眼睛。高大而充满活力，阿恩似乎是一个奇怪的巫师学徒选择，而他的导师，梅多旺兹的贾娜拉（法师幻术师 混乱中立 女性 人类 9级），看起来更像一个忙碌的妻子而不是一位老师。事实上，大多数人都觉得他们的搭配很奇怪，尤其是考虑到阿恩比他的导师更有名。",
	"Arn began his career as a soldier in the army of a self-righteous duke who waged war against his neighbors under the pretense of dispensing justice. It was during this bloody time that Arn solidified his reputation as a vicious fighter with axe and shield, and once the duke had his fill of warfare, Arn forged his own career as a mercenary for hire, basing himself in the small town of Rowan, which he soon put on the map with his legendary exploits.": "阿恩（Arn）在一位自以为是的公爵的军队中开始了他的军旅生涯，这位公爵以分发正义为借口对邻国发动战争。正是在这段血腥的时期，阿恩以斧头和盾牌作战的凶猛声名渐起。一旦公爵厌倦了战争，阿恩便开始自己作为一名雇佣兵的职业生涯，在小镇罗文（Rowan）扎根，很快因他的传奇壮举而声名远扬。",
	"It was after one particularly harrowing mission that Arn drank too much ale at the local tavern and lost a bet to one of his companions, a bard who claimed that Arn could never master any trade but that of the blade. Haughtily, Arn took up the challenge and availed himself of the talents of Jainara Meadowwands, a mousy-haired woman and capable illusionist, agreeing to pay off her debts in exchange for becoming her pupil. Jainara accepted the deal, believing that Arn would quickly grow bored and leave—but much to her amazement, he not only stayed but quickly excelled as her student.": "在一次特别惊险的任务之后，Arn在当地酒馆喝了太多的麦酒，并输给了他的一个同伴，一个声称Arn除了剑之外永远无法掌握其他技能的吟游诗人。Arn傲慢地接受了挑战，利用了Jainara Meadowwands的才能，她是一位头发乌黑的女人，擅长幻术，同意帮助Arn还清她的债务，作为交换成为他的学徒。Jainara接受了这个交易，相信Arn会很快厌倦并离开，但令她惊讶的是，他不仅留了下来，而且很快就成为她的出色学生。",
	"Arn is a boisterous and carefree individual who has many scars and tales from his past. Naturally charismatic and with an unusually keen intellect, he would probably have been a lord by now if it were not for his chaotic nature. The fact that he is good at magecraft does not surprise Arn, since he is good at whatever he puts his mind to. What does surprise him, however, is that he actually enjoys the work. He has also grown quite fond of Jainara, and finds her presence strangely calming.": "阿恩是一个热情奔放、无忧无虑的个体，他有许多来自过去的伤疤和故事。他天生具有魅力，拥有异常敏锐的智慧，如果不是因为他混乱的本性，他现在可能已经成为一位领主了。阿恩擅长魔法也并不让他感到惊讶，因为无论他做什么，他都很擅长。然而，让他感到惊讶的是，他竟然真的喜欢这项工作。他也对贾娜拉产生了深厚的感情，发现她的存在竟然让他感到奇妙的平静。",
	"The characters are passing through the area when Rowan is attacked by a flight of wyvern-riding hobgoblins. Arn and Jainara are also present, and through their combined efforts they and the characters manage to turn back the attack. Jainara is injured during the fight, and it is at this stage that Arn decides to turn his back on the blade and try being a wizard full-time. Of course, being Arn of Rowan, he cannot let the culprits get away with hurting his master, so he offers the PCs his magic battleaxe if they track the hobgoblins back to their base and finish them off.": "当角色们穿过这个地区时，罗温被一群骑着翼龙的地精袭击了。阿恩和贾娜拉也在场，通过他们的共同努力，他们和角色们设法击退了袭击。在战斗中，贾娜拉受伤了，就在这个时候，阿恩决定放弃剑，全心全意地成为一名巫师。当然，作为罗温的阿恩，他不能让伤害他的主人的罪犯逍遥法外，所以他向玩家角色提供他的魔法战斧，如果他们追踪地精回到他们的基地并消灭他们。",

She also has a large, reddish birthmark on her left shoulder that she normally keeps hidden under her robes. Xelasora is serious and humble and possesses a razor-sharp mind. Her master is Dramothir Galefnir (LG male dwarf 12th-level wizard [abjurer]), who in addition to being a learned mage is also a renowned artisan and jeweler.": "Xelasora（LN女性龙裔1级巫师/1级法师）是一位优雅的龙裔少女，有着混合蓝色和绿色鳞片，额头上有四根向后梳的短角，以及大大的琥珀色眼睛。她的左肩上还有一个大大的红色胎记，通常被她藏在长袍下面。Xelasora是认真谦逊的，拥有一颗锋利的头脑。她的导师是Dramothir Galefnir（LG男性矮人12级法师[护卫者]），除了是一位博学的法师外，他还是一位著名的工匠和珠宝商。",
	"The youngest of seven siblings, Xelasora lived a happy childhood, until the disastrous day when a red dragon attacked her community and killed the rest of her family. Mentally and emotionally scarred by the experience, Xelasora withdrew into herself after she was placed in an orphanage. She was ostracized by the other children in the orphanage, who were mostly human and considered her little more than a monster. Eventually, her pent-up emotions boiled over and she unleashed some of her latent magic, setting fire to the clothing of one of her tormentors. This act led to her being expelled from the orphanage and forced to live on the streets, where she barely managed to stay alive by using her powers. Finally, when all hope seemed lost, Xelasora was taken in by the mage Dramothir, a dwarf who was intrigued by her intelligence and wit, and who was a natural sucker for a damsel in distress. Since then, Xelasora has done her best to be a dutiful apprentice and astutely handles Dramothir's busy schedule.": "作为七个兄弟姐妹中最小的，赛拉索拉（Xelasora）度过了一个幸福的童年，直到一天，一只红龙袭击了她的社区，杀死了她的家人。经历这场灾难后，赛拉索拉在被送进孤儿院后变得心理和情感上受到了创伤。她被孤儿院里的其他孩子排斥，他们大多是人类，认为她不过是个怪物。最终，她憋在心里的情绪爆发了，释放出了一些潜在的魔法，点燃了其中一个折磨她的人的衣服。这一举动导致她被孤儿院开除，被迫流落街头，凭借自己的力量勉强维持生计。最终，在一切希望似乎都已失去时，赛拉索拉被法师德拉莫西尔（Dramothir）收留，他是一位矮人，被她的智慧和机智所吸引，也是一个天生的救援者。从那时起，赛拉索拉尽力成为一名尽职的学徒，并聪明地处理德拉莫西尔繁忙的日程安排。",
	"Xelasora is the best student that any wizard could hope for. She pursues both her magical studies and her mundane duties with the same rigorous attention to detail and is faultless in her execution. Her poised exterior, however, conceals a tormented soul. She constantly doubts herself and is worried that she could lose control of her sorcerous abilities if she becomes flustered or upset. The deaths of her family and the trouble she faced at the orphanage also still weigh on her heavily, and lately she has been plagued with dreams of fire and shadowy flying shapes, causing her to suddenly awaken in terror.": "Xelasora (泽拉索拉) 是任何巫师都希望拥有的最优秀的学生。她对魔法研究和日常职责都保持着严谨的注意力，执行起来毫无瑕疵。然而，她镇定的外表掩盖了一个受折磨的灵魂。她经常怀疑自己，担心如果变得慌乱或沮丧，就会失去对她的巫术能力的控制。她家人的死亡和在孤儿院遭遇的困难仍然沉重地压在她心头，最近她被火焰和阴影飞行形状的梦魇困扰，导致她突然惊醒。",
	"Xelasora's magic comes from a bit of theft: in her younger days, she stole a set of scrolls from an ancient red dragon. The dragon still exists in the form of a terrible undead monstrosity, and it shares a strange link with the young dragonborn that allows the two of them to share dreams and images of their lives. By the time the characters enter the picture, the dragon is close to discovering Xelasora's location—and when it does so, it plans to slay her and recover its scrolls. Before this event comes to pass, the characters have a chance to stop it, either by destroying the dragon or somehow trapping it. Of course, defeating an undead dragon is no easy feat; depending on the characters' level, the GM might want to lead them up to the event with battles against the dragon's servants in the form of ghouls, trolls, vampires, and lesser evil dragons.": "赛拉索拉(Xelasora)的魔法源自一点偷窃：在她年轻的时候，她从一只古老的红龙那里偷走了一套卷轴。那条龙如今以可怕的不死怪物的形式存在，它与年轻的龙裔之间有着奇怪的联系，使两者能分享彼此生活的梦境和图像。当角色们出现在故事中时，这条龙已经接近发现赛拉索拉的位置——一旦发现，它计划杀死她并夺回卷轴。在这事件发生之前，角色们有机会阻止它，要么是通过摧毁这条龙，要么是以某种方式困住它。当然，打败一只不死龙并不容易；根据角色的等级，GM可能希望通过与龙的仆从——如食尸鬼、巨魔、吸血鬼和次等邪恶龙——进行战斗来引导他们迎接这一事件。",
	"Golems and similar constructs are common features in a wizard's home. The most powerful mages have access to even more dangerous and complex automatons.

	"If the GM allows the use of any of these variant familiars by player characters, it might or might not be necessary for the would-be master to start the process by casting {@spell find familiar}. Either way, a variant familiar is an actual creature (not a spirit) that serves at its own discretion, obeying its master's commands only when doing so does not immediately bring it harm, and it will not hesitate to end the link with its master as a matter of self-preservation. Unlike standard familiars, a variant familiar does not disappear if it drops to 0 hit points; it simply dies or falls unconscious (GM's choice).": "如果GM允许玩家角色使用这些变种使魔中的任何一种，那么对于准备成为使魔主人的人来说，也许需要开始通过施放{@spell find familiar}来启动这个过程，也可能不需要。无论哪种方式，变种使魔都是一个实际的生物（而非精灵），它会自行决定是否效忠于主人的命令，只有在这样做不会立即给它带来伤害时才会服从，它会毫不犹豫地终止与主人的联系以自我保护为重。与标准使魔不同，如果一个变种使魔的生命值降至0，它不会消失；它会简单地死亡或陷入昏迷（由GM决定）。",

To determine which type of madness emerges, refer to the {@table Indefinite Madness|KPDM} table.": "在未能通过豁免检定时，生物会获得1点虚空污染。生物可以累积等于其熟练加值+其魅力调整值（最少2点）的虚空污染而不受伤害。当生物的虚空污染超过该数值时，它会患上一种持续疯狂，并且其虚空污染总量重置为0。要确定出现哪种类型的疯狂，请参考{@table Indefinite Madness|KPDM}表。",
	"Instead of bearing this scar on its psyche, a creature can choose to channel the Void's influence into a physical change, known as a flesh warp. The Void can produce an infinite variety of these effects, ranging from subtle to terrifying; the {@table Flesh Warps|KPDM} table offers a number of possibilities. A creature that has any flesh warp has disadvantage on Charisma checks involving a creature not of the Void for any purpose other than intimidation.": "在承受这种心灵创伤的代替方式，生物可以选择将虚空的影响转化为一种物理变化，称为肉体扭曲 (`Flesh Warp`)。虚空可以产生无限种类的效果，从微妙到可怕不等；{@table Flesh Warps|KPDM} 表格提供了许多可能性。拥有任何肉体扭曲的生物在与非虚空生物进行除恐吓外任何目的的魅力检定时，都会获得劣势。",
	"On either the {@table Indefinite Madness|KPDM} table or the {@table Flesh Warps|KPDM} table, a die roll dictates the outcome unless the GM decides otherwise. Under no circumstances should a player be allowed to choose a desired result.": "在{@table Indefinite Madness|KPDM}桌或{@table Flesh Warps|KPDM}桌上，除非GM另有决定，否则骰子的点数决定结果。在任何情况下，玩家都不应被允许选择所需的结果。",
	"A {@spell greater restoration} spell removes 1 point of Void taint from the target, in addition to curing the target's indefinite madness, if the creature succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.": "一个{@spell greater restoration}法术可以从目标身上移除1点虚空污染，并在目标成功通过DC 15的魅力豁免检定后，治愈目标的无限疯狂。",
	"Flesh warps are permanent manifestations of the Void within the body of a tainted creature and are incredibly difficult to remove. A {@spell regenerate} spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a creature of a flesh warp.": "肉体扭曲是虚空在被污染生物体内永久显现的表现，极其难以清除。需要使用{@spell regenerate}法术或更强大的魔法才能摆脱肉体扭曲。",
	"The work of author H. P. Lovecraft—the so-called \"Cthulhu mythos\"—has been a cornerstone of RPG storytelling since E. Gary Gygax immortalized its influence in his \"Inspirational and Educational Reading\" list. Taking its name from Lovecraft's famous story, \"The Call of Cthulhu,\" the mythos has become the backdrop for a subgenre of fiction sometimes called cosmic horror. At the foundation of cosmic horror are two ideas: that the human mind is too tiny and weak to comprehend more than the barest glimmer of the vastness of the universe and the alien mysteries it contains; and that among those mysteries are entities so ancient, powerful, and malevolent that they could extinguish Earth's insignificant civilization without caring or even noticing.": "作者H. P. Lovecraft的作品——所谓的“克苏鲁神话”——自E. Gary Gygax在他的“启发性和教育性阅读”清单中永恒地铭记其影响以来，一直是RPG叙事的基石。神话的名称取自Lovecraft的著名故事《克苏鲁的呼唤》，已经成为一种被称为宇宙恐怖的小说亚流的背景。宇宙恐怖的基础是两个观念：人类的思维太微小和脆弱，无法理解宇宙的浩瀚和其中包含的外星奥秘的一丝一毫；而在这些奥秘之中，有着古老、强大和邪恶的实体，它们可以毫不在意甚至察觉不到地扑灭地球微不足道的文明。",
	"With that in mind, this section explores those \"hidden and fathomless worlds of strange life which may pulsate in the gulfs beyond the stars\" that Lovecraft and his contemporaries pioneered in their strange fiction. Herein you will find a host of forbidden secrets and eldritch lore; a clandestine sort of magic that is full of both cosmic potential and horrific consequences, and knowledge of which erodes the sanity of all who pursue it.": "考虑到这一点，本节探讨了洛夫克拉夫特（Lovecraft）及其同时代人在他们奇异小说中开拓的那些“隐藏和深不可测的奇异生命世界，可能在星辰之外的深渊中脉动”。在这里，您将发现一系列禁忌的秘密和神秘的知识；一种秘密的魔法，充满了宇宙潜力和可怕的后果，追求这种魔法知识的人都会失去理智。",
	"The spells in this category resemble Void magic in that they harness the power of the Void, but they are not beholden to it. Mythos magic uses the Great Old Ones as a conduit for its power, while Void magic originates from the Void itself (a place of negation and emptiness that devours the cosmos, not an entity).": "这个类别中的法术类似于虚空魔法，因为它们利用虚空的力量，但并不受其束缚。神话魔法利用邪神作为其力量的导管，而虚空魔法源自虚空本身（一个吞噬宇宙的否定和空无之地，而非一个实体）。",
	"Mythos spells can be learned by anyone with magical aptitude—any character who has the ability to cast spells can add mythos spells to their spell list. All other characters can acquire a mythos spell only if they learn it from one of the forbidden and furtive tomes of the Cthulhu mythos or see the spell being cast.": "神话法术可以被任何有魔法天赋的人学会—任何有施法能力的角色都可以将神话法术添加到他们的法术列表中。其他所有角色只有在从克苏鲁神话的禁忌和隐秘典籍中学习或看到法术被施展时才能获得神话法术。",
	"But this power comes at great risk. Casters of mythos magic literally exchange their sanity for magical ability. Unless a character is protected by great Wisdom or a bulwark of arcane wards, using these spells will certainly lead to madness.": "但这种力量伴随着巨大的风险。神话魔法的施法者实际上是用精神力量换取了魔法能力。除非角色拥有极高的智慧或者一道强大的奥术结界来保护自己，否则使用这些咒语肯定会导致疯狂。",
	"Mythos magic is typically the province of {@class wizard||wizards}, although any spellcaster can learn these spells under the right circumstances.": "神话魔法通常是{@class wizard||wizards}的专属领域，尽管在适当的情况下任何施法者都可以学习这些咒语。",
	"{@note See the {@filter spells page|spells|source=KPDM|subschool=mythos} to browse and sort spells.}": "{@note See the {@filter spells page|spells|source=KPDM|subschool=mythos}浏览和排序法术。",
	"The following spells are presented in alphabetical order. When a mythos spell has a verbal component, the caster must utter it in Void Speech.": "以下咒语按字母顺序呈现。当神话咒语具有口头成分时，施法者必须用虚空语言（Void Speech）念出来。",
	"When the stars were right, they could plunge from world to world through the sky...": "当星星处于正确的位置时，它们可以穿越天空从一个世界到另一个世界...",
	"Mythos magic seethes with the unnameable secrets of the Great Old Ones—alien beings from beyond space and time whose warped, eldritch minds are immeasurably superior to our own and whose sinister, loathsome agendas challenge not only our sanity but our very existence.": "神话魔法充满了那些无法言说的伟大古老者的秘密——来自时空之外的外星生物，其扭曲、神秘的思维远远超越我们自己，其邪恶、可憎的议程不仅挑战着我们的理智，也挑战着我们的存在。",
	"Many of the spells in this section refer to and take inspiration from specific Great Old Ones and Elder Gods of the Cthulhu mythos. These names can serve as narrative waypoints as you chart the cosmic apocalypse of a mythos‑laden campaign. In the same spirit of collaboration that fueled Lovecraft's circle of writers, you should feel free to develop your own Mythic entities.": "这一部分的许多法术参考并汲取了克苏鲁神话中特定的上古之神和长者神的灵感。这些名字可以作为叙事的里程碑，帮助你描绘一个充满神话元素的宇宙末日战役。在与洛夫克拉夫特的作家圈子一样的合作精神中，你应该随意发展自己的神话实体。",
	"Some of the Great Old Ones and Elder Gods central to mythos magic include: Cthulhu, Yog‑Sothoth (the Beyond‑One), Shub‑Niggurath (the Black Goat of the Woods), Bokrug, Tsathoggua, Koth, Bran Mak Morn, Nodens, Nyarlathotep (the Crawling Chaos), Hastur, Hriggala (the Jaws of Vardesain), the Magnum Innominandum (the Not‑to‑Be‑Named One), Yig (the Father of Serpents), and the White Goddess.": "一些与神话魔法密切相关的古老伟大者和上古之神包括：克苏鲁 (Cthulhu), 犹格索托斯 (Yog‑Sothoth)（超越者）, 舒布‑尼古拉斯 (Shub‑Niggurath)（森林中的黑山羊）, 博克鲁格 (Bokrug), 萨索古亚 (Tsathoggua), 科斯 (Koth), 布兰·马克·莫恩 (Bran Mak Morn), 诺登斯 (Nodens), 尼亚拉托提普 (Nyarlathotep)（爬行混沌）, 哈斯图尔 (Hastur), 赫里加拉 (Hriggala)（瓦德赛因之颚）, 无名大权 (Magnum Innominandum)（不可名状者）, 伊格 (Yig)（蛇之父）, 以及白色女神。",
	"If antiquity looks upon the stories of Tolkien and dreams of fated rings, or reflects upon the multiverse of Moorcock's White Wolf and thinks of cursed swords, then surely the Cthulhu mythos will be remembered for its magical tomes. Described here are three of the most infamous installments in the mythos atheneum: the accursed {@i Necronomicon}, Robert E. Howard's {@i Nameless Cults}, and the ubiquitous {@i Book of Eibon}. Mythos spells can be learned only from a mythos grimoire like these or through direct contact with a mythos spellcaster—and those grimoires and casters take many abhorrent forms.": "如果古代审视托尔金的故事，梦想着命运之戒，或者反思穆尔科克的白狼多元宇宙，想到被诅咒的剑，那么克苏鲁神话必将因其神秘的魔法典籍而被铭记。这里描述了神话图书馆中三个最臭名昭著的部分：被诅咒的{@i Necronomicon}，罗伯特·E·霍华德的{@i Nameless Cults}，以及无处不在的{@i Book of Eibon}。只有从这样的神话典籍或直接接触神话咒术师才能学习神话咒语——而那些典籍和咒术师有着多种可憎的形态。",
	"With a multiverse-wide perspective in mind, these books are considered to be translations of the \"real world\" originals—which is to say, they come from the alternate-history Earth of Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos setting, including elements of Howard's Hyborian Age. How they made their way through time and space to wind up on alien worlds or your own setting is the stuff of splendidly macabre speculation (and ultimately is up to you, the GM). One thing's for sure: these tomes are beyond precious to all who hunger for the eldritch knowledge of the Great Old Ones, and such longings aren't restricted to humanity and near-humanity. There also exist multitudes of odious aberrations, monstrosities, fiends, and worse entities who will stop at nothing to possess these tomes.": "考虑到整个多元宇宙的视角，这些书籍被认为是“现实世界”原作的翻译——也就是说，它们来自洛夫克拉夫特克苏鲁神话设定的另类历史地球，包括霍华德的海伯利安时代的元素。它们是如何穿越时间和空间来到外星世界或你自己的设定中的，这是一个充满了精彩阴森推测的故事（最终由你，GM，决定）。有一点可以肯定：这些卷轴对所有渴望了解上古邪神知识的人都是无比珍贵的，这种渴望不仅限于人类和类人种。还存在着许多可憎的畸变、怪物、恶魔和更糟糕的实体，它们将不惜一切代价来获取这些卷轴。",
	"Every world has an abundance of villainous types that stand in the way of what the heroes want to accomplish. Two more examples of that sort are presented below: the {@class cleric} who seduces followers instead of saving them, and the grisly {@class wizard} known as the {@class wizard||necrophage|necrophage|KPDM}.": "每个世界都有大量邪恶的角色，他们阻碍英雄们想要实现的目标。以下是另外两个这种类型的例子：{@class cleric}，他诱惑追随者而不是拯救他们；以及那个可怕的{@class wizard}，被称为{@class wizard||necrophage|necrophage|KPDM}。",
	"Wizards and other practitioners of magic create traps that use spells as much as they use physical objects; some of these hindrances have features in common with pits and spear traps, while others rely on a series of finely wrought glyphs or enchanted components that require arcane knowledge to identify, much less disarm. A small collection of these traps is provided here.": "巫师和其他魔法实践者创造的陷阱不仅使用物理物体，还使用法术；一些这样的障碍与坑洞和矛陷阱有共同之处，而其他的则依赖于一系列精巧制作的符文或附魔组件，需要奥术知识才能识别，更不用说解除了。这里提供了一小部分这样的陷阱。",
	"This section contains riffs and twists for three classic spells: {@spell charm person}, {@spell fireball}, and {@spell raise dead}. These experimental variations are meant to entertain players and GMs who are more experienced with—or even jaded by—the standard versions. Changes affect both flavor and implementation, so the spells look different when cast, have different power levels, and even have radically different effects.": "这一部分包含了三个经典法术{@spell charm person}、{@spell fireball}和{@spell raise dead}的变体和变化。这些实验性的变化旨在娱乐那些对标准版本更有经验甚至已经审美疲劳的玩家和GM。这些变化影响了法术的风格和实施方式，因此当施放时，这些法术看起来不同，具有不同的能量水平，甚至有着截然不同的效果。",

Some are similar in effect to the original but with altered story elements, and others have more pronounced tweaks to their effects on the game.": "每个部分涵盖了三个标准法术中的一个，其中包含了对其主题的变化。有些效果类似于原始版本，但故事元素有所改变，而其他一些则对游戏效果进行了更明显的调整。",

Though some might consider the idea of a fixed destiny fatalistic, the bards of this college are inspired by this viewpoint. One may not choose the manner of one's death, but one can choose how to meet it, and that idea is at the heart of this college. An insect might be caught in a spider's web. Whether it lives or dies, its struggles ultimately shake the web in its entirety, and it might free itself through such effort. The struggle affects all things, however remotely connected they might be, whereas the insect that merely accepts its death leaves not even a ripple behind. To confront fate, to embrace the wyrd and whatever it brings, is to have the power to shake the world and make it take notice.": "卫德歌者学院（College of Wyrdsingers）的吟游诗人信奉“命运”（wyrd），这是一个以同名现象为中心的哲学。命运是那将会发生的事，与命运和宿命等概念紧密相连。虽然有些人可能认为固定命运的想法是宿命论的，但这个学院的吟游诗人却受到这种观点的启发。一个人可能无法选择自己的死法，但可以选择如何面对它，这个想法正是这个学院的核心。一只昆虫可能被困在蜘蛛网中。无论它生还是死，它的挣扎最终会震动整个蜘蛛网，通过这种努力它可能会自救。这种挣扎会影响所有事物，无论它们之间的联系有多遥远，而仅仅接受死亡的昆虫甚至不会留下一丝涟漪。直面命运，拥抱命运和它所带来的一切，就是拥有震动世界并引起注意的力量。",

When the spell ends, the creature knows it was {@condition charmed} by you.": "你尝试魅惑一个你能看到的人形生物。它进行一次感知豁免，如果你或你的同伴正在与它战斗或威胁它，则具有优势。如果豁免失败，人形生物会保持{@condition charmed}，直到法术持续时间结束，直到你或你的任何同伴对其造成伤害，或者直到满月升起。这个{@condition charmed}生物会把你视为友好的熟人。当法术结束时，生物会知道它被你{@condition charmed}。",
	"You return a dead creature you touch to a ghostly and incorporeal form, provided it has been dead no longer than 10 days. The creature can see and hear, and it can speak in a hollow, sepulchral tone if it chooses to. Whether it's willing to speak to you depends on its whim and its prior relationship with you, if any.": "你可以将你触摸的死亡生物转变为幽灵般的无实体形态，前提是它死亡时间不超过10天。这个生物可以看见和听见，如果选择的话，它可以用空洞、坟墓般的语调说话。它是否愿意和你交谈取决于它的心情和它与你之前的关系，如果有的话。",
	"The affected creature is not undead; it is alive but incorporeal, with 1 hit point. It can't interact with the physical world, attack or cause damage, or cast spells. It is immune to nonmagical damage. It can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but it takes {@damage 1d10} force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. It regains hit points normally through resting or spending hit dice but never recovers hit points via magic spells, items, or potions.": "受影响的生物不是不死生物；它是有生命的，但是无实体，只有1点生命值。它无法与物质世界互动、攻击或造成伤害，也无法施放法术。它对非魔法伤害免疫。它可以穿过生物和物体，就像它们是艰难地形一样，但如果它在物体内结束自己的回合，它会受到{@damage 1d10}的力量伤害。它可以通过休息或消耗生命骰来恢复生命值，但永远不会通过魔法法术、物品或药水恢复生命值。",
	"This spell also neutralizes any poison and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life.": "这个法术还会中和生物死亡时受到的任何毒素，并治愈非魔法疾病。这个法术不会清除魔法疾病、诅咒或类似效果；如果在施法前没有清除这些效果，那么当生物复活时它们会生效。",
	"The spell also closes mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.": "这个法术也可以治愈致命伤，但不能恢复缺失的身体部位。如果生物缺少对其生存至关重要的身体部位或器官，比如头部，那么这个法术会自动失败。",
	"Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target has a −4 penalty to saving throws and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.": "死而复生是一场磨难。目标在豁免 throws 和能力检定时受到 -4 的惩罚。每当目标完成一次长休时，惩罚值减少 1，直到消失。",
	"A creature affected by {@i raise ghost} is restored to normal, physical life by {@spell raise dead} or comparable magic. {@i Raise ghost} has no effect if cast on an undead creature.": "受到{@i raise ghost}影响的生物可以通过{@spell raise dead}或类似的魔法恢复正常的生理状态。如果对不死生物施放{@i Raise ghost}，则没有任何效果。",
	"This spell is identical to {@spell raise dead} in every way except duration; the creature is restored to life for only 24 hours. The spell can be recast on the same creature, but on the second and subsequent castings, the caster must roll a {@dice d20}. If the roll equals or is less than the number of prior castings on the same creature, the spell fails and cannot affect that creature again. Each new casting resets the clock to 24 hours; it doesn't stack another 24 hours onto a previous casting.": "这个法术在每个方面都与{@spell raise dead}相同，唯一不同的是持续时间；生物只能在24小时内复活。这个法术可以在同一生物身上再次施放，但在第二次及以后的施放中，施法者必须投掷一个{@dice d20}。如果投掷的结果等于或小于之前在同一生物身上施放的次数，法术会失败，无法再次影响该生物。每次新的施法都会将时间重置为24小时；它不会在之前的施法上再叠加另外的24小时。",
	"This spell is identical to {@spell raise ghost|KPDM} in every way, except the ghostly figure can manipulate, hold, or carry objects weighing up to 5 pounds. Note that while 5 pounds of force is enough to pick up many melee weapons, it's not sufficient to wield one in combat, or to draw a bow.": "这个法术在每个方面都与{@spell raise ghost|KPDM}相同，唯一的区别是幽灵般的形象可以操纵、拿着或携带重量达5磅的物体。请注意，虽然5磅的力量足以拿起许多近战武器，但不足以在战斗中使用，或者拉弓。",
	"This spell is identical to {@spell raise dead}, except it simultaneously raises two creatures with opposite alignments. For example, if you raise a Lawful Good paladin, then somewhere nearby, a Chaotic Evil warrior of similar power also returns to life. The second corpse must be within 100 miles. The two raised creatures have a vague sense of the direction and distance to their nemesis. They aren't compelled to battle one another or even to seek each other out. Their lives are, however, inextricably bound together in such a way that if either of them dies, the other also drops dead instantly.": "这个法术与{@spell raise dead}完全相同，但同时复活两个具有相反取向的生物。例如，如果你复活了一个守序善良的圣骑士，那么附近某处也会复活一个混乱邪恶的同等实力的战士。第二具尸体必须在100英里内。这两个被复活的生物会模糊感知到彼此的方向和距离。他们并不被迫互相战斗，甚至不一定要寻找对方。然而，他们的生命是紧密相连的，如果其中一个死亡，另一个也会立刻死去。",
	"Evil NPCs brought back with raise nemesis typically see it as an opportunity to create every sort of trouble imaginable. If the spell is cast on a creature of true Neutral alignment, only that creature is restored to life.": "通常，用复活劲敌(`raise nemesis`)复活的邪恶NPC会将其视为创造各种难以想象的麻烦的机会。如果这个法术施加在一个真正中立(`true Neutral`)阵营的生物身上，那么只有那个生物会被复活。",
	"This spell is identical to {@spell raise dead}, but it works only on a creature that died of old age. The spell grants the raised elder one additional year of life. The raised creature has entirely white hair, its eyes are weak, and it loses 2 points each from Strength and Constitution; no magic less potent than a {@spell wish} can restore these lost points. In all other respects, the creature can live out its life normally until the added year elapses.": "这个法术与{@spell raise dead}完全相同，但只能对死于老年的生物施展。该法术让复活的老者额外多活一年。复活的生物头发全白，眼睛变得虚弱，力量和体质各减少2点；除非使用{@spell wish}这样强大的魔法，否则无法恢复这些丢失的属性点。在其他方面，生物可以正常地度过其余生命，直到额外的一年结束。",
	"{@i Raise elder} has no effect if it's cast on the same creature a second time.": "如果{@i Raise elder}在同一生物身上施放第二次，则无效。",
	"This spell is identical to {@spell raise dead}, except it empowers you to impose a {@spell geas} on the creature you raise. The targeted soul can opt to decline the geas, in which case it isn't restored to life. If the creature accepts your geas, it must complete the task within 30 days. If it accepts but fails to meet the conditions of the geas, it dies on the dawn of the 31st day and its spirit again departs the mortal world. If it accomplishes the task, it's free to live out the remainder of its restored life as it chooses.": "这个法术与{@spell raise dead}完全相同，只是它赋予你能力对你复活的生物施加{@spell geas}。被选中的灵魂可以选择拒绝这个神秘力量，如果这样做，它将不会被复活。如果生物接受了你的神秘力量，它必须在30天内完成任务。如果它接受了但未能满足神秘力量的条件，它将在第31天的黎明时死去，它的灵魂再次离开这个世界。如果它完成了任务，它可以自由选择如何度过其恢复的余生。",
	"A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range, where it blossoms with a low roar to engulf a single creature in searing flame.

	"A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range, where it slowly ignites the air itself with phlogiston. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere around the target point takes {@damage 4d6} fire damage, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Every target that takes damage takes the same amount of damage again at the start of your next two turns unless it uses an action to put out the flames on its clothing, hair, and other accoutrements. Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried are also ignited.": "一道明亮的光线从你伸出的手指闪过，照射到你选择的范围内的一个点，那里慢慢点燃了空气中的火气。目标点周围20英尺半径范围内的每个生物会受到{@damage 4d6}火焰伤害，或者在成功的敏捷豁免才能下受到一半伤害。每个受到伤害的目标在你接下来的两个回合开始时都会再次受到同样数量的伤害，除非它使用一个动作来扑灭身上的火焰、头发和其他装饰物。区域内未被穿戴或携带的易燃物品也会被点燃。",

	"A bolt of flame streaks from your finger toward a point you choose within range, then explodes into an inferno of flame. Each creature within 20 feet of the explosion takes {@damage 7d6} fire damage, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw.": "一道火焰之箭从你的手指射向你选择的范围内的一个点，然后爆炸成一团火焰之焰。爆炸范围内的每个生物受到{@damage 7d6}火焰伤害，或者在成功的敏捷豁免才能中受到一半伤害。",
	"Immediately afterward, a second bolt of flame streaks from that explosion to a second target point you can see exactly 40 feet from the first explosion. It explodes again at the second target point, causing another {@damage 7d6} fire damage (halved by a successful Dexterity saving throw). Then the flame jumps instantly again to a third target point, also within your line of sight and exactly 40 feet from the second explosion, where it detonates for the final time with identical results.": "紧接着，第二道火焰闪电从爆炸点射向第二个目标点，距离第一个爆炸点正好40英尺。它再次在第二个目标点爆炸，造成另外{@damage 7d6}点火焰伤害（成功的敏捷豁免可减半）。然后火焰立即跳至第三个目标点，同样在你的视线范围内，距离第二次爆炸点正好40英尺，最终再次引爆，效果相同。",
	"Note that for the second and third bursts, the flame jumps exactly 40 feet—never more, never less—and if any part of a burst area overlaps the area of a previous burst, the burst fails to happen and the spell ends immediately.": "请注意，对于第二和第三次爆发，火焰跳跃的距离恰好为40英尺—不多不少—如果任何一个爆发区域与之前爆发区域重叠，那么爆发将失败并立即结束法术。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 7d6|6-9|1d6} for each slot level above 6th.": "当你使用7级或更高级别的法术位施放此法术时，伤害将每超过6级的位级增加{@scaledamage 7d6|6-9|1d6}。",
	"You temporarily make a creature within range less appealing to others. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw against your spell. On a successful save, the spell is ineffective. On a failed save, the next time the creature makes a Charisma check before the spell ends, roll a {@dice d6} and subtract the result from the roll. The spell then ends.": "你暂时让范围内的生物变得不那么吸引人。目标需要对你的法术进行一次感知豁免。在成功豁免时，法术无效。在失败豁免时，生物在法术结束前下次进行魅力检定时，投掷一个{@dice d6}的骰子，并从检定结果中减去这个数值。然后法术结束。",
	"You imbue a terrifying visage onto a gourd and toss it ahead of you to a spot of your choosing within range. Each creature within 15 feet of that spot takes {@damage 6d8} psychic damage and becomes {@condition frightened} of you for 1 minute; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the fright. A creature {@condition frightened} in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.": "你将一个可怕的面孔灌注到一个葫芦上，然后将其投掷到你选择范围内的一个地点。距离那个地点15英尺内的每个生物会受到{@damage 6d8}点精神伤害，并在1分钟内变成你的{@condition frightened}；成功的感知豁免可以减半伤害并消除恐惧效果。被这种方式影响的生物会在每个自己的回合结束时重复进行豁免才能，成功则结束对自己的影响。",

	"You cloak yourself in a protective field that absorbs incoming magic, rejuvenating your spell slots. When you are the target of a spell (including spells that affect multiple targets, but not area spells such as fireball), make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell has no effect on you and is absorbed by the field. You regain a spell slot of the same level as the spell that was cast against you.

	"You adjust the location of an ally to a better tactical position. You move one willing creature within range 5 feet. This movement does not provoke {@action opportunity attack||opportunity attacks}. The creature moves bodily through the intervening space (as opposed to teleporting), so there can be no physical obstacle (such as a wall or a door) in the path.": "你调整一个盟友的位置，使其处于更有利的战术位置。你可以移动一个愿意的生物，距离范围为5英尺。这次移动不会引发{@action opportunity attack||opportunity attacks}。生物在移动时会身体穿越中间空间（而不是瞬间移动），因此路径中不能有物理障碍（如墙壁或门）。",

	"You clap your hands, setting off a chain of tiny events that culminate in throwing off an enemy's aim. When an enemy makes a ranged attack with a weapon or a spell that hits one of your allies, this spell causes the enemy to reroll the attack roll unless the enemy makes a successful Charisma saving throw. The attack is resolved using the lower of the two rolls (effectively giving the enemy disadvantage on the attack).": "你拍了拍手，引发了一系列微小事件，最终导致敌人瞄准失误。当敌人使用武器或法术进行远程攻击击中你的盟友时，这个法术会让敌人重新投掷攻击骰，除非敌人成功进行一个魅力豁免。攻击结果使用两次投掷中较低的那个（实际上让敌人在攻击时处于劣势）。",

Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit.

	"When you cast this spell using a 3rd-level spell slot, it can be used on the corpse of a Large humanoid to create a Large {@creature ghoul}. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, this spell creates a {@creature ghast}, but the material component changes to an onyx gemstone worth at least 200 gp.": "当你使用3级法术位施放这个法术时，它可以用在一个大型人形生物的尸体上，创造一个大型{@creature ghoul}。当你使用4级或更高级别的法术位施放这个法术时，这个法术创造一个{@creature ghast}，但材料成分变为价值至少200gp的缟玛瑙宝石。",
	"This spell creates an undead servant from a pile of bones or from the corpse of a Large or Huge humanoid within range.

	"The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying your commands. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again while you have it controlled.

	"The paper or parchment must be folded into the shape of an animal before casting the spell. It then becomes an animated paper animal of the kind the folded paper most closely resembles. The creature uses the stat block of any {@filter beast that has a challenge rating of 0|bestiary|type=beast|challenge rating=[&0;&0]}. It is made of paper, not flesh and bone, but it can do anything the real creature can do: a paper {@creature owl} can fly and attack with its talons, a paper {@creature frog} can swim without disintegrating in water, and so forth. It follows your commands to the best of its ability, including carrying messages to a recipient whose location you know.": "在施放咒语之前，纸张或羊皮必须折叠成动物的形状。然后它会变成最接近折叠纸张的动物形象的一只动态纸张动物。这个生物使用任何{@filter beast that has a challenge rating of 0|bestiary|type=beast|challenge rating=[&0;&0]}的属性块。它由纸张制成，而不是血肉和骨头，但它可以做任何真实生物可以做的事情：一只纸{@creature owl}可以飞行并用它的爪子攻击，一只纸{@creature frog}可以在水中游泳而不会分解，等等。它会尽力按照你的命令行动，包括传递消息给你知道位置的收件人。",

	"This spell creates a link between you and a nearby source of arcane power, allowing you to draw on its strength to bolster your spellcasting ability. When you cast a spell, you can use a bonus action to draw on the link. Doing so means you expend no spell slots to cast the spell, the energy instead comes from the external power.": "这个法术在你和附近的一处奥术能量源之间建立了一条联系，让你能够借助它的力量来增强你的施法能力。当你施放一个法术时，你可以使用一个奖励动作来利用这个联系。这样做意味着你不需要消耗法术槽来施放法术，能量来自外部力量。",
	"The more you draw on the link, the harder it is to maintain. Each spell you cast in this manner decreases the duration of this spell's casting by 10 minutes per level of the spell you cast using the link.

The target must have a physical body; the spell fails if the target is normally noncorporeal.": "当施放在一具死亡或不死之身上时，此法术会使那个生物恢复到生前健康无伤时的外貌。目标必须有一个实体身体；如果目标通常是无实体的，则法术失败。",

The target looks, smells, and sounds (if it can speak) as it did in life.": "如果目标是一只不死生物，它也会恢复到它生前的样子，即使它是因疾病、严重伤势或数个世纪前死亡。目标的外表、气味和声音（如果它能说话）都会恢复到生前的状态。",
	"Friends and family can tell something is wrong only with a successful Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check against your spell save DC, and only if they have reason to be suspicious.

	"This spell doesn't confer the ability to speak on undead that normally can't speak. The creature eats, drinks, and breathes as a living creature does; it can mimic sleep, but it has no more need for it than it had before.": "这个法术并不能让那些通常不能说话的不死生物获得说话的能力。这种生物会像活着的生物一样进食、饮水和呼吸；它可以模仿睡眠，但它对睡眠的需求并不比以前更多。",
	"The effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your caster level. You can use an action to end the spell early. Any amount of radiant or necrotic damage dealt to the creature, or any effect that reduces its Constitution, also ends the spell.": "效果持续时间为你的施法者等级的小时数。你可以使用一个动作来提前结束法术。对生物造成的任何量的辐射或死灵伤害，或任何降低其体质的效果，也会结束这个法术。",
	"If this spell is cast on an undead creature that isn't your ally or under your control, it makes a Charisma saving throw to resist the effect.": "如果这个法术施放在一个不是你盟友或在你控制之下的不死生物身上，它需要进行一次魅力豁免检定来抵抗该效果。",
	"You touch the ashes, embers, or soot left behind by a fire and receive a vision of one significant event that occurred in the area while the fire was burning. For example, if you were to touch the cold embers of a campfire, you might witness a snippet of a conversation that occurred around the fire. Similarly, touching the ashes of a burned letter might grant you a vision of the person who destroyed the letter or the contents of the letter. You have no control over what information the spell reveals, but your vision usually is tied to the most meaningful event related to the fire. The GM determines the details of what is revealed.": "当你触摸火灾留下的灰烬、余烬或煤灰时，你会得到一个与火灾发生时区域内的一个重要事件有关的幻象。例如，如果你触摸一个篝火的冷余烬，你可能会看到篝火周围发生的一段对话。同样地，触摸一封烧焦的信件的灰烬可能会让你看到摧毁这封信件的人或信件的内容。你无法控制这个法术揭示的信息，但你的幻象通常与与火灾相关的最有意义的事件有关。GM决定揭示的细节。",
	"You alter the appearance of a creature you touch, giving it a more simian form. While this spell is in effect, the subject gains a climbing speed equal to its normal walking speed, and gains advantage on Strength ({@skill Athletics}) checks made when jumping or climbing. When up in a tree's branches (or in a similar area, at the GM's discretion) the target can move up to its climbing speed as a bonus action, using brachiation to reach a nearby tree if the branches are close enough together. This bonus action can be taken only if the subject has at least two hands free, or one hand free if the subject is barefoot.": "你改变了你触摸的生物的外观，使其更像猿类。在这个法术生效期间，目标获得一个等于其正常行走速度的攀爬速度，并且在进行跳跃或攀爬时获得优势，这些检定是关于力量({@skill Athletics})的。当在树枝上（或类似区域，由GM决定）时，目标可以作为一个奖励动作移动到其攀爬速度，使用摆臂来到达附近的树，如果树枝足够接近的话。只有在目标至少有两只手空闲时，或者如果目标赤脚时有一只手空闲时，才能进行这个奖励动作。",

	"As an action, you can emit a blast of light 5 feet wide and 50 feet long. All creatures in its path take {@damage 6d6} fire damage and are {@condition blinded} for {@dice 1d4} rounds. A successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the blindness. Each time you use this feature of the spell, its duration is reduced by 1 hour. When you expend the last hour of the duration, the spell ends at the start of your next turn.": "作为一个动作，你可以发射一道宽5英尺、长50英尺的光束。路径上的所有生物会受到{@damage 6d6}火焰伤害，并在接下来的{@dice 1d4} 回合内变为{@condition blinded}。成功的敏捷豁免才能减半伤害并消除致盲效果。每次你使用这个法术特性，它的持续时间会减少1小时。当你消耗完最后一个小时的持续时间时，法术会在你的下一个回合开始时结束。",
	"You take on the aspect of a ram, including some physical attributes. Your body hair grows thick and woolly, and a curling pair of horns sprouts from your head.
