	"Too many arcane spellcasters and scholars view alchemy as magic's poor second cousin—an academic pursuit with practical applications, but still nothing that wizards with real talent would devote serious time or effort to. While alchemy can achieve astounding, even nearly miraculous feats, it's always been overshadowed by the power and versatility of arcane magic. Because alchemy requires extensive preparation and forethought, adventurers tend to prefer the flexibility and immediacy of spellcasting.": "许多奥术施法者和学者认为炼金术只是魔法的次等亲戚——一种具有实际应用的学术追求，但仍然不是真正有才华的巫师会花费大量时间和精力去专研的。虽然炼金术可以实现令人惊讶甚至近乎奇迹般的壮举，但它一直被奥术魔法的力量和多样性所掩盖。由于炼金术需要大量的准备和思考，冒险者们往往更喜欢施法的灵活性和即时性。",
	"In some areas, a branch of alchemy is practiced that surpasses the simple alchemy familiar to the rest of the world. Known as magical chemistry, or simply alkemancy, this discipline delves into the properties of common alchemical substances, such as brimstone and salt, and the means by which they can be used to achieve physical and metaphysical transformation in objects and creatures on levels unseen in most lands. Alkemancy practitioners combine their understanding of alchemical reagents and elixirs with their knowledge of spellcraft to create new and formidable magical effects.": "在一些地区，存在一种超越世界其他地方熟知的简单炼金术的炼金分支。被称为魔法化学，或简称为炼金术，这门学科探讨常见炼金物质（如硫磺和盐）的属性，以及它们如何被用来在物体和生物上实现物理和形而上的转化，这在大多数土地上是看不到的。炼金术师将他们对炼金试剂和药剂的理解与他们对咒术的知识相结合，创造出新的、强大的魔法效果。",
	"Even more than this, though, alkemancy embodies a unique philosophy of life and nature. Alkemancers don't concoct useful potions and philters as an end in itself. Ultimately, they seek to expand their minds past mortal limits, or even to achieve true immortality, and alkemancy is simply the path they follow in pursuit of that goal.": "甚至比这更重要的是，炼金术体现了一种独特的生活和自然哲学。炼金术师并非仅仅为了调制有用的药剂和过滤剂而存在。最终，他们追求超越凡人极限的思想，甚至实现真正的永生，而炼金术只是他们在追求这一目标过程中所遵循的路径。",
	"Transmuters and alkemancers belong to similar schools of thought. But where transmuters have little use for alchemy and its secrets, preferring to rely on brute magical force to achieve their aims—at least, that's the opinion held by traditional alchemists—alkemancers combine extensive knowledge of alchemy with the many ways that the six fundamental essences can be applied to arcane magic.": "变形术师和炼金术士属于类似的思想流派。但是，变形术师对炼金术及其秘密几乎没有用处，更倾向于依靠强大的魔法力量来实现他们的目标——至少，这是传统炼金术士所持有的观点——而炼金术士结合了对炼金术的广泛知识以及六种基本精华如何应用于奥术魔法的多种方式。",
	"The power of alkemancy resides within the six fundamental essences: brimstone, lead, quicksilver, quintessence, salt, and void salt. These essences parallel the four standard elements, as well as the two more esoteric elements of metal and void, but are unique to alchemy.": "炼金术的力量存在于六种基本本质之中：硫磺、铅、水银、第五元素、盐和虚空盐。这些本质与四大标准元素以及金属和虚空这两种更神秘的元素相对应，但是它们是独特于炼金术的。",
	"The yellow of brimstone (otherwise known as sulfur) represents activity, energy, and masculinity, and it's related to the sun, volcanoes, and elemental fire. Brimstone is a destructive essence present in small amounts in explosives, various acids, and in substances such as {@item alchemist's fire (flask)|phb|alchemist's fire}.": "硫磺（又称为硫）的黄色代表着活力、能量和男性气质，与太阳、火山和元素火相关。硫磺是一种破坏性的精华，在爆炸物、各种酸和诸如{@item alchemist's fire (flask)|phb|alchemist's fire}等物质中以少量存在。",
	"Also erroneously referred to as antimony (a different metal that lead is sometimes combined with), lead represents coldness and heaviness, transformation, and the removal of impurities in objects and creatures. It is associated with broader elemental metals and is often called the oldest or first metal. Lead is reactive and can be toxic in various forms over long periods of exposure—useful qualities in lingering poisons and slow-acting corrosives. It's used as a component in many alchemical creations and supplies.": "有时被错误地称为锑(与铅有时混合在一起的另一种金属)，铅代表着冷静和沉重，变革，以及去除物体和生物中的杂质。它与更广泛的元素金属相关，并经常被称为最古老或第一种金属。铅具有反应性，在长时间暴露下以各种形式可能具有毒性——这些特质在残留毒药和缓慢腐蚀剂中非常有用。它被用作许多炼金创作和补给品中的组成部分。",
	"Also known as mercury, this silvery metal represents passivity, femininity, and malleability. It's associated with elemental water and the moon. Quicksilver is seen as a creative essence despite its passive nature. It's also a lethal poison, much faster-acting than lead, for example. A fluid dram of refined quicksilver is occasionally used in vials of both alchemical poisons and antitoxins.": "也被称为水银，这种银白色金属代表着被动性、女性特质和可塑性。它与水元素和月亮有关。尽管水银被视为一种被动的本质，但也被看作是一种创造性的要素。它也是一种致命的毒药，比如比铅更快速地发挥作用。精制水银的流量很少被用于炼金毒药和解毒剂的小瓶中。",
	"One of the rarest and most mysterious of the six fundamental essences, quintessence represents thought, life, and spirit. It is distantly related to elemental air; in its commonest form, it appears as a vaporous, silvery liquid. Quintessence is never used in common alchemical items, largely because it's one of the most difficult of the essences to obtain and it dissipates as soon as it's exposed to air. Alkemancers are always keen to find viable substitutes for quintessence in their concoctions.": "六大基本本质之一，精华代表着思想、生命和精神，是最稀有和神秘的之一。它与元素空气有着遥远的联系；在最常见的形式下，它呈现为一种蒸气状的银色液体。精华从不用于常见的炼金物品中，主要是因为它是最难获取的本质之一，一旦暴露在空气中就会消散。炼金术士们总是渴望在他们的配方中找到可替代精华的替代品。",
	"The most common of the six fundamental essences is salt, which represents matter, physicality, and the human body. It is closely related to elemental earth. Purified salt is used in many common alchemical items, and solutions of salt are used widely in mundane and supernatural formulas and rituals.": "六种基本精华中最常见的是盐，代表物质、物质性和人体。它与元素土密切相关。纯化的盐被用于许多常见的炼金物品，盐溶液被广泛用于日常和超自然配方和仪式中。",
	"Dull black crystals distilled from the blood of slain creatures of the Void, the substance known as Void salt takes its name from its granular appearance. Void salt is associated with dissolution, entropy, and madness. It is a dangerous substance to work with, because merely touching it with bare skin deals 1 necrotic damage. Anyone intending to work with Void salt should wear gloves of metal or thick leather, and even those substances corrode soon after coming in contact with Void salt unless they're protected with an anti-necrotic energy coating. The use of Void salt is reserved for rare alchemical concoctions, mainly acids, poisons, and explosives.": "从虚空生物的鲜血中提炼出来的暗黑晶体，被称为虚空盐的物质因其颗粒状外观而得名。虚空盐与溶解、熵和疯狂有关。这是一种危险的物质，因为光是用裸露的皮肤接触就会造成1点死灵伤害。任何打算使用虚空盐的人都应该戴着金属或厚皮手套，即使是这些物质在接触虚空盐后不久也会腐蚀，除非它们被防死灵能量涂层保护。虚空盐的使用仅限于稀有的炼金混合物，主要是酸、毒药和爆炸物。",
	"Most alkemancy spells reside on the {@class wizard} spell list. The {@class sorcerer} and the {@class warlock} also have access to a smattering of alkemancy magic.": "大多数炼金术法术位于{@class wizard}法术清单上。{@class sorcerer}和{@class warlock}也能够使用少量的炼金术魔法。",

	"The heavenly planes shine with light and power, as deities both benevolent and stern look down from their thrones. Without question, the most powerful of those gods' servants are the angels. Angels carry the word of their creators to mortal ears and bring down their righteous blades against creatures of darkness. These entities are mighty beyond mortal ken, and their very names seethe with the essence of creation. The secrets of harnessing the power of the angels are hidden within those names, and a select few mortals have learned how to realize that potential.": "天堂位面闪耀着光芒和力量，善良和严厉的神祇俯视着他们的王座。毫无疑问，这些神祇中最强大的仆人就是天使。天使将他们创造者的话语传达给凡人，并用他们正义的利刃对抗黑暗生物。这些存在远超凡人所能理解，他们的名字本身就充满了创世本质。掌握天使力量的秘密隐藏在这些名字之中，只有少数凡人学会了如何发挥这种潜力。",
	"The first angelic seals and wards were passed to worthy mortals as rewards for their sacrifice and valor in the service of light, and as weapons to be used in the struggle against the fiendish hordes. An angelic seal is the written form of the true name of an angel, inscribed on an object or a surface in a particular way to draw on the essence of that angel's power. That power flows through the written representation and into the individual who carries it, or into a location that bears a ward. The angel isn't harmed or hindered when a fraction of its power is siphoned this way, but it does notice, and woe befalls any wicked soul who steals the secret of a seal and misuses its power.": "最初的天使印章和结界被赋予值得的凡人，作为他们为光明服务中的牺牲和勇气的奖励，也作为对抗邪恶军团的斗争中使用的武器。天使印章是天使真名的书写形式，以特定方式刻在物体或表面上，以汲取天使力量的本质。这种力量通过书面表现流向携带它的个体，或者流向带有结界的地点。当以这种方式吸取其力量的一部分时，天使不会受到伤害或阻碍，但它会注意到，任何邪恶灵魂窃取印章的秘密并滥用其力量的人都会遭受不幸。",
	"Seals and wards aren't the only expressions of angelic power available to mortals.

Taking unformed matter and shaping it to conform to one's will is an effective way of blending the physical and arcane arts. The dwarves' greatest magic has come from this effort, as evidenced by the legendary weapons, armor, and implements of war that emerge from their mountain strongholds. Few dwarves pursue the study of magic aside from devotion to their deities, but one discipline bridges the gap between creation and spellcasting: ring magic.": "矮人以塑造物质世界而闻名。土地、石头和金属都顺从于矮人锤子的意志。很容易假设矮人在塑造材料方面有如此高超的技能，他们就没有时间和精力成为奥术大师，但这种假设是错误的。将未成形的物质塑造成符合自己意志的方式是融合物质和奥术艺术的有效方法。矮人最伟大的魔法正是来自这种努力，正如从他们的山寨中涌现出的传奇武器、盔甲和战争工具所证明的那样。除了对他们的神明的奉献之外，很少有矮人追求魔法的研究，但有一门学科弥合了创造和施法之间的鸿沟：戒指魔法。",

	"Every archmage needs someone to clean dishes, tend to meals, and wash bedpans. Although some wizards use spells or servants to perform these duties, others give these jobs to their apprentices, budding wizards they have taken under their wings to learn the esteemed art of magic.

	"Lereilel was born into an affluent family and displayed an affinity for magic when she came of age—much to the chagrin of her socialite mother, who constantly expressed her disappointment that Lereilel had taken after her father's looks and whims. Although she was discouraged by her mother's disapproval and the mirthful stares of the men her mother brought to woo her, Lereilel eventually convinced her father to let her study magic under the tutelage of Ravin Wyrdstone. Since then, Lereilel has worked hard to prove herself but still thinks that her appearance holds her back. She has faith that the transmutation magic she is studying might hold the key to \"correcting\" her unsightly looks and finally make her mother proud of her.": "莱蕾尔(Lereilel)出生在一个富裕家庭，当她成年时展现出对魔法的亲和力——这让她那位社交名媛母亲感到非常不悦，母亲经常表达对莱蕾尔像父亲一样外貌和怪念头的失望。尽管她受到母亲的反对和母亲带来追求她的男士们的嬉笑注视，莱蕾尔最终说服父亲让她在雷文·怀德斯通(Ravin Wyrdstone)的指导下学习魔法。从那时起，莱蕾尔努力工作以证明自己，但仍然认为自己的外表阻碍了她。她相信她正在学习的变形魔法可能是“纠正”她不雅外貌并最终让母亲为她感到骄傲的关键。",
	"Recently, Lereilel has been seeing Thaliydor Brightcrest, a handsome half-elf and a local carpenter who seems to think the world of her despite her homeliness. Unfortunately for her, Lereilel does not realize she is being duped and that Thaliydor is actually an assassin (CE male half-elf 5th-level rogue) who is using her to get closer to her master.": "最近，莱瑞蕾尔（Lereilel）开始和萨利多·布莱特克雷斯特（Thaliydor Brightcrest）约会，他是一位英俊的半精灵，也是当地的木匠，尽管她相貌平平，但他似乎对她非常看重。不幸的是，莱瑞蕾尔并没有意识到自己被欺骗，萨利多实际上是一名刺客（中立邪恶男性半精灵5级游荡者），他利用她接近她的主人。",
	"Loreilel is highly intelligent and well versed in arcane lore, but finds it difficult to speak with people and has been something of a wallflower throughout her life. As such, she can easily be taken advantage of by someone who gives her any attention, particularly if that person is both attractive and charming. If Lereilel realizes that Thaliydor's feelings are false, the last shreds of her confidence might finally break, leading her to do something potentially self-destructive unless someone steps in to save her.": "Loreilel（洛瑞蕾尔）非常聪明，精通奥术知识，但她发现很难与人交流，在她的一生中一直是个墙角花。因此，她很容易被那些给予她关注的人利用，特别是如果那个人既有魅力又很迷人的话。如果Lereilel（洛瑞蕾尔）意识到Thaliydor（萨利多）的感情是虚假的，她最后的自信可能会彻底崩溃，导致她做出潜在的自我毁灭行为，除非有人介入拯救她。",
	"One easy way for the characters to become involved with Lereilel is to have them hired by her master as guards. Ravin is concerned that he might be the target of an assassination attempt by an old enemy and wants the characters to protect him and his apprentice until he can track down the villain. Strangely, the archmage is more concerned about Lereilel than he is about himself and tells the characters to watch her carefully. Alternatively, they could be hired by Lereilel's father to check on his daughter and see how she is doing. Regardless of how the characters become involved, their arrival puts a major chink in Thaliydor's plans and forces the assassin's hand, as the half-elf hires a band of evil brigands to deal with the characters while he uses Lereilel as bait to make an attempt on the life of her master.": "一个让角色与莱瑞蕾尔（Lereilel）有所牵扯的简单方法是让她的主人雇佣他们作为护卫。拉文（Ravin）担心自己可能成为一名老敌人暗杀的目标，希望角色们保护他和他的学徒，直到他能找到那个恶棍。奇怪的是，大法师更关心莱瑞蕾尔而不是自己，并告诉角色们要仔细观察她。或者，他们可以被莱瑞蕾尔的父亲雇佣来查看他的女儿，看看她的情况如何。无论角色们如何参与，他们的到来都给萨利多（Thaliydor）的计划带来了重大变数，并迫使刺客出手，因为这位半精灵雇佣了一群邪恶的强盗来对付角色们，同时利用莱瑞蕾尔作为诱饵，试图对她的主人下手。",

	"Terindor Grayveil (CG male human 1st-level wizard) is a wiry lad of fifteen with unruly orange hair and deep blue eyes. An earnest and helpful soul, Terindor is also far smarter than most of the adults around him and has taken to the study of magic with natural aplomb. His master is Elgretta Mathelzor (LG female human 14th-level wizard [evoker]), a famous war wizard who is often away on military campaigns, leaving Terindor to fend for himself.": "Terindor Grayveil (混沌善良 男性 人类 1级法师) 是一个身材瘦弱的十五岁少年，头发蓬乱的橙色，深蓝色的眼睛。Terindor 是一个真诚而乐于助人的灵魂，他比周围大多数成年人都聪明，天生具备学习魔法的才华。他的导师是 Elgretta Mathelzor (守序善良 女性 人类 14级法师 [咒术师])，一位著名的战争法师，经常在军事战役中离开，让 Terindor 自己照料自己。",
	"Terindor was born to hard-working but luckless mercantile parents who gave everything they had to make the lives of their children better, even teaching them letters and history to help them establish themselves in the world. The family became crippled by debt, and rather than seeing her parents cast out onto the streets, Terindor's sister, Ileena, agreed to marry a lecherous noble in order to save the family business. Shortly thereafter, Terindor sought out the war wizard and begged to become her apprentice—a move that shocked his mother and father, even more so when Elgretta agreed. Since then, Terindor has worked hard at his training, moving forward in leaps and bounds even though his master is frequently absent.": "泰林多(Terindor)出生在勤劳但不幸的商人父母之家，他们为了让孩子们过上更好的生活而付出了一切，甚至教他们识字和历史，帮助他们在世界上立足。这个家庭因债务而陷入困境，泰林多的姐姐伊琳娜(Ileena)为了不让父母被赶出家门，同意嫁给一个好色的贵族，以拯救家族生意。不久之后，泰林多寻找了战争法师，并请求成为她的学徒——这一举动震惊了他的父母，更让埃尔格蕾塔(Elgretta)同意了。从那时起，泰林多努力地进行训练，取得了长足的进步，尽管他的导师经常不在身边。",
	"Terindor is a determined lad who consistently pushes himself to become a better wizard. While maintaining this focus, he frequently pauses his studies to help out those in need, whether by fixing the roof of a spinster's cottage or driving out giant rats from the local brewery. Well-liked by those in his community, he is also the only one not awestruck by his mistress, who is renowned for her success in singlehandedly destroying a horde of goblins and felling a mighty white dragon with a barrage of spells.": "泰林多尔(Terindor)是一个坚定的年轻人，他始终努力成为一名更优秀的巫师。在保持这种专注的同时，他经常中断学习来帮助那些需要帮助的人，无论是修理老处女小屋的屋顶，还是驱赶当地酿酒厂的巨鼠。他受到社区人们的喜爱，也是唯一一个不为他的女主人所惊叹的人，她以独自摧毁一群地精并用一连串法术击倒一只强大的白龙而闻名。",
	"Terindor's main reason for wanting to become stronger is to free Ileena from her forced marriage. Although he knows that Elgretta sympathizes with him, she has told him quite bluntly that seeking retribution against the noble is wrong and not something she can be part of.": "泰林多（Terindor）想变得更强大的主要原因是为了解救伊琳娜（Ileena）免于被迫婚姻。尽管他知道艾尔格蕾塔（Elgretta）对他表示同情，但她却很直率地告诉他，寻求对贵族报复是错误的，也不是她愿意参与的事情。",
	"While he is training, Terindor keeps his ear to the ground in the community for talk of passing adventurers, particularly those who don't care about breaking the rules but are still fundamentally good at heart. If he hears of the characters' deeds, he approaches them at his first opportunity and expresses his desire to help his sister out of her predicament. Terindor has nothing to give the characters in payment but promises to help them enchant their gear when he becomes a more powerful wizard. If the characters seem about to refuse his request, he offers them the services of Elgretta—a promise that he knows might cause him a lot of trouble in the future.": "在训练时，泰林多尔（Terindor）时刻留意社区中有关过往冒险者的传闻，尤其是那些虽然不拘小节，但内心仍然善良的人。如果他听说了角色们的事迹，他会在第一时间接近他们，并表达希望帮助他的姐姐摆脱困境的愿望。泰林多尔没有任何报酬可以给角色们，但承诺在他成为更强大的巫师后帮助他们给装备施加魔法。如果角色们似乎要拒绝他的请求，他会提供他的姐姐艾尔格蕾塔（Elgretta）的服务——他知道这个承诺可能会给他未来带来很多麻烦。",

	"Erolimar (LG male elf 1st-level wizard) is a young elf with sweeping silvery locks and amethyst eyes. Stout of limb, graceful and handsome, Erolimar seems almost like the perfect elf—yet despite these qualities, he has been cursed with only middling intelligence and wisdom, making him a poor choice as a wizard's apprentice. Nevertheless, he has been taken on by Taramind the Scorched (NE elf male 15th-level wizard [conjurer]), a mysterious elf with hideously burned features who is known for his dealings with elementals and fiends.": "Erolimar（LG 男性精灵1级法师）是一位年轻的精灵，拥有银色长发和紫晶般的眼睛。四肢粗壮，优雅英俊，Erolimar看起来几乎是完美的精灵——然而尽管拥有这些品质，他却被诅咒，智慧和智力只是中等水平，使他成为一个不太理想的法师学徒。尽管如此，他已被Taramind the Scorched（NE 男性精灵15级法师[召唤师]）收为门徒。Taramind是一位神秘的精灵，面容被严重烧伤，以与元素和恶魔打交道而闻名。",
	"Erolimar comes from a long line of accomplished spellcasters. Indeed, it was expected that young Erolimar would enroll at an esteemed college of magic when he came of age so he could follow in his forebears' footsteps. This would have been the case, had he passed the entrance exam. Soon, it became clear that Erolimar was not the paragon of wizardry his father and mother thought he would be. Dejected, he turned his back on magic to pursue the meaningful but far less prestigious role of hunter for his village.": "Erolimar（Erolimar）来自一系列杰出的咒术师。事实上，人们期望年轻的Erolimar在成年后能够就读一所著名的魔法学院，以便继承祖辈的遗志。如果他通过了入学考试，情况本应如此。很快，Erolimar并非他的父母所期望的巫术楷模这一事实变得清晰。受挫之后，他放弃了魔法，转而选择了为村庄担任猎人这一有意义但声望远低的角色。",
	"Just when it seemed that magic had left Erolimar behind, he was saved by Taramind, who approached the young elf to be his apprentice. At first fearful of the wizard's reputation, Erolimar finally accepted the offer and has taken to his new position with gusto, unaware that his master has taken him on to prepare Erolimar's soul for sacrifice to a fiend, whose life force he will then transfer into the young elf 's body.": "就在似乎魔法已经抛弃了埃罗利玛的时候，他被塔拉敏救了，后者走近这位年轻的精灵，希望他成为自己的学徒。一开始害怕这位巫师的名声，埃罗利玛最终接受了这个提议，并充满热情地担任起新职位，却不知道他的主人希望准备将埃罗利玛的灵魂献祭给一位恶魔，然后将恶魔的生命力转移到这位年轻精灵的身体中。",
	"Erolimar is a kind-hearted, generous, and naive individual who does not see a bad bone in anyone around him. Even Taramind, with his menacing demeanor and harsh teaching methods, does not set off Erolimar's alarm bells; he prefers to focus on his master's strengths, rather than than worry about his flaws. Erolimar is envied by many in his village for his good looks and natural agility, but they are also aware of his failings, and there are few who can hold a bad thought in their hearts for the elf for too long.": "Erolimar是一个善良、慷慨、天真的个体，他看不到周围任何人的坏心眼。即使是Taramind，以他威胁的态度和严厉的教学方法，也无法引起Erolimar的警觉；他更愿意专注于他主人的优点，而不是担心他的缺点。Erolimar因为英俊和天赋出众而被他村庄的许多人所羡慕，但他们也意识到他的缺点，很少有人能够对这位精灵心怀恶念太久。",
	"The characters are hired by the local elf population to investigate a spate of bizarre animal attacks in the vicinity of Taramind's mansion. The attacks have been violent and erratic, the animals in question extremely vicious and difficult to kill. During their investigation, the characters run into Erolimar, and the elf proves to be helpful on more than one occasion. Eventually (perhaps with Erolimar's help), they realize that the animals have become possessed by lesser fiends and that some sort of conjuration magic is responsible. It is at this point when Taramind begins to prepare the young elf for sacrifice, and it is up to the characters to save him. How this plays out is up to the GM, but Taramind is no pushover—his mansion is home to magic traps, bound fiends, and terrible golems.": "人物们被当地精灵族群雇佣，调查塔拉明庄园附近一系列奇怪的动物袭击事件。这些袭击行为既暴力又不规律，相关动物极为凶残且难以击败。在调查过程中，人物们遇到了埃洛利玛(Erolimar)，这位精灵在多个场合上都证明了自己的帮助性。最终（也许在埃洛利玛的帮助下），他们意识到这些动物已经被次级恶魔附身，某种召唤魔法是罪魁祸首。就在这时，塔拉明开始准备年轻精灵进行祭祀，而人物们则需要拯救他。这场戏如何发展取决于GM，但塔拉明并不是好对付的——他的庄园里设有魔法陷阱、被束缚的恶魔和可怕的魔像。",
	"I was a warrior before I became a wizard, a sword for hire who traveled the world looking for adventure. I made a name for myself as well. Perhaps you've heard of me? Arn's the name—Arn of Rowan.": "在我成为巫师之前，我是一名战士，一名雇佣剑客，周游世界寻找冒险。我也为自己赢得了声誉。也许你听说过我？我的名字是Arn—Rowan的Arn。",
	"Arn of Rowan (CN male human 12th-level fighter/2nd-level wizard) is a strapping man in his mid-thirties with long brown hair, a thick beard, and piercing black eyes. Tall and full of vigor, Arn seems like an odd choice for a wizard's apprentice, and his master, Jainara Meadowwands (LN female human 9th-level wizard [illusionist]), seems more like a harried wife than a teacher. Indeed, most people find their pairing to be odd, especially given that Arn is much more famous than his master.": "罗文的阿恩（混乱中立 男性 人类 12级战士/2级法师）是一个三十多岁的健壮男子，长着长长的棕色头发，浓密的胡须和炯炯有神的黑眼睛。高大而充满活力，阿恩似乎是一个奇怪的巫师学徒选择，而他的导师，梅多旺兹的贾娜拉（法师幻术师 混乱中立 女性 人类 9级），看起来更像一个忙碌的妻子而不是一位老师。事实上，大多数人都觉得他们的搭配很奇怪，尤其是考虑到阿恩比他的导师更有名。",
	"Arn began his career as a soldier in the army of a self-righteous duke who waged war against his neighbors under the pretense of dispensing justice. It was during this bloody time that Arn solidified his reputation as a vicious fighter with axe and shield, and once the duke had his fill of warfare, Arn forged his own career as a mercenary for hire, basing himself in the small town of Rowan, which he soon put on the map with his legendary exploits.": "阿恩（Arn）在一位自以为是的公爵的军队中开始了他的军旅生涯，这位公爵以分发正义为借口对邻国发动战争。正是在这段血腥的时期，阿恩以斧头和盾牌作战的凶猛声名渐起。一旦公爵厌倦了战争，阿恩便开始自己作为一名雇佣兵的职业生涯，在小镇罗文（Rowan）扎根，很快因他的传奇壮举而声名远扬。",
	"It was after one particularly harrowing mission that Arn drank too much ale at the local tavern and lost a bet to one of his companions, a bard who claimed that Arn could never master any trade but that of the blade. Haughtily, Arn took up the challenge and availed himself of the talents of Jainara Meadowwands, a mousy-haired woman and capable illusionist, agreeing to pay off her debts in exchange for becoming her pupil. Jainara accepted the deal, believing that Arn would quickly grow bored and leave—but much to her amazement, he not only stayed but quickly excelled as her student.": "在一次特别惊险的任务之后，Arn在当地酒馆喝了太多的麦酒，并输给了他的一个同伴，一个声称Arn除了剑之外永远无法掌握其他技能的吟游诗人。Arn傲慢地接受了挑战，利用了Jainara Meadowwands的才能，她是一位头发乌黑的女人，擅长幻术，同意帮助Arn还清她的债务，作为交换成为他的学徒。Jainara接受了这个交易，相信Arn会很快厌倦并离开，但令她惊讶的是，他不仅留了下来，而且很快就成为她的出色学生。",
	"Arn is a boisterous and carefree individual who has many scars and tales from his past. Naturally charismatic and with an unusually keen intellect, he would probably have been a lord by now if it were not for his chaotic nature. The fact that he is good at magecraft does not surprise Arn, since he is good at whatever he puts his mind to. What does surprise him, however, is that he actually enjoys the work. He has also grown quite fond of Jainara, and finds her presence strangely calming.": "阿恩是一个热情奔放、无忧无虑的个体，他有许多来自过去的伤疤和故事。他天生具有魅力，拥有异常敏锐的智慧，如果不是因为他混乱的本性，他现在可能已经成为一位领主了。阿恩擅长魔法也并不让他感到惊讶，因为无论他做什么，他都很擅长。然而，让他感到惊讶的是，他竟然真的喜欢这项工作。他也对贾娜拉产生了深厚的感情，发现她的存在竟然让他感到奇妙的平静。",
	"The characters are passing through the area when Rowan is attacked by a flight of wyvern-riding hobgoblins. Arn and Jainara are also present, and through their combined efforts they and the characters manage to turn back the attack. Jainara is injured during the fight, and it is at this stage that Arn decides to turn his back on the blade and try being a wizard full-time. Of course, being Arn of Rowan, he cannot let the culprits get away with hurting his master, so he offers the PCs his magic battleaxe if they track the hobgoblins back to their base and finish them off.": "当角色们穿过这个地区时，罗温被一群骑着翼龙的地精袭击了。阿恩和贾娜拉也在场，通过他们的共同努力，他们和角色们设法击退了袭击。在战斗中，贾娜拉受伤了，就在这个时候，阿恩决定放弃剑，全心全意地成为一名巫师。当然，作为罗温的阿恩，他不能让伤害他的主人的罪犯逍遥法外，所以他向玩家角色提供他的魔法战斧，如果他们追踪地精回到他们的基地并消灭他们。",

She also has a large, reddish birthmark on her left shoulder that she normally keeps hidden under her robes. Xelasora is serious and humble and possesses a razor-sharp mind. Her master is Dramothir Galefnir (LG male dwarf 12th-level wizard [abjurer]), who in addition to being a learned mage is also a renowned artisan and jeweler.": "Xelasora（LN女性龙裔1级巫师/1级法师）是一位优雅的龙裔少女，有着混合蓝色和绿色鳞片，额头上有四根向后梳的短角，以及大大的琥珀色眼睛。她的左肩上还有一个大大的红色胎记，通常被她藏在长袍下面。Xelasora是认真谦逊的，拥有一颗锋利的头脑。她的导师是Dramothir Galefnir（LG男性矮人12级法师[护卫者]），除了是一位博学的法师外，他还是一位著名的工匠和珠宝商。",
	"The youngest of seven siblings, Xelasora lived a happy childhood, until the disastrous day when a red dragon attacked her community and killed the rest of her family. Mentally and emotionally scarred by the experience, Xelasora withdrew into herself after she was placed in an orphanage. She was ostracized by the other children in the orphanage, who were mostly human and considered her little more than a monster. Eventually, her pent-up emotions boiled over and she unleashed some of her latent magic, setting fire to the clothing of one of her tormentors. This act led to her being expelled from the orphanage and forced to live on the streets, where she barely managed to stay alive by using her powers. Finally, when all hope seemed lost, Xelasora was taken in by the mage Dramothir, a dwarf who was intrigued by her intelligence and wit, and who was a natural sucker for a damsel in distress. Since then, Xelasora has done her best to be a dutiful apprentice and astutely handles Dramothir's busy schedule.": "作为七个兄弟姐妹中最小的，赛拉索拉（Xelasora）度过了一个幸福的童年，直到一天，一只红龙袭击了她的社区，杀死了她的家人。经历这场灾难后，赛拉索拉在被送进孤儿院后变得心理和情感上受到了创伤。她被孤儿院里的其他孩子排斥，他们大多是人类，认为她不过是个怪物。最终，她憋在心里的情绪爆发了，释放出了一些潜在的魔法，点燃了其中一个折磨她的人的衣服。这一举动导致她被孤儿院开除，被迫流落街头，凭借自己的力量勉强维持生计。最终，在一切希望似乎都已失去时，赛拉索拉被法师德拉莫西尔（Dramothir）收留，他是一位矮人，被她的智慧和机智所吸引，也是一个天生的救援者。从那时起，赛拉索拉尽力成为一名尽职的学徒，并聪明地处理德拉莫西尔繁忙的日程安排。",
	"Xelasora is the best student that any wizard could hope for. She pursues both her magical studies and her mundane duties with the same rigorous attention to detail and is faultless in her execution. Her poised exterior, however, conceals a tormented soul. She constantly doubts herself and is worried that she could lose control of her sorcerous abilities if she becomes flustered or upset. The deaths of her family and the trouble she faced at the orphanage also still weigh on her heavily, and lately she has been plagued with dreams of fire and shadowy flying shapes, causing her to suddenly awaken in terror.": "Xelasora (泽拉索拉) 是任何巫师都希望拥有的最优秀的学生。她对魔法研究和日常职责都保持着严谨的注意力，执行起来毫无瑕疵。然而，她镇定的外表掩盖了一个受折磨的灵魂。她经常怀疑自己，担心如果变得慌乱或沮丧，就会失去对她的巫术能力的控制。她家人的死亡和在孤儿院遭遇的困难仍然沉重地压在她心头，最近她被火焰和阴影飞行形状的梦魇困扰，导致她突然惊醒。",
	"Xelasora's magic comes from a bit of theft: in her younger days, she stole a set of scrolls from an ancient red dragon. The dragon still exists in the form of a terrible undead monstrosity, and it shares a strange link with the young dragonborn that allows the two of them to share dreams and images of their lives. By the time the characters enter the picture, the dragon is close to discovering Xelasora's location—and when it does so, it plans to slay her and recover its scrolls. Before this event comes to pass, the characters have a chance to stop it, either by destroying the dragon or somehow trapping it. Of course, defeating an undead dragon is no easy feat; depending on the characters' level, the GM might want to lead them up to the event with battles against the dragon's servants in the form of ghouls, trolls, vampires, and lesser evil dragons.": "赛拉索拉(Xelasora)的魔法源自一点偷窃：在她年轻的时候，她从一只古老的红龙那里偷走了一套卷轴。那条龙如今以可怕的不死怪物的形式存在，它与年轻的龙裔之间有着奇怪的联系，使两者能分享彼此生活的梦境和图像。当角色们出现在故事中时，这条龙已经接近发现赛拉索拉的位置——一旦发现，它计划杀死她并夺回卷轴。在这事件发生之前，角色们有机会阻止它，要么是通过摧毁这条龙，要么是以某种方式困住它。当然，打败一只不死龙并不容易；根据角色的等级，GM可能希望通过与龙的仆从——如食尸鬼、巨魔、吸血鬼和次等邪恶龙——进行战斗来引导他们迎接这一事件。",
	"Golems and similar constructs are common features in a wizard's home. The most powerful mages have access to even more dangerous and complex automatons.

	"If the GM allows the use of any of these variant familiars by player characters, it might or might not be necessary for the would-be master to start the process by casting {@spell find familiar}. Either way, a variant familiar is an actual creature (not a spirit) that serves at its own discretion, obeying its master's commands only when doing so does not immediately bring it harm, and it will not hesitate to end the link with its master as a matter of self-preservation. Unlike standard familiars, a variant familiar does not disappear if it drops to 0 hit points; it simply dies or falls unconscious (GM's choice).": "如果GM允许玩家角色使用这些变种使魔中的任何一种，那么对于准备成为使魔主人的人来说，也许需要开始通过施放{@spell find familiar}来启动这个过程，也可能不需要。无论哪种方式，变种使魔都是一个实际的生物（而非精灵），它会自行决定是否效忠于主人的命令，只有在这样做不会立即给它带来伤害时才会服从，它会毫不犹豫地终止与主人的联系以自我保护为重。与标准使魔不同，如果一个变种使魔的生命值降至0，它不会消失；它会简单地死亡或陷入昏迷（由GM决定）。",

To determine which type of madness emerges, refer to the {@table Indefinite Madness|KPDM} table.": "在未能通过豁免检定时，生物会获得1点虚空污染。生物可以累积等于其熟练加值+其魅力调整值（最少2点）的虚空污染而不受伤害。当生物的虚空污染超过该数值时，它会患上一种持续疯狂，并且其虚空污染总量重置为0。要确定出现哪种类型的疯狂，请参考{@table Indefinite Madness|KPDM}表。",
	"Instead of bearing this scar on its psyche, a creature can choose to channel the Void's influence into a physical change, known as a flesh warp. The Void can produce an infinite variety of these effects, ranging from subtle to terrifying; the {@table Flesh Warps|KPDM} table offers a number of possibilities. A creature that has any flesh warp has disadvantage on Charisma checks involving a creature not of the Void for any purpose other than intimidation.": "在承受这种心灵创伤的代替方式，生物可以选择将虚空的影响转化为一种物理变化，称为肉体扭曲 (`Flesh Warp`)。虚空可以产生无限种类的效果，从微妙到可怕不等；{@table Flesh Warps|KPDM} 表格提供了许多可能性。拥有任何肉体扭曲的生物在与非虚空生物进行除恐吓外任何目的的魅力检定时，都会获得劣势。",
	"On either the {@table Indefinite Madness|KPDM} table or the {@table Flesh Warps|KPDM} table, a die roll dictates the outcome unless the GM decides otherwise. Under no circumstances should a player be allowed to choose a desired result.": "在{@table Indefinite Madness|KPDM}桌或{@table Flesh Warps|KPDM}桌上，除非GM另有决定，否则骰子的点数决定结果。在任何情况下，玩家都不应被允许选择所需的结果。",
	"A {@spell greater restoration} spell removes 1 point of Void taint from the target, in addition to curing the target's indefinite madness, if the creature succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.": "一个{@spell greater restoration}法术可以从目标身上移除1点虚空污染，并在目标成功通过DC 15的魅力豁免检定后，治愈目标的无限疯狂。",
	"Flesh warps are permanent manifestations of the Void within the body of a tainted creature and are incredibly difficult to remove. A {@spell regenerate} spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a creature of a flesh warp.": "肉体扭曲是虚空在被污染生物体内永久显现的表现，极其难以清除。需要使用{@spell regenerate}法术或更强大的魔法才能摆脱肉体扭曲。",
	"The work of author H. P. Lovecraft—the so-called \"Cthulhu mythos\"—has been a cornerstone of RPG storytelling since E. Gary Gygax immortalized its influence in his \"Inspirational and Educational Reading\" list. Taking its name from Lovecraft's famous story, \"The Call of Cthulhu,\" the mythos has become the backdrop for a subgenre of fiction sometimes called cosmic horror. At the foundation of cosmic horror are two ideas: that the human mind is too tiny and weak to comprehend more than the barest glimmer of the vastness of the universe and the alien mysteries it contains; and that among those mysteries are entities so ancient, powerful, and malevolent that they could extinguish Earth's insignificant civilization without caring or even noticing.": "作者H. P. Lovecraft的作品——所谓的“克苏鲁神话”——自E. Gary Gygax在他的“启发性和教育性阅读”清单中永恒地铭记其影响以来，一直是RPG叙事的基石。神话的名称取自Lovecraft的著名故事《克苏鲁的呼唤》，已经成为一种被称为宇宙恐怖的小说亚流的背景。宇宙恐怖的基础是两个观念：人类的思维太微小和脆弱，无法理解宇宙的浩瀚和其中包含的外星奥秘的一丝一毫；而在这些奥秘之中，有着古老、强大和邪恶的实体，它们可以毫不在意甚至察觉不到地扑灭地球微不足道的文明。",
	"With that in mind, this section explores those \"hidden and fathomless worlds of strange life which may pulsate in the gulfs beyond the stars\" that Lovecraft and his contemporaries pioneered in their strange fiction. Herein you will find a host of forbidden secrets and eldritch lore; a clandestine sort of magic that is full of both cosmic potential and horrific consequences, and knowledge of which erodes the sanity of all who pursue it.": "考虑到这一点，本节探讨了洛夫克拉夫特（Lovecraft）及其同时代人在他们奇异小说中开拓的那些“隐藏和深不可测的奇异生命世界，可能在星辰之外的深渊中脉动”。在这里，您将发现一系列禁忌的秘密和神秘的知识；一种秘密的魔法，充满了宇宙潜力和可怕的后果，追求这种魔法知识的人都会失去理智。",
	"The spells in this category resemble Void magic in that they harness the power of the Void, but they are not beholden to it. Mythos magic uses the Great Old Ones as a conduit for its power, while Void magic originates from the Void itself (a place of negation and emptiness that devours the cosmos, not an entity).": "这个类别中的法术类似于虚空魔法，因为它们利用虚空的力量，但并不受其束缚。神话魔法利用邪神作为其力量的导管，而虚空魔法源自虚空本身（一个吞噬宇宙的否定和空无之地，而非一个实体）。",
	"Mythos spells can be learned by anyone with magical aptitude—any character who has the ability to cast spells can add mythos spells to their spell list. All other characters can acquire a mythos spell only if they learn it from one of the forbidden and furtive tomes of the Cthulhu mythos or see the spell being cast.": "神话法术可以被任何有魔法天赋的人学会—任何有施法能力的角色都可以将神话法术添加到他们的法术列表中。其他所有角色只有在从克苏鲁神话的禁忌和隐秘典籍中学习或看到法术被施展时才能获得神话法术。",
	"But this power comes at great risk. Casters of mythos magic literally exchange their sanity for magical ability. Unless a character is protected by great Wisdom or a bulwark of arcane wards, using these spells will certainly lead to madness.": "但这种力量伴随着巨大的风险。神话魔法的施法者实际上是用精神力量换取了魔法能力。除非角色拥有极高的智慧或者一道强大的奥术结界来保护自己，否则使用这些咒语肯定会导致疯狂。",
	"Mythos magic is typically the province of {@class wizard||wizards}, although any spellcaster can learn these spells under the right circumstances.": "神话魔法通常是{@class wizard||wizards}的专属领域，尽管在适当的情况下任何施法者都可以学习这些咒语。",
	"{@note See the {@filter spells page|spells|source=KPDM|subschool=mythos} to browse and sort spells.}": "{@note See the {@filter spells page|spells|source=KPDM|subschool=mythos}浏览和排序法术。",
	"The following spells are presented in alphabetical order. When a mythos spell has a verbal component, the caster must utter it in Void Speech.": "以下咒语按字母顺序呈现。当神话咒语具有口头成分时，施法者必须用虚空语言（Void Speech）念出来。",
	"When the stars were right, they could plunge from world to world through the sky...": "当星星处于正确的位置时，它们可以穿越天空从一个世界到另一个世界...",
	"Mythos magic seethes with the unnameable secrets of the Great Old Ones—alien beings from beyond space and time whose warped, eldritch minds are immeasurably superior to our own and whose sinister, loathsome agendas challenge not only our sanity but our very existence.": "神话魔法充满了那些无法言说的伟大古老者的秘密——来自时空之外的外星生物，其扭曲、神秘的思维远远超越我们自己，其邪恶、可憎的议程不仅挑战着我们的理智，也挑战着我们的存在。",
	"Many of the spells in this section refer to and take inspiration from specific Great Old Ones and Elder Gods of the Cthulhu mythos. These names can serve as narrative waypoints as you chart the cosmic apocalypse of a mythos‑laden campaign. In the same spirit of collaboration that fueled Lovecraft's circle of writers, you should feel free to develop your own Mythic entities.": "这一部分的许多法术参考并汲取了克苏鲁神话中特定的上古之神和长者神的灵感。这些名字可以作为叙事的里程碑，帮助你描绘一个充满神话元素的宇宙末日战役。在与洛夫克拉夫特的作家圈子一样的合作精神中，你应该随意发展自己的神话实体。",
	"Some of the Great Old Ones and Elder Gods central to mythos magic include: Cthulhu, Yog‑Sothoth (the Beyond‑One), Shub‑Niggurath (the Black Goat of the Woods), Bokrug, Tsathoggua, Koth, Bran Mak Morn, Nodens, Nyarlathotep (the Crawling Chaos), Hastur, Hriggala (the Jaws of Vardesain), the Magnum Innominandum (the Not‑to‑Be‑Named One), Yig (the Father of Serpents), and the White Goddess.": "一些与神话魔法密切相关的古老伟大者和上古之神包括：克苏鲁 (Cthulhu), 犹格索托斯 (Yog‑Sothoth)（超越者）, 舒布‑尼古拉斯 (Shub‑Niggurath)（森林中的黑山羊）, 博克鲁格 (Bokrug), 萨索古亚 (Tsathoggua), 科斯 (Koth), 布兰·马克·莫恩 (Bran Mak Morn), 诺登斯 (Nodens), 尼亚拉托提普 (Nyarlathotep)（爬行混沌）, 哈斯图尔 (Hastur), 赫里加拉 (Hriggala)（瓦德赛因之颚）, 无名大权 (Magnum Innominandum)（不可名状者）, 伊格 (Yig)（蛇之父）, 以及白色女神。",
	"If antiquity looks upon the stories of Tolkien and dreams of fated rings, or reflects upon the multiverse of Moorcock's White Wolf and thinks of cursed swords, then surely the Cthulhu mythos will be remembered for its magical tomes. Described here are three of the most infamous installments in the mythos atheneum: the accursed {@i Necronomicon}, Robert E. Howard's {@i Nameless Cults}, and the ubiquitous {@i Book of Eibon}. Mythos spells can be learned only from a mythos grimoire like these or through direct contact with a mythos spellcaster—and those grimoires and casters take many abhorrent forms.": "如果古代审视托尔金的故事，梦想着命运之戒，或者反思穆尔科克的白狼多元宇宙，想到被诅咒的剑，那么克苏鲁神话必将因其神秘的魔法典籍而被铭记。这里描述了神话图书馆中三个最臭名昭著的部分：被诅咒的{@i Necronomicon}，罗伯特·E·霍华德的{@i Nameless Cults}，以及无处不在的{@i Book of Eibon}。只有从这样的神话典籍或直接接触神话咒术师才能学习神话咒语——而那些典籍和咒术师有着多种可憎的形态。",
	"With a multiverse-wide perspective in mind, these books are considered to be translations of the \"real world\" originals—which is to say, they come from the alternate-history Earth of Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos setting, including elements of Howard's Hyborian Age. How they made their way through time and space to wind up on alien worlds or your own setting is the stuff of splendidly macabre speculation (and ultimately is up to you, the GM). One thing's for sure: these tomes are beyond precious to all who hunger for the eldritch knowledge of the Great Old Ones, and such longings aren't restricted to humanity and near-humanity. There also exist multitudes of odious aberrations, monstrosities, fiends, and worse entities who will stop at nothing to possess these tomes.": "考虑到整个多元宇宙的视角，这些书籍被认为是“现实世界”原作的翻译——也就是说，它们来自洛夫克拉夫特克苏鲁神话设定的另类历史地球，包括霍华德的海伯利安时代的元素。它们是如何穿越时间和空间来到外星世界或你自己的设定中的，这是一个充满了精彩阴森推测的故事（最终由你，GM，决定）。有一点可以肯定：这些卷轴对所有渴望了解上古邪神知识的人都是无比珍贵的，这种渴望不仅限于人类和类人种。还存在着许多可憎的畸变、怪物、恶魔和更糟糕的实体，它们将不惜一切代价来获取这些卷轴。",
	"Every world has an abundance of villainous types that stand in the way of what the heroes want to accomplish. Two more examples of that sort are presented below: the {@class cleric} who seduces followers instead of saving them, and the grisly {@class wizard} known as the {@class wizard||necrophage|necrophage|KPDM}.": "每个世界都有大量邪恶的角色，他们阻碍英雄们想要实现的目标。以下是另外两个这种类型的例子：{@class cleric}，他诱惑追随者而不是拯救他们；以及那个可怕的{@class wizard}，被称为{@class wizard||necrophage|necrophage|KPDM}。",
	"Wizards and other practitioners of magic create traps that use spells as much as they use physical objects; some of these hindrances have features in common with pits and spear traps, while others rely on a series of finely wrought glyphs or enchanted components that require arcane knowledge to identify, much less disarm. A small collection of these traps is provided here.": "巫师和其他魔法实践者创造的陷阱不仅使用物理物体，还使用法术；一些这样的障碍与坑洞和矛陷阱有共同之处，而其他的则依赖于一系列精巧制作的符文或附魔组件，需要奥术知识才能识别，更不用说解除了。这里提供了一小部分这样的陷阱。",
	"This section contains riffs and twists for three classic spells: {@spell charm person}, {@spell fireball}, and {@spell raise dead}. These experimental variations are meant to entertain players and GMs who are more experienced with—or even jaded by—the standard versions. Changes affect both flavor and implementation, so the spells look different when cast, have different power levels, and even have radically different effects.": "这一部分包含了三个经典法术{@spell charm person}、{@spell fireball}和{@spell raise dead}的变体和变化。这些实验性的变化旨在娱乐那些对标准版本更有经验甚至已经审美疲劳的玩家和GM。这些变化影响了法术的风格和实施方式，因此当施放时，这些法术看起来不同，具有不同的能量水平，甚至有着截然不同的效果。",

Some are similar in effect to the original but with altered story elements, and others have more pronounced tweaks to their effects on the game.": "每个部分涵盖了三个标准法术中的一个，其中包含了对其主题的变化。有些效果类似于原始版本，但故事元素有所改变，而其他一些则对游戏效果进行了更明显的调整。",

Though some might consider the idea of a fixed destiny fatalistic, the bards of this college are inspired by this viewpoint. One may not choose the manner of one's death, but one can choose how to meet it, and that idea is at the heart of this college. An insect might be caught in a spider's web. Whether it lives or dies, its struggles ultimately shake the web in its entirety, and it might free itself through such effort. The struggle affects all things, however remotely connected they might be, whereas the insect that merely accepts its death leaves not even a ripple behind. To confront fate, to embrace the wyrd and whatever it brings, is to have the power to shake the world and make it take notice.": "卫德歌者学院（College of Wyrdsingers）的吟游诗人信奉“命运”（wyrd），这是一个以同名现象为中心的哲学。命运是那将会发生的事，与命运和宿命等概念紧密相连。虽然有些人可能认为固定命运的想法是宿命论的，但这个学院的吟游诗人却受到这种观点的启发。一个人可能无法选择自己的死法，但可以选择如何面对它，这个想法正是这个学院的核心。一只昆虫可能被困在蜘蛛网中。无论它生还是死，它的挣扎最终会震动整个蜘蛛网，通过这种努力它可能会自救。这种挣扎会影响所有事物，无论它们之间的联系有多遥远，而仅仅接受死亡的昆虫甚至不会留下一丝涟漪。直面命运，拥抱命运和它所带来的一切，就是拥有震动世界并引起注意的力量。",

When the spell ends, the creature knows it was {@condition charmed} by you.": "你尝试魅惑一个你能看到的人形生物。它进行一次感知豁免，如果你或你的同伴正在与它战斗或威胁它，则具有优势。如果豁免失败，人形生物会保持{@condition charmed}，直到法术持续时间结束，直到你或你的任何同伴对其造成伤害，或者直到满月升起。这个{@condition charmed}生物会把你视为友好的熟人。当法术结束时，生物会知道它被你{@condition charmed}。",
	"You return a dead creature you touch to a ghostly and incorporeal form, provided it has been dead no longer than 10 days. The creature can see and hear, and it can speak in a hollow, sepulchral tone if it chooses to. Whether it's willing to speak to you depends on its whim and its prior relationship with you, if any.": "你可以将你触摸的死亡生物转变为幽灵般的无实体形态，前提是它死亡时间不超过10天。这个生物可以看见和听见，如果选择的话，它可以用空洞、坟墓般的语调说话。它是否愿意和你交谈取决于它的心情和它与你之前的关系，如果有的话。",
	"The affected creature is not undead; it is alive but incorporeal, with 1 hit point. It can't interact with the physical world, attack or cause damage, or cast spells. It is immune to nonmagical damage. It can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but it takes {@damage 1d10} force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. It regains hit points normally through resting or spending hit dice but never recovers hit points via magic spells, items, or potions.": "受影响的生物不是不死生物；它是有生命的，但是无实体，只有1点生命值。它无法与物质世界互动、攻击或造成伤害，也无法施放法术。它对非魔法伤害免疫。它可以穿过生物和物体，就像它们是艰难地形一样，但如果它在物体内结束自己的回合，它会受到{@damage 1d10}的力量伤害。它可以通过休息或消耗生命骰来恢复生命值，但永远不会通过魔法法术、物品或药水恢复生命值。",
	"This spell also neutralizes any poison and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life.": "这个法术还会中和生物死亡时受到的任何毒素，并治愈非魔法疾病。这个法术不会清除魔法疾病、诅咒或类似效果；如果在施法前没有清除这些效果，那么当生物复活时它们会生效。",
	"The spell also closes mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.": "这个法术也可以治愈致命伤，但不能恢复缺失的身体部位。如果生物缺少对其生存至关重要的身体部位或器官，比如头部，那么这个法术会自动失败。",
	"Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target has a −4 penalty to saving throws and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.": "死而复生是一场磨难。目标在豁免 throws 和能力检定时受到 -4 的惩罚。每当目标完成一次长休时，惩罚值减少 1，直到消失。",
	"A creature affected by {@i raise ghost} is restored to normal, physical life by {@spell raise dead} or comparable magic. {@i Raise ghost} has no effect if cast on an undead creature.": "受到{@i raise ghost}影响的生物可以通过{@spell raise dead}或类似的魔法恢复正常的生理状态。如果对不死生物施放{@i Raise ghost}，则没有任何效果。",
	"This spell is identical to {@spell raise dead} in every way except duration; the creature is restored to life for only 24 hours. The spell can be recast on the same creature, but on the second and subsequent castings, the caster must roll a {@dice d20}. If the roll equals or is less than the number of prior castings on the same creature, the spell fails and cannot affect that creature again. Each new casting resets the clock to 24 hours; it doesn't stack another 24 hours onto a previous casting.": "这个法术在每个方面都与{@spell raise dead}相同，唯一不同的是持续时间；生物只能在24小时内复活。这个法术可以在同一生物身上再次施放，但在第二次及以后的施放中，施法者必须投掷一个{@dice d20}。如果投掷的结果等于或小于之前在同一生物身上施放的次数，法术会失败，无法再次影响该生物。每次新的施法都会将时间重置为24小时；它不会在之前的施法上再叠加另外的24小时。",
	"This spell is identical to {@spell raise ghost|KPDM} in every way, except the ghostly figure can manipulate, hold, or carry objects weighing up to 5 pounds. Note that while 5 pounds of force is enough to pick up many melee weapons, it's not sufficient to wield one in combat, or to draw a bow.": "这个法术在每个方面都与{@spell raise ghost|KPDM}相同，唯一的区别是幽灵般的形象可以操纵、拿着或携带重量达5磅的物体。请注意，虽然5磅的力量足以拿起许多近战武器，但不足以在战斗中使用，或者拉弓。",
	"This spell is identical to {@spell raise dead}, except it simultaneously raises two creatures with opposite alignments. For example, if you raise a Lawful Good paladin, then somewhere nearby, a Chaotic Evil warrior of similar power also returns to life. The second corpse must be within 100 miles. The two raised creatures have a vague sense of the direction and distance to their nemesis. They aren't compelled to battle one another or even to seek each other out. Their lives are, however, inextricably bound together in such a way that if either of them dies, the other also drops dead instantly.": "这个法术与{@spell raise dead}完全相同，但同时复活两个具有相反取向的生物。例如，如果你复活了一个守序善良的圣骑士，那么附近某处也会复活一个混乱邪恶的同等实力的战士。第二具尸体必须在100英里内。这两个被复活的生物会模糊感知到彼此的方向和距离。他们并不被迫互相战斗，甚至不一定要寻找对方。然而，他们的生命是紧密相连的，如果其中一个死亡，另一个也会立刻死去。",
	"Evil NPCs brought back with raise nemesis typically see it as an opportunity to create every sort of trouble imaginable. If the spell is cast on a creature of true Neutral alignment, only that creature is restored to life.": "通常，用复活劲敌(`raise nemesis`)复活的邪恶NPC会将其视为创造各种难以想象的麻烦的机会。如果这个法术施加在一个真正中立(`true Neutral`)阵营的生物身上，那么只有那个生物会被复活。",
	"This spell is identical to {@spell raise dead}, but it works only on a creature that died of old age. The spell grants the raised elder one additional year of life. The raised creature has entirely white hair, its eyes are weak, and it loses 2 points each from Strength and Constitution; no magic less potent than a {@spell wish} can restore these lost points. In all other respects, the creature can live out its life normally until the added year elapses.": "这个法术与{@spell raise dead}完全相同，但只能对死于老年的生物施展。该法术让复活的老者额外多活一年。复活的生物头发全白，眼睛变得虚弱，力量和体质各减少2点；除非使用{@spell wish}这样强大的魔法，否则无法恢复这些丢失的属性点。在其他方面，生物可以正常地度过其余生命，直到额外的一年结束。",
	"{@i Raise elder} has no effect if it's cast on the same creature a second time.": "如果{@i Raise elder}在同一生物身上施放第二次，则无效。",
	"This spell is identical to {@spell raise dead}, except it empowers you to impose a {@spell geas} on the creature you raise. The targeted soul can opt to decline the geas, in which case it isn't restored to life. If the creature accepts your geas, it must complete the task within 30 days. If it accepts but fails to meet the conditions of the geas, it dies on the dawn of the 31st day and its spirit again departs the mortal world. If it accomplishes the task, it's free to live out the remainder of its restored life as it chooses.": "这个法术与{@spell raise dead}完全相同，只是它赋予你能力对你复活的生物施加{@spell geas}。被选中的灵魂可以选择拒绝这个神秘力量，如果这样做，它将不会被复活。如果生物接受了你的神秘力量，它必须在30天内完成任务。如果它接受了但未能满足神秘力量的条件，它将在第31天的黎明时死去，它的灵魂再次离开这个世界。如果它完成了任务，它可以自由选择如何度过其恢复的余生。",
	"A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range, where it blossoms with a low roar to engulf a single creature in searing flame.

	"A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range, where it slowly ignites the air itself with phlogiston. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere around the target point takes {@damage 4d6} fire damage, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Every target that takes damage takes the same amount of damage again at the start of your next two turns unless it uses an action to put out the flames on its clothing, hair, and other accoutrements. Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried are also ignited.": "一道明亮的光线从你伸出的手指闪过，照射到你选择的范围内的一个点，那里慢慢点燃了空气中的火气。目标点周围20英尺半径范围内的每个生物会受到{@damage 4d6}火焰伤害，或者在成功的敏捷豁免才能下受到一半伤害。每个受到伤害的目标在你接下来的两个回合开始时都会再次受到同样数量的伤害，除非它使用一个动作来扑灭身上的火焰、头发和其他装饰物。区域内未被穿戴或携带的易燃物品也会被点燃。",

	"A bolt of flame streaks from your finger toward a point you choose within range, then explodes into an inferno of flame. Each creature within 20 feet of the explosion takes {@damage 7d6} fire damage, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw.": "一道火焰之箭从你的手指射向你选择的范围内的一个点，然后爆炸成一团火焰之焰。爆炸范围内的每个生物受到{@damage 7d6}火焰伤害，或者在成功的敏捷豁免才能中受到一半伤害。",
	"Immediately afterward, a second bolt of flame streaks from that explosion to a second target point you can see exactly 40 feet from the first explosion. It explodes again at the second target point, causing another {@damage 7d6} fire damage (halved by a successful Dexterity saving throw). Then the flame jumps instantly again to a third target point, also within your line of sight and exactly 40 feet from the second explosion, where it detonates for the final time with identical results.": "紧接着，第二道火焰闪电从爆炸点射向第二个目标点，距离第一个爆炸点正好40英尺。它再次在第二个目标点爆炸，造成另外{@damage 7d6}点火焰伤害（成功的敏捷豁免可减半）。然后火焰立即跳至第三个目标点，同样在你的视线范围内，距离第二次爆炸点正好40英尺，最终再次引爆，效果相同。",
	"Note that for the second and third bursts, the flame jumps exactly 40 feet—never more, never less—and if any part of a burst area overlaps the area of a previous burst, the burst fails to happen and the spell ends immediately.": "请注意，对于第二和第三次爆发，火焰跳跃的距离恰好为40英尺—不多不少—如果任何一个爆发区域与之前爆发区域重叠，那么爆发将失败并立即结束法术。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 7d6|6-9|1d6} for each slot level above 6th.": "当你使用7级或更高级别的法术位施放此法术时，伤害将每超过6级的位级增加{@scaledamage 7d6|6-9|1d6}。",
	"You temporarily make a creature within range less appealing to others. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw against your spell. On a successful save, the spell is ineffective. On a failed save, the next time the creature makes a Charisma check before the spell ends, roll a {@dice d6} and subtract the result from the roll. The spell then ends.": "你暂时让范围内的生物变得不那么吸引人。目标需要对你的法术进行一次感知豁免。在成功豁免时，法术无效。在失败豁免时，生物在法术结束前下次进行魅力检定时，投掷一个{@dice d6}的骰子，并从检定结果中减去这个数值。然后法术结束。",
	"You imbue a terrifying visage onto a gourd and toss it ahead of you to a spot of your choosing within range. Each creature within 15 feet of that spot takes {@damage 6d8} psychic damage and becomes {@condition frightened} of you for 1 minute; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the fright. A creature {@condition frightened} in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.": "你将一个可怕的面孔灌注到一个葫芦上，然后将其投掷到你选择范围内的一个地点。距离那个地点15英尺内的每个生物会受到{@damage 6d8}点精神伤害，并在1分钟内变成你的{@condition frightened}；成功的感知豁免可以减半伤害并消除恐惧效果。被这种方式影响的生物会在每个自己的回合结束时重复进行豁免才能，成功则结束对自己的影响。",

	"You cloak yourself in a protective field that absorbs incoming magic, rejuvenating your spell slots. When you are the target of a spell (including spells that affect multiple targets, but not area spells such as fireball), make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell has no effect on you and is absorbed by the field. You regain a spell slot of the same level as the spell that was cast against you.

	"You adjust the location of an ally to a better tactical position. You move one willing creature within range 5 feet. This movement does not provoke {@action opportunity attack||opportunity attacks}. The creature moves bodily through the intervening space (as opposed to teleporting), so there can be no physical obstacle (such as a wall or a door) in the path.": "你调整一个盟友的位置，使其处于更有利的战术位置。你可以移动一个愿意的生物，距离范围为5英尺。这次移动不会引发{@action opportunity attack||opportunity attacks}。生物在移动时会身体穿越中间空间（而不是瞬间移动），因此路径中不能有物理障碍（如墙壁或门）。",

	"You clap your hands, setting off a chain of tiny events that culminate in throwing off an enemy's aim. When an enemy makes a ranged attack with a weapon or a spell that hits one of your allies, this spell causes the enemy to reroll the attack roll unless the enemy makes a successful Charisma saving throw. The attack is resolved using the lower of the two rolls (effectively giving the enemy disadvantage on the attack).": "你拍了拍手，引发了一系列微小事件，最终导致敌人瞄准失误。当敌人使用武器或法术进行远程攻击击中你的盟友时，这个法术会让敌人重新投掷攻击骰，除非敌人成功进行一个魅力豁免。攻击结果使用两次投掷中较低的那个（实际上让敌人在攻击时处于劣势）。",

Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit.

	"When you cast this spell using a 3rd-level spell slot, it can be used on the corpse of a Large humanoid to create a Large {@creature ghoul}. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, this spell creates a {@creature ghast}, but the material component changes to an onyx gemstone worth at least 200 gp.": "当你使用3级法术位施放这个法术时，它可以用在一个大型人形生物的尸体上，创造一个大型{@creature ghoul}。当你使用4级或更高级别的法术位施放这个法术时，这个法术创造一个{@creature ghast}，但材料成分变为价值至少200gp的缟玛瑙宝石。",
	"This spell creates an undead servant from a pile of bones or from the corpse of a Large or Huge humanoid within range.

	"The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying your commands. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again while you have it controlled.

	"The paper or parchment must be folded into the shape of an animal before casting the spell. It then becomes an animated paper animal of the kind the folded paper most closely resembles. The creature uses the stat block of any {@filter beast that has a challenge rating of 0|bestiary|type=beast|challenge rating=[&0;&0]}. It is made of paper, not flesh and bone, but it can do anything the real creature can do: a paper {@creature owl} can fly and attack with its talons, a paper {@creature frog} can swim without disintegrating in water, and so forth. It follows your commands to the best of its ability, including carrying messages to a recipient whose location you know.": "在施放咒语之前，纸张或羊皮必须折叠成动物的形状。然后它会变成最接近折叠纸张的动物形象的一只动态纸张动物。这个生物使用任何{@filter beast that has a challenge rating of 0|bestiary|type=beast|challenge rating=[&0;&0]}的属性块。它由纸张制成，而不是血肉和骨头，但它可以做任何真实生物可以做的事情：一只纸{@creature owl}可以飞行并用它的爪子攻击，一只纸{@creature frog}可以在水中游泳而不会分解，等等。它会尽力按照你的命令行动，包括传递消息给你知道位置的收件人。",

	"This spell creates a link between you and a nearby source of arcane power, allowing you to draw on its strength to bolster your spellcasting ability. When you cast a spell, you can use a bonus action to draw on the link. Doing so means you expend no spell slots to cast the spell, the energy instead comes from the external power.": "这个法术在你和附近的一处奥术能量源之间建立了一条联系，让你能够借助它的力量来增强你的施法能力。当你施放一个法术时，你可以使用一个奖励动作来利用这个联系。这样做意味着你不需要消耗法术槽来施放法术，能量来自外部力量。",
	"The more you draw on the link, the harder it is to maintain. Each spell you cast in this manner decreases the duration of this spell's casting by 10 minutes per level of the spell you cast using the link.

The target must have a physical body; the spell fails if the target is normally noncorporeal.": "当施放在一具死亡或不死之身上时，此法术会使那个生物恢复到生前健康无伤时的外貌。目标必须有一个实体身体；如果目标通常是无实体的，则法术失败。",

The target looks, smells, and sounds (if it can speak) as it did in life.": "如果目标是一只不死生物，它也会恢复到它生前的样子，即使它是因疾病、严重伤势或数个世纪前死亡。目标的外表、气味和声音（如果它能说话）都会恢复到生前的状态。",
	"Friends and family can tell something is wrong only with a successful Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check against your spell save DC, and only if they have reason to be suspicious.

	"This spell doesn't confer the ability to speak on undead that normally can't speak. The creature eats, drinks, and breathes as a living creature does; it can mimic sleep, but it has no more need for it than it had before.": "这个法术并不能让那些通常不能说话的不死生物获得说话的能力。这种生物会像活着的生物一样进食、饮水和呼吸；它可以模仿睡眠，但它对睡眠的需求并不比以前更多。",
	"The effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your caster level. You can use an action to end the spell early. Any amount of radiant or necrotic damage dealt to the creature, or any effect that reduces its Constitution, also ends the spell.": "效果持续时间为你的施法者等级的小时数。你可以使用一个动作来提前结束法术。对生物造成的任何量的辐射或死灵伤害，或任何降低其体质的效果，也会结束这个法术。",
	"If this spell is cast on an undead creature that isn't your ally or under your control, it makes a Charisma saving throw to resist the effect.": "如果这个法术施放在一个不是你盟友或在你控制之下的不死生物身上，它需要进行一次魅力豁免检定来抵抗该效果。",
	"You touch the ashes, embers, or soot left behind by a fire and receive a vision of one significant event that occurred in the area while the fire was burning. For example, if you were to touch the cold embers of a campfire, you might witness a snippet of a conversation that occurred around the fire. Similarly, touching the ashes of a burned letter might grant you a vision of the person who destroyed the letter or the contents of the letter. You have no control over what information the spell reveals, but your vision usually is tied to the most meaningful event related to the fire. The GM determines the details of what is revealed.": "当你触摸火灾留下的灰烬、余烬或煤灰时，你会得到一个与火灾发生时区域内的一个重要事件有关的幻象。例如，如果你触摸一个篝火的冷余烬，你可能会看到篝火周围发生的一段对话。同样地，触摸一封烧焦的信件的灰烬可能会让你看到摧毁这封信件的人或信件的内容。你无法控制这个法术揭示的信息，但你的幻象通常与与火灾相关的最有意义的事件有关。GM决定揭示的细节。",
	"You alter the appearance of a creature you touch, giving it a more simian form. While this spell is in effect, the subject gains a climbing speed equal to its normal walking speed, and gains advantage on Strength ({@skill Athletics}) checks made when jumping or climbing. When up in a tree's branches (or in a similar area, at the GM's discretion) the target can move up to its climbing speed as a bonus action, using brachiation to reach a nearby tree if the branches are close enough together. This bonus action can be taken only if the subject has at least two hands free, or one hand free if the subject is barefoot.": "你改变了你触摸的生物的外观，使其更像猿类。在这个法术生效期间，目标获得一个等于其正常行走速度的攀爬速度，并且在进行跳跃或攀爬时获得优势，这些检定是关于力量({@skill Athletics})的。当在树枝上（或类似区域，由GM决定）时，目标可以作为一个奖励动作移动到其攀爬速度，使用摆臂来到达附近的树，如果树枝足够接近的话。只有在目标至少有两只手空闲时，或者如果目标赤脚时有一只手空闲时，才能进行这个奖励动作。",

	"As an action, you can emit a blast of light 5 feet wide and 50 feet long. All creatures in its path take {@damage 6d6} fire damage and are {@condition blinded} for {@dice 1d4} rounds. A successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the blindness. Each time you use this feature of the spell, its duration is reduced by 1 hour. When you expend the last hour of the duration, the spell ends at the start of your next turn.": "作为一个动作，你可以发射一道宽5英尺、长50英尺的光束。路径上的所有生物会受到{@damage 6d6}火焰伤害，并在接下来的{@dice 1d4} 回合内变为{@condition blinded}。成功的敏捷豁免才能减半伤害并消除致盲效果。每次你使用这个法术特性，它的持续时间会减少1小时。当你消耗完最后一个小时的持续时间时，法术会在你的下一个回合开始时结束。",
	"You take on the aspect of a ram, including some physical attributes. Your body hair grows thick and woolly, and a curling pair of horns sprouts from your head.

	"For the duration of the spell, the area is difficult terrain. The spears (AC 14) can be damaged; they are immune to piercing damage and have resistance to bludgeoning and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. If a 5-foot square section of spears takes 15 damage, that's enough to free a {@condition restrained} creature or clear the section of spears.": "在咒语持续期间，该区域成为艰难地形。长矛（AC 14）可以被破坏；它们免疫刺穿伤害，并对来自非魔法攻击的钝击和斩击伤害具有抗性。如果一个5英尺的正方形长矛区域受到15点伤害，这足以释放一个{@condition restrained}生物或清除该长矛区域。",

If you make a successful melee attack against such a creature before the spell ends, in addition to the usual effect of that attack, the target takes {@damage 2d4} necrotic damage and one or more of the victim's available spell slots are transferred to you, to be used as your own. Roll a {@dice d6}; the result equals the total levels of the slots transferred. Spell slots of the highest possible level are transferred before lower-level slots.": "这个法术只对那些提前准备法术且至少有一个未使用的6级或更低级法术位的奥术或神圣施法者生效。如果在法术结束前你成功进行近战攻击该生物，除了该攻击的通常效果外，目标还会受到{@damage 2d4}点死灵伤害，并且受害者的一个或多个可用法术位会被转移给你，供你使用。投掷一个{@dice d6}；结果等于转移的法术位总等级。高等级法术位会先被转移，然后才是低等级法术位。",
	"For example, if you roll a 5 and the target has at least one 5th-level spell slot available, that slot transfers to you. If the target's highest available spell slot is 3rd level, then you might receive a 3rd-level slot and a 2nd-level slot, or a 3rd-level slot and two 1st-level slots if no 2nd-level slot is available.": "例如，如果你掷出了一个5，而目标至少有一个5级法术位可用，那么该法术位会转移到你身上。如果目标最高可用的法术位是3级，那么你可能会收到一个3级法术位和一个2级法术位，或者一个3级法术位和两个1级法术位（如果没有2级法术位可用的话）。",
	"If the target has no available spell slots of an appropriate level—for example, if you roll a 2 and the target has expended all of its 1st- and 2nd-level spell slots—then this spell has no effect, including causing no necrotic damage. If a stolen spell slot is of a higher level than you're able to use, treat it as of the highest level you can use.": "如果目标没有可用的适当等级的法术位——例如，如果你掷出的是2，而目标已经用尽了所有的1级和2级法术位——那么这个法术没有任何效果，包括不造成死灵伤害。如果被偷取的法术位比你能够使用的等级高，将其视为你能够使用的最高等级。",

The target takes {@damage 4d6} psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.": "这个法术的效果与{@spell maze}相同，但目标在迷宫中每当开始自己的回合时，必须进行一次敏捷豁免。在豁免失败时，目标会受到{@damage 4d6}点心灵伤害；在豁免成功时，伤害减半。",

	"You take on the physical characteristics of the terrain around you. In a forest, grass and tiny mushrooms sprout in your hair, moss beards your chin, and your flesh takes on the mottled hue of leaf green and bark brown.

This effect provides a +2 bonus to {@skill Stealth} checks in the appropriate terrain.": "你会呈现出周围地形的物理特征。在森林中，你的头发上会长出草和小蘑菇，苔藓会覆盖你的下巴，你的皮肤会呈现出叶绿和树皮褐的斑驳色彩。在北极草原中，灰色地衣和北部草地的各种色调会掩盖你的存在。这个效果会为适当地形的{@skill Stealth}检定提供+2的奖励。",

In addition, Charisma checks against the target are made with disadvantage for the spell's duration.": "你赋予你的触碰力量，使生物变得冷漠、铁石心肠和无情。在施放此法术时触碰的生物必须进行一次感知豁免检定；生物可以选择放弃这次豁免检定，除非它目前处于{@condition charmed}状态。若豁免检定成功，此法术失败。若豁免检定失败，目标在持续时间内免疫于被{@condition charmed}；若它目前处于{@condition charmed}状态，则该效果结束。此外，在法术持续时间内对目标进行的魅力检定将以劣势进行。",

On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks to avoid your notice and is {@condition frightened} of you while you are within its line of sight. While you are within 1 mile of the target, you have advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) checks to track the target, and the target can't take a long rest, terrified that you are just around the corner. The target can repeat the saving throw once every 10 minutes, ending the spell on a success.": "你在目标心中灌输了一种无法抗拒的不安和恐惧感。目标必须进行一次感知豁免投骰。如果投骰失败，目标在你视线范围内时，对于避开你注意的敏捷({@skill Stealth})检定会受到劣势，并且会对你感到{@condition frightened}。当你距离目标1英里以内时，你在感知({@skill Survival})检定中对目标的追踪具有优势，而目标无法进行长休，因为害怕你就在附近。目标可以每10分钟重复进行一次豁免投骰，成功投骰则结束法术效果。",

	"The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell's duration, the weapon's ammunition—or the weapon itself, if it's a thrown weapon—seeks its target's vital organs. Make the attack roll as normal. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra {@damage 6d6} damage of the same type dealt by the weapon, or half as much damage on a miss, as it streaks unerringly toward its target.

	"You create a number of clay pigeons equal to {@dice 1d4} + your spellcasting modifier (minimum of one) that swirl around you. When you are the target of a ranged weapon attack or a ranged spell attack and before the attack roll is made, you can use your reaction to shout \"Pull!\" When you do, one clay pigeon maneuvers to block the incoming attack. If the attack roll is less than 10 + your proficiency bonus, the attack misses. Otherwise, make a check with your spellcasting ability modifier and compare it to the attack roll.

The target takes additional fire damage at the start of each of your next three turns, starting with {@dice 4d6}, then {@dice 2d6}, and then {@dice 1d6}.

The squirrels form into a swarm that uses the statistics of a {@creature swarm of poisonous snakes}, except it has a climbing speed of 30 feet rather than a swimming speed. The legion of squirrels is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the legion, which has its own turns. The legion of squirrels obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the legion, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

	"This spell makes even the most barefaced untruth seem plausible: you gain advantage on Charisma ({@skill Deception}) checks to convince another creature of the truth of whatever you're saying. On a failed check, the creature knows that you tried to manipulate it with magic. If you successfully lie to a creature that has a friendly attitude toward you, it must make a Charisma saving throw.

	"You create a glowing arrow of necrotic magic and command it to strike a creature you can see within range. The arrow can have one of two effects; you choose which at the moment of casting.

	"You target a piece of metal equipment or a metal construct. If the target is a creature wearing metal armor or is a construct, it makes a Wisdom saving throw to negate the effect. On a failed save, the spell causes metal to cling to metal, making it impossible to move pieces against each other. This effectively paralyzes a creature that is made of metal or that is wearing metal armor with moving pieces; for example, scale mail would lock up because the scales must slide across each other, but a breastplate would be unaffected. Limited movement might still be possible, depending on how extensive the armor is, and speech is usually not affected.": "你瞄准了一件金属装备或金属构造物。如果目标是一名穿着金属盔甲或是一名构造物的生物，它需要进行一次感知豁免才能抵消这个效果。如果豁免失败，这个法术会让金属附着在金属上，使得移动的部件无法相互移动。这会有效地让由金属制成的生物或穿着金属盔甲的生物无法移动；例如，鳞甲会因为鳞片需要相互滑动而被锁住，但胸甲则不受影响。根据盔甲的复杂程度，可能仍然可以进行有限的移动，而言语通常不受影响。",
	"Metal constructs, as well as creatures wearing metal armor (according to DM discretion) are {@condition paralyzed}.

	"You touch a trail no more than 1 mile in length, reconfiguring it to give it switchbacks and curves that make the trail loop back on itself.

A creature on the trail must succeed on a Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check to notice that the trail is leading it in a closed loop.": "你触摸一条不超过1英里长的小径，重新设计它，增加蜿蜒曲折的弯道，使小径回旋。在持续时间内，小径在配置和周围环境上进行微妙的变化，给人一种沿着连续路径不断前进的印象。在小径上的生物必须成功进行一次感知（智力）检定，才能注意到小径正在引导它走向一个封闭循环。",

From that point on, the mire acts as {@hazard quicksand}, but the DC for Strength checks to escape from the quicksand is equal to your spell save DC. A creature outside the mire trying to pull another creature free receives a +5 bonus on its Strength check.": "当你施放这个法术时，你创造一个直径10英尺的流沙坑、黏土或类似危险的自然灾害，适合于该地区。当法术被施放时处于该区域内的生物，或进入受影响区域的生物，必须进行一次成功的力量豁免才能避免陷入到腰部并被{@condition restrained}。从那时起，这个泥潭就像{@hazard quicksand}一样，但要从流沙中逃脱的力量豁免 DC 等于你的法术豁免 DC。在泥潭外尝试解救另一个生物的生物在其力量豁免检定上获得+5的加值。",

	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 1st. You can direct the rays at one target or several.": "当你使用2级或更高级别的法术位施放这个法术时，你会为每个高于1级的法术位等级创建一个额外的射线。你可以将这些射线指向一个目标或多个目标。",
	"This spell enables you to create a copy of a one-page written work by placing a blank piece of paper or parchment near the work that you are copying. All the writing, illustrations, and other elements in the original are reproduced in the new document, in your handwriting or drawing style. The new medium must be large enough to accommodate the original source. Any magical properties of the original aren't reproduced, so you can't use scribe to make copies of spell scrolls or magic books.": "这个法术让你能够通过将一张空白纸张或羊皮纸放在你要复制的作品旁边来创建一份副本。原作品中的所有文字、插图和其他元素都会以你的书写或绘画风格复制到新文件中。新媒介必须足够大以容纳原始来源。原作品的任何魔法属性都不会被复制，因此你不能使用抄写来复制咒语卷轴或魔法书籍。",
	"This spell enables a willing creature you touch to see through any obstructions as if they were transparent. For the duration, the target can see into and through opaque objects, creatures, spells, and effects that obstruct line of sight to a range of 30 feet. Inside that distance, the creature can choose what it perceives as opaque and what it perceives as transparent as freely and as naturally as it can shift its focus from nearby to distant objects.": "这个法术让你触摸的一名愿意的生物能够透过任何障碍物看到，就像它们是透明的一样。在持续时间内，目标可以看穿不透明的物体、生物、法术和阻挡视线的效果，范围为30英尺。在这个距离内，生物可以自由选择将什么视为不透明，将什么视为透明，就像将注意力从附近转移到远处物体一样自如和自然。",
	"Although the creature can see any target within 30 feet of itself, all other requirements must still be satisfied before casting a spell or making an attack against that target. For example, the creature can see an enemy that has total cover but can't shoot that enemy with an arrow because the cover physically prevents it. That enemy could be targeted by a {@spell geas} spell, however, because geas needs only a visible target.": "尽管生物可以看到自己30英尺内的任何目标，但在对该目标施放法术或进行攻击之前，仍必须满足所有其他要求。例如，生物可以看到一个有全掩体的敌人，但无法用箭射击该敌人，因为掩体物理上阻止了射击。然而，该敌人可以成为{@spell geas}法术的目标，因为《神秘咒》只需要一个可见目标。",
	"Your touch inflicts a virulent, flesh-eating disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the creature's Dexterity score is reduced by {@dice 1d4}, and it is afflicted with the {@i seeping death} disease for the duration.": "你的接触会传播一种剧毒的、吞噬肉体的疾病。对你能够触及的生物进行一次近战法术攻击。命中后，该生物的敏捷分数减少 {@dice 1d4}，并且在持续时间内患上 {@i seeping death} 疾病。",

	"{@b Seeping Death}. The creature's flesh is slowly liquefied by a lingering necrotic pestilence. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its Dexterity score is reduced by {@dice 1d4}. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's Dexterity to 0, the creature dies.": "{@b Seeping Death}。生物的肉体被一种持续的死灵瘟疫慢慢液化。每次长休结束时，患病生物必须成功进行一次体质豁免才能，否则其敏捷分数将减少{@dice 1d4}。减少效果持续到疾病被治愈后目标完成一次长休。如果疾病将生物的敏捷减少到0，生物将死亡。",
	"You and up to five of your allies within range contribute part of your life force to create a pool that can be used for healing. Each target takes 5 necrotic damage (which can't be reduced but can be healed normally), and those donated hit points are channeled into a reservoir of life essence. As an action, any creature who contributed to the pool of hit points can heal another creature by touching it and drawing hit points from the pool into the injured creature. The injured creature heals a number of hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and the hit points in the pool decrease by the same amount. This process can be repeated until the pool is exhausted or the spell's duration expires.": "你和范围内最多五个盟友共同贡献生命力的一部分，创造一个可以用于治疗的池塘。每个目标受到5点死灵伤害（无法减少，但可以正常治愈），那些捐赠的生命值被引导到生命精华的储备中。作为一个动作，任何贡献到生命值池的生物可以通过触摸另一个生物，并从池中吸取生命值来治愈受伤的生物。受伤的生物恢复的生命值等同于你的法术施法能力调整值，池中的生命值减少相同数量。这个过程可以重复，直到池耗尽或法术持续时间结束。",
	"Arcs of electricity dance over your body for the duration, granting you resistance to lightning damage. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.": "电弧在你的身体上跳跃，持续一段时间，使你对闪电伤害具有抗性。你可以通过使用一个动作来提前结束这个法术。",
	"In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, arcs of electricity strike your attacker, who takes {@damage 2d8} lightning damage.": "此外，每当一个在你5英尺范围内的生物用近战攻击命中你时，电弧会击中你的攻击者，造成{@damage 2d8} 闪电伤害。",
	"You call up a black veil of necrotic energy that devours the living. You draw on the life energy of all living creatures within 30 feet of you that you can see. When you cast the spell, every living creature within 30 feet of you that you can see takes 1 necrotic damage, and all those hit points transfer to you as temporary hit points. The damage and the temporary hit points increase to 2 per creature at the start of your second turn concentrating on the spell, 3 per creature at the start of your third turn, and so on. All living creatures you can see within 30 feet of you at the start of each of your turns are affected. A creature can avoid the effect by moving more than 30 feet away from you or by getting out of your line of sight, but it becomes susceptible again if the necessary conditions are met. The temporary hit points last until the spell ends.": "你召唤出一层黑色的死灵能量，吞噬着生命。你汲取你能看到的30英尺范围内所有生物的生命能量。施放此法术时，你能看到的30英尺范围内的每个生物都会受到1点死灵伤害，并且这些生命值会转移给你，作为临时生命值。在你专注于该法术的第二个回合开始时，伤害和临时生命值会增加到每个生物2点，第三个回合开始时增加到每个生物3点，依此类推。在你的每个回合开始时，你能看到的30英尺范围内的所有生物都会受到影响。生物可以通过移动超过30英尺远离你或躲开你的视线来避免影响，但如果满足必要条件，它们会再次受到影响。临时生命值持续到法术结束。",
	"With a few perfectly timed steps, you interpose a foe between you and danger. You cast this spell when an enemy makes a ranged attack or a ranged spell attack against you but before the attack is resolved. At least one other foe must be within 10 feet of you when you cast this spell. As part of casting the spell, you can move up to 15 feet to a place where an enemy lies between you and the attacker. If no such location is available, the spell has no effect. You must be able to move (not {@condition restrained} or {@condition grappled} or prevented from moving for any other reason), and this move does not provoke {@action opportunity attack||opportunity attacks}. After you move, the ranged attack is resolved with the intervening foe as the target instead of you.": "在几个完美的时刻，你将一个敌人置于你和危险之间。当敌人对你进行远程攻击或远程法术攻击时，但在攻击解决之前，你施放这个法术。在你施放这个法术时，至少还有另一个敌人必须在你的10英尺内。作为施放法术的一部分，你可以移动多达15英尺，到一个敌人位于你和攻击者之间的位置。如果没有这样的位置可用，法术不会生效。你必须能够移动（不是{@condition restrained}或{@condition grappled}或因其他原因而无法移动），这次移动不会引发{@action opportunity attack||opportunity attacks}。移动后，远程攻击将以介入的敌人作为目标，而不是你。",

	"By casting this spell, you imbue a piece of ammunition to have greater effect on a specific target. To this end, you need something directly associated with the creature for which the arrow is intended—a drop of its blood, a strand of its hair, an item of clothing it recently wore, or something similar—which is consumed in the casting of the spell. For the next 24 hours, if the ammunition is used to make a ranged attack against the specific target and it hits, it deals an extra {@damage 6d10} radiant damage to the target and stuns it for 1 round. If the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw, it takes half as much radiant damage and is not {@condition stunned}. If the attack is a critical hit, the creature has disadvantage on its saving throw.": "通过施放这个法术，你赋予一枚弹药对特定目标产生更强效果的能力。为此，你需要与箭矢目标生物直接相关的东西——比如一滴它的血、一缕它的头发、它最近穿过的衣物，或类似的东西——这些物品在施法时被消耗。在接下来的24小时内，如果这枚弹药被用来对特定目标进行远程攻击并命中，它会额外造成{@damage 6d10}辐射伤害并使目标晕眩1轮。如果目标成功通过体质豁免，它会受到一半的辐射伤害并不会{@condition stunned}。如果攻击是暴击，目标在豁免检定时有劣势。",
	"Choose a beast that you can see within range. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. The beast must make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, you remove the shackles of domestication from the creature's mind, causing it to entirely forget being broken or trained. Mounts refuse to be ridden, and other animals forget any tricks learned and obedience taught. Other memories are not affected, so creatures might remain drawn to those who have treated them kindly and aggressive toward those who have harmed them. The animal can be domesticated again, but the trainer must start from scratch.": "选择你能看到的范围内的一只野兽。如果这只野兽的智力为4或更高，那么法术失败。这只野兽必须进行一次感知豁免；如果豁免失败，你将解除这个生物心灵上的驯化枷锁，使其完全忘记被驯服或训练过的事实。坐骑拒绝被骑乘，其他动物忘记任何学会的技巧和教导的服从。其他记忆不受影响，因此生物可能仍然对那些善待它们的人感到亲近，对那些伤害它们的人感到敌意。这只动物可以再次被驯化，但训练者必须从头开始。",
	"This spell is only partly effective against animal companions, familiars, and paladin mounts. Although the spell removes any tricks such creatures know, the bond between creature and master is otherwise unaffected.": "这个法术对动物伙伴、使者和圣骑士坐骑只有部分效果。尽管法术会移除这些生物知道的任何技能，但生物与主人之间的联系不受影响。",
	"Intoning a lulling drone, you convince creatures not to do you harm. At the beginning of its turn, any creature that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is {@condition charmed}. A creature {@condition charmed} by this spell can still act aggressively toward your allies.

	"By touching a creature, you gain one sense, movement mode and speed, feat, language, immunity, or other nonmagical ability of the target for the duration of the spell. The target also retains the use of the borrowed ability. An unwilling target prevents the effect with a successful Constitution saving throw. The target can be a living creature or one that has been dead no longer than 1 minute; a corpse automatically fails the saving throw. You can possess only one borrowed ability at a time.": "通过触摸一个生物，你在咒语持续时间内获得目标的一个感官、移动方式和速度、特技、语言、免疫力或其他非魔法能力。目标也保留被借用能力的使用权。不愿意的目标可以通过成功的体质豁免才能阻止这一效果。目标可以是一个活生物或者死亡不超过1分钟的生物；尸体会自动失败豁免。你一次只能拥有一个借用的能力。",

They ignore difficult terrain and are immune to damage.": "当目标以这种方式被拖动时，它会再被拖动60英尺，并在你的每个回合开始时受到另外{@damage 3d6}的钝击伤害。小马们会在施法持续时间内继续朝选定方向奔跑。一旦方向被选择，你就无法改变它，但小马们会绕过无法通过的障碍物。它们会忽略难以行走的地形，并且免疫伤害。",

You gain advantage on any attack against a target that has failed its saving throw against this spell.": "一声深沉、悠长的钟声似乎从远处的上方响起，审判你的敌人并预示着他们即将遭受的厄运。你能看到的范围内最多八个生物必须进行魅力豁免才能。每当一名未通过此豁免检定的目标在法术结束前进行攻击检定或豁免检定时，该目标必须投掷一个{@dice d4}，并从攻击检定或豁免检定的结果中减去这个值。对于任何一名未通过此法术的豁免检定的目标，你对其进行的任何攻击都会获得优势。",
	"This spell has no effect on a target that has an Intelligence score lower than 3.": "这个法术对智力分数低于3的目标没有任何效果。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can affect one additional target for each slot level above 6th.": "当你使用7级或更高级别的法术位施放这个法术时，你可以影响每个高于6级的法术位级别多一个目标。",
	"{@i Tongue of sand} is similar in many ways to {@spell magic mouth}. When you cast it, you implant a message in a quantity of sand. The sand must fill a space no smaller than 4 square feet and at least 2 inches deep. The message can be up to 25 words. You also decide the conditions that trigger the speaking of the message. When the message is triggered, a mouth forms in the sand and delivers the message in a raspy, whispered voice that can be heard by creatures within 10 feet of the sand.": "{@i Tongue of sand} 在许多方面与{@spell magic mouth} 相似。当你施放它时，你会将一条信息植入一定数量的沙子中。沙子必须填满至少4平方英尺且至少2英寸深的空间。信息最多可以有25个字。你还要决定触发信息播放的条件。当信息被触发时，沙子中会形成一个嘴，并以沙哑的低语声传达信息，可以被沙子周围10英尺范围内的生物听到。",
	"Additionally, {@i tongue of sand} has the ability to interact in a simple, brief manner with creatures who hear its message. For up to 10 minutes after the message is triggered, questions addressed to the sand will be answered as you would answer them. Each answer can be no more than ten words long, and the spell ends after a second question is answered.": "此外，{@i tongue of sand} 有能力以简洁的方式与听到它信息的生物互动。在信息被触发后的最多10分钟内，对沙子提出的问题将被回答，就像你会回答它们一样。每个答案不能超过十个字，并且在回答第二个问题后法术结束。",
	"You make a choking motion while pointing at a target, which must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become unable to communicate verbally. The target's speech becomes garbled, and it has disadvantage on Charisma checks that require speech. The creature can cast a spell that has a verbal component only by making a successful Constitution check against your spell save DC.": "你做出一个模拟勒颈的动作，同时指向一个目标，目标必须进行一次成功的感知豁免才能继续口头交流。目标的言语变得含糊不清，对于需要言语的魅力检定有劣势。该生物只有通过对抗你的法术豁免 DC 的体质检定才能施放需要口头组件的法术。",
	"On a failed check, the creature's action is used but the spell slot isn't expended.": "在失败的检定中，生物的动作被使用，但法术位不会消耗。",
	"Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 2d6} necrotic damage and, if it is not an undead creature, it is {@condition paralyzed} until the end of its next turn. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.": "对你能够接触到的生物进行一次近战法术攻击。命中后，目标受到{@damage 2d6}点死灵伤害，并且如果它不是不死生物，它将在其下一个回合结束前被{@condition paralyzed}。直到法术结束，你可以在每个回合的行动中再次进行攻击。",
	"When you cast this spell and as a bonus action on each of your turns until the spell ends, you can imbue a piece of ammunition you fire from a ranged weapon with a tiny, {@condition invisible} beacon. If a ranged attack roll with an imbued piece of ammunition hits a target, the beacon is transferred to the target. The weapon that fired the ammunition is attuned to the beacon and becomes warm to the touch when it points in the direction of the target as long as the target is on the same plane of existence as you. You can have only one tracer target at a time. If you put a tracer on a different target, the effect on the previous target ends.": "当你施放这个法术并在每个回合的奖励动作中，直到法术结束时，你可以用一个微小的，{@condition invisible}的信标灌注你从远程武器射出的弹药。如果使用被灌注的弹药进行的远程攻击命中目标，信标会转移到目标身上。射出弹药的武器会与信标相连，当指向目标的方向时会变得温暖，只要目标和你在同一个存在平面上。你一次只能有一个追踪目标。如果你将追踪器放在另一个目标上，之前目标上的效果就会结束。",
	"A creature must succeed on an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check against your spell save DC to notice the magical beacon.": "生物必须通过一个智力检定（{@skill Arcana}）与你的法术豁免 DC 对抗，才能察觉到这个魔法信标。",
	"You touch a plant, and it regains {@dice 1d4} hit points. Alternatively, you can cure it of one disease or remove pests from it. Once you cast this spell on a plant or plant creature, you can't cast it on that target again for 24 hours. This spell can be used only on plants and plant creatures.": "你触摸一株植物，它恢复{@dice 1d4}点生命值。或者，你可以治愈它身上的一种疾病或清除害虫。一旦你对一株植物或植物生物施放了这个法术，你在接下来的24小时内不能再次对同一目标使用该法术。这个法术只能用于植物和植物生物身上。",
	"One willing creature you touch gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed. This climbing speed functions only while the creature is in contact with a living plant or fungus that's growing from the ground. The creature can cling to an appropriate surface with just one hand or with just its feet, leaving its hands free to wield weapons or cast spells. The plant doesn't give under the creature's weight, so the creature can walk on the tiniest of tree branches, stand on a leaf, or run across the waving top of a field of wheat without bending a stalk or touching the ground.": "你触摸的一名愿意生物获得一个等同于其行走速度的攀爬速度。这种攀爬速度仅在生物与生长在地面上的植物或真菌接触时有效。生物可以只用一只手或只用脚紧贴适当的表面，让双手空出来持武器或施法。植物不会因为生物的重量而弯曲，因此生物可以在最细小的树枝上行走，站在叶子上，或者在一片麦田的摇曳顶部奔跑，而不会弯曲茎秆或接触地面。",
	"You touch a tree and ask one question about anything that might have happened in its immediate vicinity (such as \"Who passed by here?\"). You get a mental sensation of the response, which lasts for the duration of the spell. Trees do not have a humanoid's sense of time, so the tree might speak about something that happened last night or a hundred years ago. The sensation you receive might include sight, hearing, vibration, or smell, all from the tree's perspective. Trees are particularly attentive to anything that might harm the forest and always report such activities when questioned.": "你触摸一棵树，并询问关于其周围可能发生的任何事情的一个问题（比如“谁曾经经过这里？”）。你会在法术持续时间内获得对答案的心灵感应。树木没有人类的时间感知，所以树可能会谈论发生在昨晚或一百年前的事情。你收到的感应可能包括从树木的视角看到的景象、听到的声音、感受到的震动或气味。树木特别关注可能危害森林的任何事情，并且总是在被询问时报告这类活动。",
	"If you cast this spell on a tree that contains a creature that can merge with trees, such as a dryad, you can freely communicate with the merged creature for the duration of the spell.": "如果你对一棵树施放这个法术，而这棵树里有一个可以与树融合的生物，比如树精，你可以在法术持续期间自由地与融合的生物交流。",
	"By making a scooping gesture, you cause the ground to slowly sink in an area 5 feet wide and 60 feet long, originating from a point within range. When the casting is finished, a 5-foot-deep trench is the result.": "通过做一个舀的手势，你让地面在一个5英尺宽、60英尺长的区域内缓慢下沉，起始点在施法范围内。施法完成后，结果是一个深5英尺的壕沟。",
	"The spell works only on flat, open ground (not on stone or paved surfaces) that is not occupied by creatures or objects.": "这个法术只能在平坦、开阔的地面上施展（不能在石头或铺设的表面上），且该地面上不能有生物或物体。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can increase the width of the trench by 5 feet or the length by 30 feet for each slot level above 2nd. You can make a different choice (width or length) for each slot level above 2nd.": "当你使用3级或更高级别的法术位施放这个法术时，你可以使壕沟的宽度增加5英尺，或者长度增加30英尺，每个高于2级的位级。你可以在每个高于2级的位级上做出不同的选择（宽度或长度）。",
	"You pose a question that can be answered by one word, directed at a creature that can hear you. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to answer your question truthfully. When the answer is given, the target knows that you used magic to compel it.": "你向一个能听到你的生物提出一个可以用一个词回答的问题。目标必须进行一次成功的感知豁免才能被迫诚实地回答你的问题。当答案被给出时，目标会知道你使用了魔法来迫使它回答。",
	"A golden radiance spreads out from you, providing bright light up to 30 feet away, and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Any creatures or objects in the area of bright light that are {@condition invisible} become visible while they are within 30 feet of you. Likewise, any magical disguises or illusions within 30 feet of you become feeble and transparent, their illusory nature obvious. These magical effects return to full potency if they move more than 30 feet away from you, or vice versa.": "一道金色光辉从你身上散发出来，照亮30英尺范围内的明亮光线，并在额外30英尺范围内提供昏暗光线。在明亮光线区域内的任何生物或物体，当它们在你的30英尺范围内时，{@condition invisible}变得可见。同样，任何在你30英尺范围内的魔法伪装或幻象变得虚弱透明，它们的幻术本质显而易见。如果它们离你超过30英尺，或者相反，这些魔法效果会恢复到完全效力。",
	"When a creature that has taken a different form—through spells such as {@spell polymorph} or {@spell shapechange}, or from inborn abilities, such as a druid's {@classFeature wild shape|Druid||2} feature—enters the bright light, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be forced to return to its original form. Likewise, a creature attempting to change shape within the bright light must succeed on a Constitution saving throw in order to do so.": "当一个生物通过诸如{@spell polymorph}或{@spell shapechange}这样的法术，或者通过天生能力（比如德鲁伊的{@classFeature wild shape|Druid||2}特性）变换形态后，进入明亮光线时，必须进行一次体质豁免检定，否则将被迫恢复原始形态。同样，一个生物在明亮光线中尝试改变形态时，必须进行一次体质豁免检定才能成功。",
	"You tweak a strand of a creature's fate as it attempts an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. Roll a {@dice d20} and subtract 10 to produce a number from 10 to–9. Add that number to the creature's roll. This adjustment can turn a failure into a success or vice versa, or it might not change the outcome at all.": "当一只生物尝试进行攻击骰、豁免骰或技能检定时，你可以微调其命运之线。掷出一个{@dice d20}，然后减去10，得到一个-9到10之间的数字。将该数字加到生物的骰值上。这个调整可以将失败变为成功，反之亦然，或者可能根本不改变结果。",
	"You extend a hand and point a finger at a creature within range. Your magic grants the target enhanced awareness of attacks directed at it. The next attack roll against the creature before the spell ends is made with disadvantage.": "你伸出一只手，指向范围内的一个生物。你的魔法让目标对针对它的攻击有增强的意识。在法术结束之前对该生物的下一次攻击骰投掷将具有劣势。",
	"Until the spell ends, undead creatures within range have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead. If an undead creature within this area has the Turning Defiance trait, that creature can roll a {@dice d4} when it makes a saving throw against an effect that turns undead and add the number rolled to the saving throw.": "在咒语持续期间，范围内的不死生物在对抗使其转化的效果时获得优势。如果在此区域内的不死生物具有（Turning Defiance）特性，该生物可以在对抗使其转化的效果的豁免投掷时投掷一个{@dice d4}，并将投掷的数字加到豁免投掷中。",
	"You cause a stone statue that you can see within 60 feet of you to animate as your ally. The statue has the statistics of a {@creature stone golem}. It takes a turn immediately after your turn. As a bonus action on your turn, you can order the golem to move and attack, provided you're within 60 feet of it. Without orders from you, the statue does nothing.": "你可以让你看到的距离60英尺内的石像变成你的盟友。这个石像拥有{@creature stone golem}的属性。它会在你的回合之后立即行动。在你的回合中，你可以用一个奖励动作命令这个魔像移动和攻击，前提是你距离它在60英尺内。如果没有你的命令，这个石像将不会做任何事情。",
	"Whenever the statue has 75 hit points or fewer at the start of your turn or it is more than 60 feet from you at the start of your turn, you must make a successful DC 16 spellcasting check or the statue goes berserk. On each of its turns, the berserk statue attacks you or one of your allies. If no creature is near enough to be attacked, the statue dashes toward the nearest one instead. Once the statue goes berserk, it remains berserk until it's destroyed.": "每当雕像在你的回合开始时拥有75点生命值或更少，或者在你的回合开始时距离你超过60英尺时，你必须进行一次成功的DC 16施法检定，否则雕像会变得狂暴。在它的每个回合，狂暴的雕像会攻击你或你的盟友之一。如果没有足够接近的生物可以被攻击，雕像会向最近的生物冲刺。一旦雕像变得狂暴，它会保持狂暴状态直到被摧毁。",
	"When the spell ends, the animated statue reverts to a normal, mundane statue.": "当法术结束时，活化雕像会恢复成一座普通的、平凡的雕像。",
	"By uttering a swift curse (\"Unluck on that!\"), you bring misfortune to the target's attempt; the affected creature has disadvantage on the roll.": "通过快速念咒（\"（Unluck on that!）\"）你给目标的尝试带来了厄运；受影响的生物在投掷骰子时有劣势。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the range of the spell increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.": "当你使用2级或更高级别的法术位施放这个法术时，法术的射程每超过1级的位数增加5英尺。",
	"When you cast this spell, your face momentarily becomes that of a demon lord, frightful enough to drive enemies mad. Every foe that's within 30 feet of you and that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature claws savagely at its eyes, dealing piercing damage to itself equal to {@dice 1d6} + the creature's Strength modifier. The creature is also {@condition stunned} until the end of its next turn and {@condition blinded} for {@dice 1d4} rounds. A creature that rolls maximum damage against itself (a 6 on the {@dice d6}) is {@condition blinded} permanently.": "当你施放这个法术时，你的脸瞬间变成了一个恶魔领主的模样，足以让敌人发狂。每个在你30英尺范围内且能看到你的敌人必须进行一次感知豁免。在豁免失败时，生物会疯狂地抓自己的眼睛，对自己造成等于{@dice 1d6} + 该生物力量调整值的穿刺伤害。该生物在接下来的回合结束前会被{@condition stunned}，并且在{@dice 1d4} 回合内会被{@condition blinded}。如果生物对自己造成最大伤害（在{@dice d6}上投掷到6），它将永久性地被{@condition blinded}。",
	"You infuse yourself, and up to four creatures you touch, with necromantic energy, taking on aspects of the undead. The targets gain immunity to poison damage and the {@condition poisoned} condition for the duration of the spell, and take on appearances similar to undead versions of themselves.": "你将自己和最多四个触摸到的生物注入死灵能量，拥有亡灵的特征。在法术持续期间，目标获得对毒性伤害和{@condition poisoned}状态的免疫，并呈现出类似于他们的亡灵版本的外表。",
	"Undead that encounter a creature under the effect of this spell must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the undead mistakes the target for another undead creature. Typically this means the undead will ignore the target, especially if it is a less intelligent one such as a skeleton or a zombie, unless it is commanded otherwise. The response of more intelligent undead might depend on the conditions under which the encounter occurs, but if the target's presence would not be unusual, they too might likely ignore the target unless it acts suspiciously.": "遇到受此法术影响的生物的不死生物必须对抗你的法术豁免 DC 进行一次智力豁免。如果未通过豁免，不死生物会误认目标为另一个不死生物。通常情况下，这意味着不死生物会忽视目标，尤其是对于智力较低的不死生物，如骷髅或僵尸，除非另有命令。对于更聪明的不死生物的反应可能取决于遭遇发生的条件，但如果目标的存在并不奇怪，它们也可能会忽视目标，除非目标表现出可疑行为。",
	"You touch a willing creature and create a shimmering shield of energy to protect it. The shield grants the target a +5 bonus to AC and gives it resistance against nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the duration of the spell.": "你触摸一个愿意的生物，并创造出一道闪烁的能量护盾来保护它。在法术持续期间，该护盾为目标提供+5点AC加值，并使其对非魔法来源的钝击、穿刺和斩击伤害具有抗性。",
	"In addition, the shield can reflect hostile spells back at their casters. When the target makes a successful saving throw against a hostile spell, the caster of the spell immediately becomes the spell's new target. The caster is entitled to the appropriate saving throw against the returned spell, if any, and is affected by the spell as if it came from a spellcaster of the caster's level.": "此外，盾牌可以将敌对法术反射回施法者。当目标成功通过对抗敌对法术的豁免检定时，法术的施法者立即成为该法术的新目标。施法者有权对抗被反射的法术，如果需要的话，并且受到的法术影响就好像它来自施法者等级的法术施放者。",
	"Your jaws distend and dozens of thin, slimy tentacles emerge from your mouth to grasp and bind your opponents. Make a melee spell attack against a foe within 15 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to {@dice 2d6} + your Strength modifier and is {@condition grappled} (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained} and it takes the same damage at the start of each of your turns. You can grapple only one creature at a time.": "你的下颚张开，数十根细长、黏滑的触手从你的嘴里伸出，抓住并捆绑住你的对手。对距离你15英尺内的敌人进行一次近战法术攻击。命中后，目标受到钝击伤害，伤害值为{@dice 2d6} + 你的力量调整值，并被{@condition grappled}（逃脱 DC 等于你的法术豁免 DC）。直到这个擒抱结束，目标被{@condition restrained}，并且在你的每个回合开始时受到相同的伤害。你一次只能擒抱一个生物。",
	"The Armor Class of the tentacles is equal to yours. If they take slashing damage equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier from a single attack, enough tentacles are severed to enable a {@condition grappled} creature to escape. Severed tentacles are replaced by new ones at the start of your turn. Damage dealt to the tentacles doesn't affect your hit points.": "触手的护甲等同于你的护甲等级。如果它们受到一次攻击造成的斩击伤害等于5 + 你的体质调整值，足够多的触手会被切断，使得一个{@condition grappled}生物可以逃脱。被切断的触手会在你的回合开始时被新的触手替代。对触手造成的伤害不会影响你的生命值。",
	"While the spell is in effect, you are incapable of speech and can't cast spells that have verbal components.": "在这个法术生效期间，你无法言语，并且无法施放需要语言组成部分的法术。",
	"This spell creates a wall of swinging axes from the pile of miniature axes you provide when casting the spell. The wall fills a rectangle 10 feet wide, 10 feet high, and 20 feet long. The wall has a base speed of 50 feet, but it can't take the {@action Dash} action. It can make up to four attacks per round on your turn, using your spell attack modifier to hit and with a reach of 10 feet. You direct the wall's movement and attacks as a bonus action. If you choose not to direct it, the wall continues trying to execute the last command you gave it. The wall can't use reactions. Each successful attack deals {@damage 4d6} slashing damage, and the damage is considered magical.": "这个法术从你施法时提供的一堆迷你斧头中创造出一堵摆动斧头的墙。这堵墙填满一个10英尺宽，10英尺高，20英尺长的矩形。这堵墙的基础速度为50英尺，但它不能采取{@action Dash}动作。它每轮可以在你的回合内进行最多四次攻击，使用你的法术攻击修正值进行命中检定，射程为10英尺。你可以将墙的移动和攻击作为一个奖励动作来指挥。如果你选择不指挥它，墙会继续尝试执行你上次给予它的命令。这堵墙不能使用反应。每次成功攻击造成{@damage 4d6}斩击伤害，这个伤害被视为魔法伤害。",
	"The wall has AC 12 and 200 hit points, and is immune to necrotic, poison, psychic, and piercing damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell's duration ends, the wall disappears and the miniature axes fall to the ground in a tidy heap.": "这堵墙的护甲等级为12，有200点生命值，免疫死灵、毒素、精神和穿刺伤害。如果生命值降为0或者法术持续时间结束，墙体消失，小斧头整齐地掉落在地面上。",
	"When you cast this spell, you and up to five creatures you can see within 20 feet of you enter a shifting landscape of endless walls and corridors that connect to many places throughout the world.": "当你施放这个法术时，你和你能看到的最多五个生物进入一个不断变化的景观，其中有无尽的墙壁和走廊，连接着世界上许多地方。",
	"You can find your way to a destination within 100 miles, as long as you know for certain that your destination exists (though you don't need to have seen or visited it before), and you must make a successful DC 20 Intelligence check. If you have the ability to retrace a path you have previously taken without making a check (as a {@creature minotaur} or a {@creature goristro} can), this check automatically succeeds. On a failed check, you don't find your path this round, and you and your companions each take {@damage 4d6} psychic damage as the madness of the shifting maze exacts its toll. You must repeat the check at the start of each of your turns until you find your way to your destination or until you die. In either event, the spell ends.": "只要你确信目的地存在（尽管你不需要见过或访问过它），并且必须成功进行一次DC 20的智力检定，你就可以在100英里内找到前往目的地的路线。如果你有能力重走先前走过的路径而无需进行检定（如{@creature minotaur}或{@creature goristro}可以），则此检定自动成功。如果检定失败，你在这一轮内找不到路径，你和同伴每人受到{@damage 4d6}点精神伤害，因为错综复杂的迷宫带来的疯狂会让你们付出代价。你必须在每个回合开始时重复检定，直到找到通往目的地的路线，或直到死亡为止。无论哪种情况，法术都会结束。",
	"When the spell ends, you and those traveling with you appear in a safe location at your destination.": "当法术结束时，你和与你同行的人会出现在你目的地的一个安全位置。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can bring along two additional creatures or travel an additional 100 miles for each slot level above 6th.": "当你使用7级或更高级别的法术位施放这个法术时，你可以带上额外两个生物，或者每超过6级的位数额外行进100英里。",
	"You sense danger before it happens and call out a warning to an ally. One creature you can see and that can hear you gains advantage on its initiative roll.": "在危险发生之前，你察觉到了危险并向盟友发出警告。你能看到并听到你的一只生物在其先攻骰时获得优势。",
	"You create a tear in the fabric of reality that protects you from an incoming attack by directing it through a second tear close to a creature you can see up within range. The attack plunges into one dimensional tear and out the other one, causing it to be resolved against that creature's AC. If the attack is successful, the creature takes the appropriate damage. You can even make the attacker hit itself, if you choose.": "你制造了一个撕裂现实的裂缝，通过将一次攻击引导到你能看到的范围内的一只生物附近的第二个裂缝，来保护自己免受来袭。攻击穿过一个维度的裂缝，从另一个裂缝中出来，导致攻击生效并针对那个生物的AC。如果攻击成功，那个生物会受到相应的伤害。你甚至可以让攻击者攻击自己，如果你选择的话。",
	"You create four small orbs of faerie magic that float around your head and give off dim light out to a radius of 15 feet. Whenever a Large or smaller enemy enters that area of dim light, or starts its turn in the area, you can use your reaction to attack it with one or more of the orbs. The enemy creature makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 20 feet directly away from you, and each orb you used in the attack explodes violently, dealing {@damage 1d6} force damage to the creature.": "你创造了四个小精灵魔法球，它们围绕着你的头部飘动，并在15英尺范围内发出微弱的光芒。每当一个大型或更小的敌人进入这个微弱光线的区域，或者在这个区域开始它的回合时，你可以使用你的反应用一个或多个魔法球来攻击它。敌人需要进行一次魅力豁免。如果豁免失败，该生物被推开20英尺，直接远离你，并且你使用的每个魔法球都会爆炸，对该生物造成{@damage 1d6}的力量伤害。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the number of orbs increases by one for each slot level above 2nd.": "当你使用3级或更高级别的法术位施放这个法术时，每个高于2级的法术位级别都会增加一个法球。",

	"The spell's damage increases by {@dice 1d8} when you reach 5th level ({@dice 2d8}), 11th level ({@dice 3d8}), and 17th level ({@dice 4d8}).": "当你达到5级({@dice 2d8})、11级({@dice 3d8})和17级({@dice 4d8})时，该法术的伤害增加了{@dice 1d8}。",
	"You create a 30-foot-radius sphere of roiling wind that carries the choking stench of death. The sphere is centered on a point you choose within range. The wind blows around corners. When a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it takes {@damage 8d8} necrotic damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Constitution saving throw. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.": "你创造了一个半径30英尺的旋转风球，带着令人窒息的死亡恶臭。这个球体以你选择的范围内的一个点为中心。风会绕过拐角。当生物在球体内开始它们的回合时，它们会受到{@damage 8d8}点死灵伤害，如果它们成功通过一次体质豁免，则只受一半伤害。即使生物屏住呼吸或者不需要呼吸，它们也会受到影响。",
	"The sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, drifting along the surface of the ground. It is not heavier than air but drifts in a straight line for the duration of the spell, even if that carries it over a cliff or gully. If the sphere meets a wall or other impassable obstacle, it turns to the left or right (select randomly).": "每当你的回合开始时，这个球体会离你移动10英尺，沿着地面漂移。它不比空气重，但在法术持续期间会沿着直线漂移，即使这会使它越过悬崖或沟壑。如果球体遇到墙壁或其他无法通过的障碍物，它会向左或向右转弯（随机选择）。",
	"You create a swirling tunnel of strong wind extending from yourself in a direction you choose. The tunnel is a line 60 feet long and 10 feet wide. The wind blows from you toward the end of the line, which is stationary once created. A creature in the line moving with the wind (away from you) adds 10 feet to its speed, and ranged weapon attacks launched with the wind don't have disadvantage because of long range. Creatures in the line moving against the wind (toward you) spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot they move, and ranged weapon attacks launched along the line against the wind are made with disadvantage.": "你创造了一个强风的漩涡隧道，从你身体延伸到你选择的方向。隧道是一条长60英尺，宽10英尺的线。风从你那里吹向线的末端，一旦创建后就保持不动。在隧道中随风移动的生物（远离你）速度增加10英尺，并且沿着风向发射的远程武器攻击不会因为射程过远而受到劣势。在逆风移动的隧道中的生物（朝向你）每移动1英尺需要花费2英尺的移动力，沿着逆风方向发射的远程武器攻击会受到劣势。",
	"The wind tunnel immediately disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the line. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a {@chance 50} chance of extinguishing them.": "风洞立即将气体或蒸汽扩散开来，并熄灭蜡烛、火炬和类似的无保护火焰。它会让灯笼等受保护的火焰疯狂舞动，并有{@chance 50}的几率将它们熄灭。",
	"You cause the eyes of a creature you can see within range to lose acuity. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks and all attack rolls for the duration of the spell.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is killed, and its body is liquefied. In addition, each creature other than you that's in the line or within 5 feet of it is {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute by toxic fumes.

When it reaches the spot, it becomes {@condition incapacitated}, as it devotes all its attention to scooping imaginary treasure into its pockets or a pouch.": "你让一个范围内的生物眼前闪过一枚金币的光芒。目标生物必须进行一次感知豁免投。如果未能通过，它会看到一个在你选择的范围内的峡谷、沟壑或其他地洞，里面堆满了黄金和宝藏。在它的下一个回合，这个生物必须朝着那个地点移动。当它到达那个地点时，它会变成{@condition incapacitated}，因为它将所有注意力都放在往口袋或袋子里装入虚构的宝藏。",
	"An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends if the creature takes damage from you or one of your allies.": "受影响的生物可以在每个回合结束时重复进行豁免投掷，若成功则结束自身的效果。如果生物受到你或你的盟友造成的伤害，效果也会结束。",
	"Creatures with the dragon type have disadvantage on the initial saving throw but have advantage on saving throws against this spell made after reaching the designated spot.": "拥有龙类别的生物在初始豁免投掷上有劣势，但在到达指定位置后对该法术的豁免投掷有优势。",
	"This spell was first invented by dragon parents to assist their offspring when learning to fly. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet for 1 round. At the start of your next turn, you float rapidly down and land gently on a solid surface beneath you.": "这个法术最初是由龙类父母发明的，用来帮助它们的后代学会飞行。你在1回合内获得60英尺的飞行速度。在你的下一个回合开始时，你会迅速飘落并轻轻地降落在你下方的坚实表面上。",
	"You invoke the darkest curses upon your victim and his or her descendants. This spell does not require that you have a clear path to your target, only that your target is within range. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be cursed until the magic is dispelled. While cursed, the victim has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with the ability score that you used when you cast the spell (i.e. your spellcasting ability). In addition, the target's firstborn offspring is also targeted by the curse. That individual is allowed a saving throw of its own if it is currently alive, or it makes one upon its birth if it is not yet born when the spell is cast. If the target's firstborn has already died, the curse passes to the target's next oldest offspring.": "你向你的受害者及其后代施加最黑暗的诅咒。这个法术不需要你对目标有清晰的路径，只需要目标在射程内。目标必须进行一次成功的感知豁免才能解除诅咒。在受到诅咒期间，受害者在使用你施法时使用的能力分数（即你的施法能力）进行的能力检定和豁免检定中都有劣势。此外，目标的长子也会受到诅咒的影响。如果长子仍然存活，那个个体可以进行自己的豁免检定；如果在施法时长子尚未出生，那么长子将在出生时进行一次豁免检定。如果目标的长子已经去世，诅咒将传给目标的下一个年长的后代。",
	"If you expend your ritual focus, the curse becomes hereditary, passing from firstborn to firstborn for the entire length of the family's lineage until one of them successfully saves against the curse and throws off your dark magic.": "如果你消耗你的仪式焦点，这个诅咒会变成世袭的，从长辈传给长辈，直到家族血脉的所有后代中有人成功抵抗这个诅咒，摆脱你的黑暗魔法。",
	"You plant a silver acorn in solid ground and spend an hour chanting a litany of praises to the natural world, after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes extremely fertile, regardless of its previous state. Any seeds planted in the area grow at twice the natural rate. Food harvested regrows within a week. After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature.": "你在坚实的土地上种下一颗银色橡子，并花费一个小时吟唱对自然界的赞美，之后橡子周围1英里范围内的土地变得极其肥沃，不论之前的状态如何。在这个区域种植的任何种子都会以两倍于自然速度生长。收获的食物在一周内会重新生长。一年后，土地会慢慢恢复到正常的肥沃度，无法阻挡自然的进程。",
	"Choose one of the following effects, which appears and grows immediately:": "请选择以下效果中的一个，它会立即出现并增长：",

	"If you expend your ritual focus, the duration becomes permanent.": "如果你消耗你的仪式焦点，持续时间变为永久。",
	"You create a 30-foot-radius area around a point that you choose within range. An intelligent creature that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature starts to engage in celebratory revelry: drinking, singing, laughing, and dancing. Affected creatures are reluctant to leave the area until the spell ends, preferring to continue the festivities. They forsake appointments, cease caring about their woes, and generally behave in a cordial (if not hedonistic) manner. This preoccupation with merrymaking occurs regardless of an affected creature's agenda or alignment. Assassins procrastinate, servants join in the celebration rather than working, and guards abandon their posts.": "你在施法距离内选择一个点，创建一个半径为30英尺的区域。一旦有智能生物进入该区域或在其中开始它们的回合，就必须进行一次感知豁免检定。如果未通过豁免检定，生物将开始参与庆祝活动：喝酒、唱歌、大笑和跳舞。受影响的生物不愿意离开该区域，直到法术结束，更愿意继续欢庆。他们放弃约会，不再关心烦恼，通常表现出友好（甚至放纵）的态度。这种对欢乐的沉迷发生在受影响生物的议程或立场之外。刺客拖延时间，仆人加入庆祝活动而不工作，卫兵放弃了岗位。",
	"The effect ends on a creature when it is attacked, takes damage, or is forced to leave the area. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can enter or leave the area without danger of being enchanted. A creature that fails the saving throw and is forcibly removed from the area must repeat the saving throw if it returns to the area.": "当生物被攻击、受到伤害或被迫离开该区域时，效果会结束。成功进行豁免检定的生物可以安全地进入或离开该区域，而不会被施加魔法。未能通过豁免检定并被强制移出该区域的生物，如果返回该区域，必须重新进行豁免检定。",
	"When other spellcasters aid you in casting this spell, the spell lasts for an additional hour for each spellcaster other than yourself, up to a maximum duration of 3 hours.": "当其他咒术师帮助你施放这个法术时，该法术的持续时间会因每位咒术师而延长一个小时，最长不超过3个小时。",
	"If you expend your ritual focus, an unaffected intelligent creature must make a new saving throw every time it starts its turn in the area, even if it has previously succeeded on a save against the spell.": "如果你消耗了你的仪式焦点，一个未受影响的智能生物必须在每次它在该区域开始回合时进行新的豁免检定，即使它先前已成功通过了对该法术的豁免检定。",
	"With a harsh word and a vicious chopping motion, you cause every tree, shrub, and stump within 40 feet of you to sink into the ground, leaving the vacated area clear of plant life that might otherwise hamper movement or obscure sight. Overgrown areas that counted as difficult terrain become clear ground and no longer hamper movement. The original plant life instantly rises from the ground again when the spell ends or is dispelled. Plant creatures are not affected by {@i clearing the field}.": "你用一句刻薄的话和狠毒的砍击动作，使你周围40英尺范围内的每棵树、灌木和树桩都陷入地下，使得这片空出的区域没有可能阻碍移动或遮挡视线的植物。过度生长的区域不再算作艰难地形，变成了平坦地面，不再阻碍移动。当法术结束或被驱散时，原本的植物立即从地面上升起。植物生物不受 {@i clearing the field} 的影响。",
	"When other spellcasters aid you in casting this spell, the spell lasts for an additional hour for each spellcaster other than yourself, up to a maximum duration of 8 hours.": "当其他咒术师协助你施放这个法术时，法术持续时间会因每位除你之外的咒术师而延长一个小时，最长不超过8小时。",

	"You plant an obsidian acorn in solid ground and spend an hour chanting a litany of curses to the natural world, after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes infertile, regardless of its previous state. Nothing will grow there, and all plant life in the area dies over the course of a day. Plant creatures are not affected. Spells that summon plants, such as {@spell entangle}, require an ability check using the caster's spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the spell functions normally; if the check fails, the spell is countered by {@i desolation}.": "你在坚实的土地里种下一颗黑曜石橡果，并花费一个小时念诵一连串对自然界的诅咒，之后，在橡果周围1英里范围内的土地变得贫瘠，不管之前的状态如何。那里将不再长任何植物，区域内的所有植物在一天内就会死亡。植物生物不受影响。召唤植物的法术，比如{@spell entangle}，需要施法者使用施法能力进行一次能力检定，检定值需达到你的法术豁免 DC。若检定成功，法术效果正常；若检定失败，法术被{@i desolation}所抵消。",
	"After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature.": "经过一年，土地慢慢恢复到其正常的肥沃度，无法阻挡自然的进程。",
	"A living creature that finishes a short rest within the area of a desolation spell halves the result of any Hit Dice it expends. {@i Desolation} counters the effects of a {@spell bloom|KPDM} spell.": "在荒芜法术的范围内完成短休息的生物，消耗的任何生命骰结果减半。{@i Desolation}抵消了{@spell bloom|KPDM}法术的效果。",
	"You cause menacing shadows to invade a cube 200 feet on a side and 50 feet high, centered on a point within range. Illumination in the area drops one step (from bright light to dim, or from dim light to darkness). Any spell that creates light in the area that is cast using a lower-level spell slot than was used to cast this spell is dispelled, and a spell that creates light doesn't function in the area if that spell is cast using a spell slot of 5th level or lower. Nonmagical effects can't increase the level of illumination in the affected area.": "你让恐怖的阴影侵袭一个边长为200英尺、高50英尺的立方体，中心点位于施法距离内。该区域的照明降低一个等级（从明亮变为昏暗，或从昏暗变为黑暗）。任何在该区域内施放的比此法术等级低的法术都会被驱散，而若使用5级或更低级别的法术位施放创造光线的法术，则在该区域内不会生效。非魔法效果无法增加受影响区域的照明等级。",
	"A spell that creates darkness or shadow takes effect in the area as if the spell slot expended was one level higher than the spell slot actually used.": "一个制造黑暗或阴影的法术在区域内生效时，其效果就好像消耗的法术位比实际使用的法术位高一级。",

	"You extract the goodness from food, pulling all the nutritional value out of three days' worth of meals and concentrating it into a tablespoon of bland, flour-like powder. The flour can be mixed with liquid and drunk or baked into bread. When consumed, it still imparts all the nutritional value of the original food.": "你从食物中提取出好处，将三天的饮食中所有营养价值提取出来，浓缩成一汤匙类似面粉的淡味粉末。这种粉末可以与液体混合饮用或烤成面包。食用时，仍然传递原始食物的所有营养价值。",
	"The original food appears unchanged, and though it's still filling, it has no nutritional value.": "原始食物看起来没有改变，虽然仍然填饱，但没有营养价值。",
	"When other spellcasters aid you in casting this spell, an additional three days' worth of food can be extracted for each spellcaster other than yourself, up to a maximum of 27 days' worth of food extracted by the spell.": "当其他施法者帮助你施放这个法术时，除你之外的每个施法者可以额外提取三天的食物，最多可由该法术提取27天的食物。",
	"If you expend your ritual focus, you can choose to have each day's worth of meals take the form of a single slice of bread.": "如果你消耗了你的仪式焦点，你可以选择让每天的饮食都以一片面包的形式出现。",
	"You whisper words of encouragement, and a creature that you touch gains confidence along with approval from strangers. For the spell's duration, the target puts its best foot forward and strangers associate the creature with positive feelings. The target adds {@dice 1d4} to all Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) checks made to influence the attitudes of others.": "你低声细语鼓励之词，触摸到的生物会因此而增加自信，同时也会得到陌生人的认可。在法术持续期间，目标会表现出最好的一面，陌生人会将这个生物与积极的情绪联系在一起。目标在影响他人态度的所有魅力检定中，将{@dice 1d4}添加到所有魅力({@skill Persuasion})检定中。",

	"If you expend your ritual focus, the effect lasts for 24 hours.": "如果你消耗你的仪式焦点，效果持续24小时。",
	"If a creature you designate within range fails a Charisma saving throw, you cause the target's shadow to come to life and reveal one of the creature's most scandalous secrets: some fact that the target would not want widely known (GM's choice). When casting the spell, you choose whether everyone present will hear the secret, in which case the shadow speaks loudly in a twisted version of the target's voice, or if the secret is whispered only to you. The shadow speaks in the target's native language.": "如果你指定范围内的生物未能通过一个魅力豁免检定，你会导致目标的影子变得活生生起来，并揭露该生物最丢脸的秘密之一：目标不希望广为人知的某个事实（GM选择）。施法时，你可以选择所有在场的人是否会听到这个秘密，如果是的话，影子会用扭曲版本的目标声音大声说出，或者这个秘密只会被私下告诉给你。影子会用目标的母语说话。",
	"If the target does not have a scandalous secret or does not have a spoken language, the spell fails as if the creature's saving throw had succeeded.": "如果目标没有丑闻秘密或没有口头语言，那么咒语失败，就好像生物的豁免成功了一样。",

	"If you expend your ritual focus, the target has disadvantage on Charisma checks instead of taking the −2 penalty.": "如果你消耗你的仪式焦点，目标在进行魅力检定时会获得劣势，而不是受到−2的惩罚。",
	"You fill a small silver cup with your own blood (taking {@damage 1d4} piercing damage) while chanting vile curses in the dark. Once the chant is completed, you consume the blood and swear an oath of vengeance against any who harm you.": "你在黑暗中诅咒着，将自己的鲜血注入一个小银杯中（受到{@damage 1d4}穿刺伤害）。当咒语完成时，你饮下这血液，并发誓要向伤害你的人复仇。",
	"If you are reduced to 0 hit points, your oath is invoked; a {@creature shadow} materializes within 5 feet of you. The {@creature shadow} attacks the creature that reduced you to 0 hit points, ignoring all other targets, until it or the target is slain, at which point the {@creature shadow} dissipates into nothing.": "如果你的生命值降至0点，你的誓言就会被激发；一个{@creature shadow}会在你身边5英尺的地方显现出来。{@creature shadow}会攻击将你的生命值降至0点的生物，无视其他目标，直到它或目标被杀死，此时{@creature shadow}会消散成虚无。",

	"You attune your senses to the natural world, so that you detect every sound that occurs within 60 feet: wind blowing through branches, falling leaves, grazing deer, trickling streams, and more. You can clearly picture the source of each sound in your mind. The spell gives you {@sense tremorsense} out to a range of 10 feet. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on hearing. Creatures that make no noise or that are magically silent cannot be detected by this spell's effect.": "你调谐你的感官到自然界，以便你能在60英尺内察觉到每一个声音：风吹过树枝，落叶，鹿在吃草，流水淙淙等等。你可以清楚地在脑海中想象出每个声音的来源。这个法术使你在10英尺范围内获得{@sense tremorsense}。此外，你在依赖听觉的感知（{@skill Perception}）检定中获得优势。那些不发出声音或被魔法消音的生物无法被这个法术效果探测到。",
	"This spell functions only in natural environments; it fails if cast underground, in a city, or in a building that isolates the caster from nature (GM's discretion).": "这个法术只能在自然环境中发挥作用；如果在地下、城市中或者在一个让施法者与自然隔绝的建筑物中施放，法术会失败（GM自行决定）。",

	"You cause a vine to sprout from the ground and crawl across a surface or rise into the air in a direction chosen by you. The vine must sprout from a solid surface (such as the ground or a wall), and it is strong enough to support 600 pounds of weight along its entire length. The vine collapses immediately if that 600-pound limit is exceeded. A vine that collapses from weight or damage instantly disintegrates.": "你可以让一根藤蔓从地面生长，并沿着表面爬行，或者向你选择的方向升起到空中。藤蔓必须从坚固的表面（如地面或墙壁）生长，足够强大，可以支撑整个长度的600磅重量。如果超过这个600磅的限制，藤蔓会立即坍塌。由于重量或损坏而坍塌的藤蔓会立即消失。",

	"You touch a nonmagical light source and increase its brightness. While the spell is in effect, the radius of the bright light around the source is doubled, and dim light extends for the same distance beyond that area. The light source's duration is halved, however, so that a torch affected by amplify light would burn out in half an hour, or a hooded lantern would burn through its fuel in 3 hours. Adding new fuel to a light source while it is under the effect of amplify light will end the spell and return it to its normal brightness.": "你触摸一个非魔法光源并增加它的亮度。在咒语生效期间，光源周围明亮光线的半径加倍，昏暗光线延伸相同距离。然而，光源的持续时间减半，因此受到放大光线影响的火炬将在半小时内燃尽，或者罩灯将在3小时内燃尽燃料。在放大光线效果下给光源添加新燃料将结束咒语并使其恢复正常亮度。",
	"A line of light 60 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction of your choice. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 10d8} radiant damage and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes {@damage 1d10} fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A successful saving throw halves the damage and prevents a creature from catching fire.": "一道长60英尺、宽5英尺的光线从你身上向你选择的方向辐射出去。线上的每个生物必须进行一次敏捷豁免检定。未通过检定的生物会受到{@damage 10d8}辐射伤害并着火；直到有人采取行动扑灭火焰，该生物在每个回合开始时会受到{@damage 1d10}火焰伤害。成功豁免的生物将减半伤害并防止其着火。",

	"You wrap yourself in a powerful corona that sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Until the spell ends, you have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it, which creates a blast of light in a 30-foot radius. The blast deals {@damage 4d8} radiant damage to each creature in the area while simultaneously healing yourself of an equal amount of damage.": "你将自己裹在一个强大的光环中，它在30英尺半径内散发出明亮的光芒，再额外的30英尺内散发出微弱的光芒。直到法术结束，你对死亡伤害和辐射伤害具有抗性。你可以通过使用一个动作来解除法术提前结束它，这会在30英尺半径内产生一道光芒冲击。这道冲击会对范围内的每个生物造成{@damage 4d8}辐射伤害，同时治疗你相同数量的伤害。",
	"By observing the stars or the position of the sun, you are able to determine the cardinal directions, as well as the direction and distance to a stated destination. You can't become directionally disoriented or lose track of the destination. The spell doesn't, however, reveal the best route to your destination or warn you about deep gorges, flooded rivers, or other impassable or treacherous terrain.": "通过观察星星或太阳的位置，你可以确定基本方向，以及指定目的地的方向和距离。你不会迷失方向或忘记目的地。然而，这个法术不会揭示通往目的地的最佳路线，也不会警告你有关深谷、洪水河流或其他无法通过或危险的地形。",
	"A burst of searing heat explodes from you, dealing {@damage 6d6} fire damage to all enemies within range.

	"You touch one object that measures less than 10 feet in every dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. At the time of the casting, you designate up to six creatures. Only those creatures are able to see and gain benefit from the phantom light.": "你触摸一个在每个维度都小于10英尺的物体。直到咒语结束，该物体在半径20英尺内散发明亮光芒，再额外20英尺内为昏暗光芒。光芒的颜色可以按你喜欢的方式选择。在施法时，你可以指定最多六个生物。只有这些生物能看到并从幻影光线中获益。",

	"This spell intensifies the light and heat of the sun, so that it burns exposed flesh. You must be able to see the sun when you cast the spell. The searing sunlight affects a cylindrical area 50 feet in radius and 200 feet high, centered on the a point within range. Each creature that starts its turn in that area takes {@damage 5d8} fire damage, or half the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature that's shaded by a solid object—such as an awning, a building, or an overhanging boulder—has advantage on the saving throw. On your turn, you can use an action to move the center of the cylinder up to 20 feet along the ground in any direction.": "这个法术增强了太阳的光线和热量，以至于它能灼烧暴露的皮肤。你在施法时必须能看到太阳。灼热的阳光影响半径为50英尺、高度为200英尺的圆柱形区域，以施法范围内的一个点为中心。每个在该区域开始回合的生物会受到{@damage 5d8}火焰伤害，或者在成功通过体质豁免才能受到一半伤害。被固体物体（比如遮阳篷、建筑物或悬崖）遮蔽的生物在豁免扑克上有优势。在你的回合，你可以使用一个动作将圆柱体的中心沿着地面向任意方向移动最多20英尺。",
	"You wrap yourself in a protective shroud of the night sky made from swirling shadows and punctuated by twinkling motes of light.

	"You cause bolts of shimmering starlight to fall from the heavens, striking up to five creatures that you can see within range. Each bolt strikes one target, dealing {@damage 6d6} radiant damage, knocking the target {@condition prone}, and blinding it until the start of your next turn. A creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage, is not knocked {@condition prone}, and is not {@condition blinded}. If you name fewer than five targets, excess bolts strike the ground harmlessly.": "你让闪亮的星光之箭从天而降，击中你能看到的最多五个生物。每一箭只能击中一个目标，造成{@damage 6d6}辐射伤害，使目标被击退{@condition prone}，并使其在你下一个回合开始前失明。如果一只生物成功进行了敏捷豁免，则只受到一半伤害，不被击退{@condition prone}，也不会{@condition blinded}。如果你没有命名五个目标，多余的箭将无害地击中地面。",

Any creature except you that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall {@condition prone} and become {@condition incapacitated} and unable to move. A creature that starts its turn {@condition prone} and {@condition incapacitated} makes a Strength saving throw.

All creatures other than you who view the star must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed} for the duration of the spell. A creature {@condition charmed} in this way can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer {@condition charmed} and is immune to the effect of this casting of the spell. In all other ways, the star is equivalent to a {@creature deva}.

	"You choose a creature within range to mark with a glowing orb of light, which floats 120 feet above the creature's head. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed save, the light hovers above the target's location, moving as the target moves, which enables you to track the creature's direction and distance by staying within sight of the beacon. The beacon continues to function even when you cannot see it, as long as the target remains on the same plane as you. If either you or the target travels to another plane, the spell ends.": "你选择范围内的一个生物，用一个发光的光球标记，光球漂浮在该生物头顶120英尺的位置。目标必须进行一次感知豁免检定。豁免成功则法术结束。豁免失败则光球停留在目标位置上方，随目标移动，使你能够通过保持光球在视线范围内来追踪生物的方向和距离。即使你看不见光球，只要目标和你在同一位面上，光球仍然有效。如果你或目标中的任何一方前往另一个位面，法术结束。",

You also have advantage on saving throws against extreme environmental heat and against harmful gases, vapors, and inhaled poisons.": "微风环绕着你，将你置于一个温和漩涡的中心。在持续时间内，你对远程攻击获得+2的AC加值。你还在极端环境高温和有害气体、蒸汽以及吸入毒素的豁免投掷中获得优势。",
	"You touch two metal rings and infuse them with life, creating a short-lived but sentient construct known as a {@creature ring servant|CCodex}. The ring servant appears adjacent to you.

	"You utter a quick invocation to create a black nimbus around your hand, then hurl three rays of darkness at one or more targets in range. The rays can be divided between targets however you like.

	"When you touch a willing creature with a piece of charcoal while casting this spell, the target and everything it carries blends into and becomes part of the target's shadow, which remains discernible, although its body seems to disappear. The shadow is incorporeal, has no weight, and is immune to all but psychic and radiant damage.

	"By drawing a circle of black chalk up to 15 feet in diameter and chanting for one minute during the casting time, you open a portal directly into the Plane of Shadow.

	"{@spell Charm person} is the classic enchantment, dating to the origins of the game in 1974. Its appeal is obvious: an enemy grants a bit of friendly head start to retreating foes, a recalcitrant informant suddenly becomes talkative, or a town guard agrees to ignore a crime because that's what friends do for each other. The five {@filter variant spells|spells|source=KPDM|subschool=variant|search=charm} presented here all work on this theme but with differing levels of power and specificity.": "{@spell Charm person}是经典的结界，可以追溯到1974年游戏的起源。它的吸引力显而易见：敌人会给撤退的敌人一点友好的领先，一个固执的消息灵通人士会突然变得健谈，或者一个城镇警卫会同意忽视一项犯罪，因为这就是朋友之间应该做的事情。这里介绍的五个{@filter variant spells|spells|source=KPDM|subschool=variant|search=charm}都是围绕这一主题展开的，但具有不同的力量和特定性水平。",
	"{@spell Raise dead} is another spell with roots in the earliest days of RPGs.

	"{@spell Fireball} is perhaps the most iconic damage-dealing spell in fantasy RPGs, so why mess with it?

	"Finally, the third variant here is a {@spell bouncing fireball|KPDM}, which (as the name implies) strikes one location, then bounces according to the caster's direction to a second location and explodes again. This is similar to how {@spell chain lightning} works, but {@spell bouncing fireball|KPDM} attacks multiple targets in both locations. The tradeoff is lower damage against each creature when compared to {@spell chain lightning}.": "最后，这里的第三个变体是一个{@spell bouncing fireball|KPDM}，正如其名字所示，它先打击一个位置，然后根据施法者的方向弹跳到第二个位置并再次爆炸。这类似于{@spell chain lightning}的工作方式，但{@spell bouncing fireball|KPDM}会攻击两个位置的多个目标。与{@spell chain lightning}相比，对每个生物造成的伤害较低，这是一种权衡。",

	"When everyone in the party has entered the room, glyphs blaze into view, covering every inch of the floor, appearing to trap the occupants in their spots. A successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check reveals that the glyphs are used with evocation magic.
