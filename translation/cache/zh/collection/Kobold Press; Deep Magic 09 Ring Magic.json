	"The dwarves long ago discovered the means to imbue magic into metal rings, and the ring wardens were born. With a focus on the school of transmutation, they blend dwarven craftsmanship with arcane might. The ring wardens are rare outside dwarven nations, but they are easy to recognize thanks to their signature ring-staves.": "矮人们很久以前发现了将魔法注入金属戒指的方法，于是戒指守护者诞生了。以变化学派为重点，他们将矮人的工艺与奥术力量融合在一起。戒指守护者在矮人国家之外很罕见，但由于他们独特的戒指杖，很容易被认出。",
	"Starting at 2nd level, you create a special {@item quarterstaff|PHB} with two metal rings embedded in it or fastened around it. You can use your ring-staff as an {@item arcane focus|PHB}. Creating an additional ring takes 8 hours of work with {@item Smith's Tools|PHB|blacksmith's} or {@item jeweler's tools|PHB} and costs 5 gp in raw materials. Your ring-staff can incorporate a number of rings equal to your wizard level.": "从2级开始，你制作了一个特殊的{@item quarterstaff|PHB}，其中嵌入了两个金属环或固定在上面。你可以将你的戒杖环作为{@item arcane focus|PHB}。制作额外的环需要8小时的工作时间，使用{@item Smith's Tools|PHB|blacksmith's}或{@item jeweler's tools|PHB}，并花费5gp的原材料。你的戒杖可以包含与你的法师等级相等的环数。",
	"When you roll damage for a spell while holding your ring-staff, you can add your proficiency bonus to the result. If the spell generates multiple damage rolls against multiple targets (such as {@spell scorching ray}), you must choose which roll gains the benefit before you roll it. You can use this ability a number of times equal to the number of metal rings fashioned into your ring-staff, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.": "当你使用戒指杖施放法术造成伤害时，你可以将你的熟练加值加到结果上。如果法术对多个目标生成多次伤害骰（例如{@spell scorching ray}），你必须在掷骰之前选择哪个骰获得这个加值。你可以使用这个能力的次数等于你的戒指杖上制成的金属戒指数量，最多不超过你的智力调整值（最少为1）。当你完成短休或长休时，你会回复所有已使用的次数。",
	"At 2nd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of {@item Smith's Tools|PHB|blacksmith's} or {@item jeweler's tools|PHB}.": "在2级时，你可以选择获得{@item Smith's Tools|PHB|blacksmith's}或{@item jeweler's tools|PHB}的熟练加值。",

	"Beginning at 6th level, you can add double your normal proficiency bonus with the tools you chose at 2nd level. When using your chosen tools to craft mundane or magical items, you make double the normal progress each day.": "从6级开始，你可以在使用你在2级选择的工具时，额外添加双倍的熟练加值。当使用你选择的工具制作日常物品或魔法物品时，你每天的进度是正常的两倍。",
	"Additionally, you learn the formula to craft a single type of magical ring chosen from the following list: {@item ring of jumping}, {@item ring of mind shielding}, {@item ring of protection}, {@item ring of the ram}, {@item ring of regeneration}, {@item ring of resistance}. At the GM's discretion, you can choose a ring not listed here. You must meet all the standard prerequisites for crafting the ring and pay the required gold as normal, along with any special materials or conditions set by the GM.": "此外，你学会了制作一种特定类型的魔法戒指的配方，可以从以下列表中选择：{@item ring of jumping}，{@item ring of mind shielding}，{@item ring of protection}，{@item ring of the ram}，{@item ring of regeneration}，{@item ring of resistance}。在GM的裁量下，你也可以选择不在此列表中的戒指。你必须符合制作该戒指的所有标准先决条件，并按照正常程序支付所需的金币，以及GM设定的任何特殊材料或条件。",
	"Starting at 10th level, you can imbue magic into the rings embedded in your ring-staff. When you cast a spell, you can choose to imbue the spell into one of the rings. As long as the spell is imbued, you can't regain the expended spell slot. As an action, you can remove an imbued ring from the staff and give it to another creature (or hold it yourself). A creature holding an imbued ring can release the imbued spell as an action. Attack rolls, saving throws, and damage are based on the caster who imbued the ring, but the creature holding the ring counts as the spell's caster for all other purposes.": "从10级开始，你可以将魔法灌注到你的戒杖中嵌入的戒指中。当你施放一个法术时，你可以选择将法术灌注到其中一个戒指中。只要法术被灌注，你就无法恢复已用的法术位。作为一个动作，你可以从戒杖上取下一个被灌注的戒指并将其交给另一个生物（或者自己留着）。持有被灌注戒指的生物可以在一个动作中释放被灌注的法术。攻击检定、豁免检定和伤害都基于灌注戒指的施法者，但持有戒指的生物在所有其他方面被视为法术的施法者。",
	"An imbued ring is considered an ongoing spell for purposes of {@spell dispel magic}. You can have a number of rings imbued at one time equal to your proficiency bonus.": "一个被赋予魔力的戒指在{@spell dispel magic}方面被视为持续施法。你可以同时拥有的被赋予魔力的戒指数量等同于你的熟练加值。",
	"At 14th level, with 1 hour of work (which can be done during a short rest), you can embed a single magical ring into your ring-staff. As long as you hold the ring-staff, you gain the effects of the embedded ring as if you were attuned to it and wearing it (including any negative effects of attuning to the item, such as curses). This ring doesn't count as one of your three attuned magic items.": "在14级时，经过1小时的工作（可以在短休息期间完成），你可以将一枚魔法戒指嵌入你的戒指杖中。只要你握住戒指杖，你就会获得嵌入戒指的效果，就好像你已经调谐并佩戴了它（包括调谐该物品的任何负面效果，比如诅咒）。这枚戒指不算在你的三个调谐魔法物品中。",
	"You can remove an embedded ring (along with its attunement) with 1 hour of work, and you can replace it with a new one at the same time.": "你可以在1小时的工作中移除一个镶嵌的戒指（以及它的连接），并且你可以同时用一个新的戒指替换它。",

	"You can spend 2 hours (including during a long rest) creating a mystical bond with another spellcaster. Both of you must spend this time in meditation, and you must remain within 10 feet of each other. Once the bond is formed, you can work together to bolster one another's magic. When one of you casts a spell that requires {@status concentration}, the other can use their reaction to help maintain the spell. If the caster must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain {@status concentration} on the spell, both of you make the saving throw. If either of you succeeds, {@status concentration} is unbroken. If both saving throws fail, you both lose {@status concentration} on any spells you are currently maintaining and you both take {@damage 2d6} psychic damage from the strain. You can maintain this bond with only one spellcaster at a time. If you create a new bond, the previous bond breaks. Otherwise, it lasts until the end of your next long rest.": "你可以花费2小时（包括在长休期间）与另一位咒术师建立神秘的联系。你们两人都必须在冥想中度过这段时间，并且你们必须保持在彼此之间不超过10英尺的距离。一旦联系建立，你们可以共同努力增强彼此的魔法。当你们中的一人施放一个需要{@status concentration}的咒语时，另一个可以利用自己的反应来帮助维持这个咒语。如果施法者必须进行一次体质豁免来维持{@status concentration}对这个咒语的影响，你们两人都要进行这次豁免。如果其中一人成功，{@status concentration}就不会中断。如果两次豁免都失败，你们两人将失去{@status concentration}对任何你们当前正在维持的咒语，并且你们都会因为过度使用而受到{@damage 2d6}的精神伤害。你只能同时与一个咒术师保持这种联系。如果你建立了新的联系，之前的联系就会断开。否则，这种联系会持续直到你的下一个长休结束。",
	"You have acquired a ring-magic-imbued ring as a token of respect. You gain the following benefits.": "你获得了一枚被魔法注入的戒指作为尊重的象征。你获得以下好处。",
	"You have advantage on saving throws against transmutation spells.": "你对转化系法术的豁免检定获得优势。(transmutation spells)",
	"You can physically bind your ring token to a weapon with 1 hour of work that can be completed during a short rest. While the ring is attached to the weapon, you can use a bonus action to make the weapon magical until the start of your next turn. After activating this ability twice, you must complete a short or long rest before using it again.": "你可以在短休息期间完成的1小时工作中，将你的戒指令牌与武器物理绑定。当戒指连接到武器上时，你可以使用一个奖励动作，使武器在你的下一个回合开始前变为魔法武器。在激活此能力两次后，你必须完成一次短休息或长休息，才能再次使用它。",
	"Ring wardens and others who respect the traditions of ring magic are favorably disposed toward you. Their starting attitude toward you automatically improves by one step, and you have advantage on Charisma checks related to social interaction with such creatures.": "遵循环戒魔法传统的环卫者和其他尊重这些传统的人对你持有良好态度。他们对你的初始态度自动提升一级，并且你在与这些生物进行社交互动相关的魅力检定中获得优势。",
	"The spiked ring in your hand multiplies itself into a long, barbed chain to ensnare a creature you touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target is bound in metal chains for the duration. While bound, the target can move only at half speed and has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and Dexterity checks. If it moves more than 5 feet during a turn, it takes {@damage 3d6} piercing damage from the barbs.": "你手中的尖刺戒指自我复制成一根长长的带刺链条，以便捕捉你触碰到的生物。对目标进行一次近战法术攻击。命中则目标会被金属链条束缚一段时间。在被束缚期间，目标只能以半速移动，并且在攻击检定、豁免检定和敏捷检定中有劣势。如果目标在一个回合内移动超过5英尺，它会受到{@damage 3d6}来自链条刺的穿刺伤害。",

	"You create a 10-foot tall, 20-foot radius ring of destructive energy around a point you can see within range. The area inside the ring is difficult terrain. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can choose one of the following damage types: cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or radiant. Creatures and objects that touch the ring, that are inside it when it's created, or that end their turn inside the ring take {@damage 6d6} damage of the chosen type, or half damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature or object reduced to 0 hit points by the spell is reduced to fine ash.": "你在你能看到的范围内创建一个半径为20英尺的、高10英尺的毁灭性能量环。环内的区域是艰难地形。当你施放这个法术并在每个你的回合的奖励动作中，你可以选择以下伤害类型之一：冰冷、火焰、闪电、死灵或辐射。接触环的生物和物体，当它被创建时在内部，或者在环内结束他们的回合时，会受到{@damage 6d6}选择类型的伤害，或者在成功的体质豁免检定后受到一半伤害。被该法术降至0生命值的生物或物体会变成细灰。",
	"At the start of each of your subsequent turns, the ring's radius expands by 20 feet. Any creatures or objects touched by the expanding ring are subject to its effects immediately.": "在你的每个后续回合开始时，戒指的半径会扩大20英尺。任何被扩大的环触碰到的生物或物体立即受到其影响。",
	"Light wind encircles you, leaving you in the center of a mild vortex. You gain a +2 bonus to your AC against ranged attacks. You also have advantage on saving throws against {@hazard extreme heat|DMG|extreme environmental heat} and against harmful gases, vapors, and inhaled poisons.": "微风环绕着你，将你置于一个轻微漩涡的中心。你对远程攻击获得+2点AC奖励。你还在对抗{@hazard extreme heat|DMG|extreme environmental heat}和有害气体、蒸汽以及吸入毒素的豁免检定中获得优势。",

	"You lay a curse upon a ring that isn't being worn or carried. When you cast this spell, select one of the possible effects of {@spell bestow curse}. The next creature who willingly wears the ring suffers the chosen effect with no saving throw. The curse transfers from the ring to the wearer once the ring is put on; the ring becomes a mundane ring that can be taken off, but the curse remains on the creature that put it on until the curse is removed or dispelled. An {@spell identify} spell cast on the cursed ring reveals the fact that it is cursed.": "你对一枚未被佩戴或携带的戒指施加了诅咒。当你施放这个法术时，选择{@spell bestow curse}中的一个可能效果。下一个自愿戴上这枚戒指的生物将遭受选择的效果，无需豁免投。诅咒会在戒指被戴上后从戒指转移到佩戴者身上；戒指变成一枚普通戒指，可以取下，但诅咒仍然留在戴上它的生物身上，直到诅咒被移除或驱散。对被诅咒戒指施放的{@spell identify}法术会揭示它被诅咒的事实。",
	"You enchant a ring that isn't being worn or carried. The next creature who willingly wears the ring becomes {@condition charmed} by you for 1 week or until it is harmed by you or your ally. If the creature dons the ring while directly threatened by you or your ally, the spell fails.": "你给一枚未被佩戴或携带的戒指施加了魔法。下一个自愿戴上这枚戒指的生物在接下来的1周内，或者直到被你或你的盟友伤害为止，会被你 {@condition charmed}。如果生物在你或你的盟友的直接威胁下戴上戒指，那么咒语会失败。",

	"Dwarves are renowned shapers of the physical world. Earth, stone, and even metal bend to the will of dwarven hammers. It's easy to assume that because dwarves have such tremendous skill at shaping material, they must lack the time and interest to become masters of the arcane, too—but that assumption is dead wrong. Taking unformed matter and shaping it minutely to conform to one's will is the perfect arena for blending the physical and arcane arts. The dwarves' greatest magic has been bound to this arena, as evidenced by the legendary weapons, armor, and implements of war that emerge from their mountain stronghold forges. Comparatively few dwarves pursue the study of magic outside the act of creation or of devotion to their deities, but one discipline bridges the gap between creation and spellcasting: ring magic.": "矮人以塑造物质世界而闻名。土地、石头，甚至金属都会顺从矮人的锤炼。很容易就会认为，由于矮人在塑造材料方面有如此惊人的技巧，他们可能没有时间和兴趣成为奥术的大师，但这种假设是完全错误的。将未成形的物质微妙地塑造成符合自己意志的形态是融合物质和奥术艺术的完美领域。矮人最伟大的魔法已经被束缚在这个领域，正如传说中的武器、盔甲和战争工具从他们的山岳堡垒锻造中涌现出来一样。相比之下，追求魔法研究的矮人很少超越创造行为或对他们的神明的奉献，但有一种学科弥合了创造和施法之间的鸿沟：戒指魔法。",
	"Ring magic is the dwarven art of forging metal into rings, usually with powerful runes inscribed on their surface, and using those rings to shape magic. Practitioners channel their magic through specially prepared rings, increasing the devastation wreaked upon their foes, and they can even imbue spells into a ring that someone else can unleash later.": "戒指魔法是矮人将金属锻造成戒指的艺术，通常在其表面镌刻强大的符文，并利用这些戒指来塑造魔法。从业者通过特别准备的戒指引导他们的魔法，增加对敌人造成的破坏，并且甚至可以将咒语灌输到一个戒指中，让其他人稍后释放。",
	"Rings created for this purpose are more than decorative jewelry. They more often take the form of precious-metal rings large enough to adorn a weapon, a staff, or a suit of armor. Wizards who devote themselves to ring magic are rare outside dwarf lands, but they're instantly recognizable by the ring-adorned staves they carry.": "为此目的而创造的戒指不仅仅是装饰品。它们更常常采用足够大的贵金属戒指，可以装饰武器、法杖或一套盔甲。在矮人领地之外，致力于戒指魔法的巫师很少见，但他们通过手持戒指装饰的法杖可以立即被认出。",
	"The ring is a strange shape to the dwarven mindset, which is firmly rooted in the angles and planes they see constantly in the mineral formations around their underground homes. Dwarf architecture is filled with corners, precise angles, saw-toothed runes, patterns of regular and irregular polygons, adornments of gold laid out in precise geometric forms, and stacked blocks or slabs. These aren't just cultural fashions; such shapes reflect how dwarves think and how they prefer to see the world. Curves are seldom seen, and a circle—devoid of angles and planes, with no beginning and no end—is a foreign shape that denies boundaries and evokes eternity. It is a construct of the mind and spirit but not the chisel; it evokes the sun and moon, raindrops, flowers, and the cycle of the seasons—things that are seen on the surface world but have no place in the hard, subterranean realm of the dwarves. Dwarves make sense of this alien concept by shaping metal into its likeness. Once they can hold this ephemeral concept in their calloused hands, feel its weight and heft, they can better understand.": "这个戒指对矮人的思维方式来说是一个奇怪的形状，他们的思维方式深深扎根于他们地下家园周围矿物形态中不断出现的角度和平面。矮人的建筑充满了角落、精确的角度、锯齿状的符文、规则和不规则多边形的图案、精确几何形式的金饰，以及堆叠的方块或板条。这些不仅仅是文化时尚；这样的形状反映了矮人的思维方式以及他们偏好看待世界的方式。曲线很少见，而一个没有角度和平面、没有起点和终点的圆圈是一个陌生的形状，它否定了边界并唤起了永恒。它是头脑和精神的构造，而不是凿子；它唤起了太阳和月亮、雨滴、花朵和季节循环——这些是在地表世界上看到的事物，但在矮人坚硬的地下领域中却没有位置。矮人通过将金属塑造成它的样子来理解这个陌生的概念。一旦他们能够将这个虚幻的概念握在粗糙的手中，感受它的重量和分量，他们就能更好地理解。",
	"Yet because it has no beginning and no end, because of its powerful symbolic ties to life, the ring is uniquely suited to be a receptacle for magic.": "然而，由于它没有起点也没有终点，因为它与生命有着强大的象征联系，戒指是独特适合成为魔法容器的。",
	"The first practitioners of ring magic gleaned the secrets from visions granted by their gods. The seeds of ring magic were subtle, woven in dreamlike metaphor that was lost on many but needed the dwarves' mastery of craftsmanship to reach fruition. For generations, it was practiced in such isolation that no one recognized ring magic as a growing craft. Over time the dwarves realized that within their longheld techniques, the ore of another secret awaited excavation. These enlightened dwarves retreated deep under the mountains, to a place where molten rock flowed freely. There they carved great halls and forges fueled by the earth's fire. They worked tirelessly in their delve to perfect their new art, and their efforts were rewarded.": "戒指魔法的第一批实践者从他们的神明赐予的幻象中获得了秘密。戒指魔法的种子微妙而隐晦，编织在梦幻般的隐喻中，许多人无法理解，但需要矮人对工艺的精通才能实现。几代人以来，它在如此孤立的环境中被实践，以至于没有人意识到戒指魔法正在成长。随着时间的推移，矮人意识到在他们长期掌握的技术中，另一个秘密的矿脉正在等待开采。这些开明的矮人撤退到山脉深处，在那里熔岩自由流动。他们在那里雕刻了巨大的大厅和由地火燃料的锻造炉。他们在挖掘中不知疲倦地努力，完善他们的新艺术，而他们的努力得到了回报。",
	"Runes and sigils decorate every inch of this legendary stronghold's walls, revealing the secrets of ring magic and its signature spells to those who can read them. Ring wardens understand these writings as well as if they were their own spellbooks. In fact, a gathering of wizards at the walls, preparing their spells to the sound of ringing hammers, is a common scene. But this is a secretive community. The number of outsiders who have seen the halls of the ring wardens can be counted on one hand, and those few are bound to secrecy by oaths sworn on adamantine rings they can never remove. The molten fire forges still ring under dwarven hammers to this day. While it isn't a requirement to study here for a wizard to become a ring warden, it is a pilgrimage all dwarf ring wardens make at least once.": "符文和符咒装饰着这座传奇要塞墙壁的每一寸空间，向那些能够阅读它们的人揭示了戒指魔法及其标志性法术的秘密。戒指守护者理解这些文字，就像它们是他们自己的魔法书一样。事实上，在墙边聚集的巫师们准备他们的法术，伴随着敲击的锤声，是一个常见的场景。但这是一个神秘的社区。见过戒指守护者大厅的外人可以用一只手数得过来，而那些少数人则被誓言束缚，永远无法摘下的精钢戒指所约束。直到今天，熔化的火炉仍然在矮人的锤子下敲响。虽然成为戒指守护者并不要求在这里学习，但对于所有矮人戒指守护者来说，这是一次必经的朝圣之旅。",
	"The following new feats offer options for any character to touch the power of ring magic. At the GM's discretion, a spellcaster who possesses a ring magic feat can learn ring magic spells without finding them in written form.": "以下新的特长为任何角色提供了接触戒指魔法力量的选项。在(`GM`)的判断下，拥有戒指魔法特长的施法者可以学习戒指魔法咒语，而无需找到它们的书面形式。",
	"In the Midgard Campaign Setting, ring magic is the province of the reaver dwarves of the Northlands. Reaver sorcerers and wizards imbue metal rings with their spells and give the rings to their comrades to unleash in battle. Even in Midgard, ring wardens are rare outside their home culture, and they can easily become the object of fear when they're encountered by outsiders who aren't familiar with ring magic. All dwellers in the Northlands, however, know the tales of the ring-bedecked dwarves marauding from their longships.": "在中土战役设定中，戒指魔法是北地的劫掠者矮人的专长。劫掠者巫师和法师会将他们的法术注入金属戒指中，然后将这些戒指交给战友在战斗中释放。即使在中土，戒指守护者在他们的家乡文化之外也很少见，当外来者遇到不熟悉戒指魔法的人时，他们很容易成为恐惧的对象。然而，北地的居民都知道那些身着戒指的矮人从长船上劫掠的传说。",
	"The seat of these ring wardens is hidden deep beneath the northern mountains of Midgard. This delving, known as the Foundry of the Fathers, is where the reaver ring wardens craft the rings that are the root of their magic and contemplate the secrets the rings still hold.": "这些环卫者的据点隐藏在米德加尔德（Midgard）北部山脉深处。这个名为“祖先铸造厂”（Foundry of the Fathers）的挖掘场是掠夺者环卫者打造魔戒的地方，也是他们思考这些魔戒仍然保留的秘密的地方。",
	"The following spells are available to sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards who discover written versions of the spells.": "对于发现了这些咒语的巫师、术士和法师来说，以下咒语是可用的。",
	"Ring wardens and other spellcasters who discovered the secrets of ring magic created these magic items. If your campaign utilizes the magic item creation rules, the formulae for ring magic items are esoteric, similar to ring magic spells. They require the creator to be a ring warden, to possess a ring magic feat, or to discover written instructions detailing the ring magic processes used in their creation. These instructions are separate from the formula itself.": "发现戒指魔法秘密的环卫和其他施法者创造了这些魔法物品。如果你的游戏使用魔法物品制作规则，戒指魔法物品的配方是神秘的，类似于戒指魔法咒语。它们要求创造者是环卫，拥有戒指魔法专长，或者发现详细描述创造过程的戒指魔法指示。这些指示与配方本身是分开的。",
