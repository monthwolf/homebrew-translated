	"Quick as a swift summer wind, a shadow glides over the rippling surface of the lake. Other creatures follow the first, each one just a colorful blur in the air. The forms take shape as they stop above the middle of the lake. Spindly, tall insectoids, their chitin shining with bright metallic colors. The majestic creatures form a perfect circle in the air, their translucent wings starting to flutter rapidly, and they begin a graceful and wild dance. Suddenly, a rush of wild magic surges around them, stirring up the water and rising up high in the sky.": "像夏天的急风一样迅速，一个影子在荡漾的湖面上滑行。其他生物紧随其后，每一个都只是空气中的一个彩色的模糊体。当它们停在湖中央上方时，这些形态逐渐成形。瘦小而高大的昆虫，它们的甲壳素闪耀着明亮的金属色。这些雄伟的生物在空中形成了一个完美的圆圈，它们的半透明翅膀开始快速扇动，并开始了优雅的狂野舞蹈。突然，一股狂野的魔力在它们周围涌动，搅动着水面，升上高空。",

Their little weight and four translucent wings make Akitu excellent fliers. Beauty is everything in akituan society and as such, every one of them tries to maintain a perfect exterior.

	"The origins of the Akitu are a mystery to many scholars of Insectopia. Many believed they appeared one day through a passage from the Feywild.

	"The Akitu have very short lives; as such, they live in small tribes. While they are nymph they are taught the ways of the tribe. Those that have a strong spiritual connection with the fey are trained to become sages. Most tribes are lead by one elder sage who seeks guidance from the tribe's patron fey. Since no Akitu lives long enough to lead their tribe wisely, they lay all of their trust in their patron fey. However, the chaotic nature of the fey leads to the unpredictable behavior of akituan tribes.": "阿基图人的生命非常短暂；因此，他们生活在小部落里。当他们还是仙女的时候，他们被教导部落的方式。那些与精灵有强烈精神联系的人被训练成圣人。大多数部落都由一位长老贤者领导，他从部落的守护神费伊那里寻求指导。由于没有一个阿基图人活得足够长，可以明智地领导他们的部落，所以他们把所有的信任放在他们的守护神费伊身上。然而，费伊的混乱性质导致了阿基坦部落的不可预测的行为。",

Suddenly, a bolt cuts through the night, piercing the spider and with a crack that shattered the silence, killed the fiend. The carcass of the spider is sprawled across the ground, the bolt between its still twitching fangs. As the mother of the larvae comes running towards it, she looks for the mysterious savior. The vespoid shrieks again, as she sees a set of eight legs adjusting. As she quickly runs away, her child clutched in her arms, the eight googely eyes blink from the darkness. The arach huntsman sighs, as they knock another bolt, just in case.": "这只巨大的畸形蜘蛛向它的猎物--一只年轻的幼虫飞奔而去，它的獠牙上滴着酸液。幼虫的母亲在痛苦中尖叫，因为她的孩子即将被吞噬。突然，一道闪电划破夜幕，刺穿了蜘蛛，随着一声打破寂静的裂响，杀死了这个恶魔。蜘蛛的尸体横七竖八地躺在地上，螺栓在它仍然抽搐的獠牙之间。当幼虫的母亲向它跑来时，她在寻找那个神秘的救世主。青虫再次尖叫，因为她看到一组八条腿正在调整。当她迅速跑开，怀里紧紧抱着她的孩子时，八只鹅卵石般的眼睛从黑暗中眨动。猎手叹了口气，因为他们又敲了一个螺栓，以防万一。",

For some their strong chitin is a sturdy and protective shield, others use their vibrant appearance to charm their way through life.

Jumping from his hiding spot amidst the branches, the locust sees his millipede wrapped around the leader of the muscans. Raising his bow, drawing an arrow and firing. The locust drops an undead beetle to the ground, and with a stringent noise from his legs and wings, calls forth his kin to assist him.": "一只孤独的蝗虫在荒野中漫步，跟踪着一群最近闯入的麝香人。很快，他听到了恐慌的嗡嗡声和苍蝇的亡灵被召唤的非自然呻吟声。蝗虫从树枝中的藏身处跳出来，看到他的千足虫缠住了麝香人的首领。举起他的弓，抽出一支箭并射击。蝗虫把一只不死的甲虫扔到地上，用他的腿和翅膀发出严格的声音，召唤出他的亲属来协助他。",

	"The locusts have an almost innate sense for hunting, having always maintained close ties with the wilderness where they dwell. Their natural connection with beasts allows them to gain their assistance, and own knowledge of the terrain makes their mobility almost mystical in the eyes of outsiders.

However, most locusts are very loyal and to earn one's trust is to gain their friendship.": "蝗虫对狩猎有一种几乎与生俱来的感觉，他们一直与自己居住的荒野保持着密切的联系。他们与野兽的天然联系使他们能够获得它们的帮助，而自己对地形的了解使他们的行动力在外人眼中几乎是神秘的。尽管蝗虫声称自己是中立的，但由于他们以前在蟋蟀手下被奴役，所以对其他种族根本不信任。然而，大多数蝗虫是非常忠诚的，赢得一个人的信任就是获得他们的友谊。",
	"While locusts still bear grudges of the past, most crickets have long since forgotten their previous position as nobles of Evergreen.

Additionally, when you attack with a weapon that has the versatile property, you always use the higher damage die, even when you are attacking with only using one hand.": "熟练的Formicoid战士可以使用极重的武器作战。你可以只用一只手来代替双手武器进行攻击，但这样做的攻击在攻击卷上有劣势。用一只手挥舞的双手近战武器仍然保持其双手属性，因此不能用于双武器战斗。此外，当你使用具有多功能属性的武器进行攻击时，你总是使用较高的伤害模子，即使你只用一只手进行攻击。",
	" You can speak, read and write Common, Insect-Common and Formidian. Similar to other Insectoid languages, Formidian is spoken not only with words, but also gestures and pheromones. Formidian is a fairly simplistic language and consists mostly of short, but very straight-forward, phrases.": " 你可以说、读和写普通话、昆虫普通话和Formidian。与其他昆虫类语言类似，Formidian不仅使用文字，而且还使用手势和信息素。Formidian是一种相当简单的语言，主要由简短但非常直接的短语组成。",
	"A lone Firefly adventurer stalks through an ancient tunnel. As he crawls through a particularly small crevice, he finally sees an exit. He finds himself atop a cliff on a stone wall of a gigantic cave. A vast metropolis spans out through the whole cave beneath him, houses masterfully carved into the hard stone. The streets below bustle with life, as thousands of Formicoids make their way through the city. The adventurer is in awe of the vastness that expands before him, so much so, that he doesn't notice the Formicoid soldiers that walked up behind him.": "一个孤独的萤火虫冒险家在一个古老的隧道中漫步。当他爬过一个特别小的缝隙时，他终于看到一个出口。他发现自己在一个巨大的洞穴的石壁上的悬崖上。在他的脚下，一个巨大的都市横跨了整个洞穴，房屋被巧妙地雕刻在坚硬的石头上。下面的街道熙熙攘攘，数以千计的Formicoids在城市中穿梭。冒险家对他面前的广袤感到敬畏，以至于他没有注意到在他身后走来的Formicoid士兵。",
	"Formicoids are ant-like Insectoids that stand from 5 to over 7 feet tall. Most of the Formicoids are tall and lean, deceivingly so, as they are actually very strong. Formicoids are one of the strongest races found on Insectopia and some of them can carry loads up to 10 times their own body weight. Their chitin generally varies in color only slightly, from dark brown to gray and black. There are some exceptions of course, as some races of Formicoids display more vibrant chitinous plating.": "Formicoids是类似蚂蚁的昆虫类，身高从5英尺到7英尺以上。大多数Formicoids都是高而瘦的，骗人的，因为他们实际上非常强壮。Formicoids是在Insectopia上发现的最强壮的种族之一，它们中的一些人可以携带多达其自身体重10倍的负荷。它们的甲壳素一般只在颜色上略有不同，从深棕色到灰色和黑色。当然也有一些例外，因为有些种族的Formicoids显示出更加鲜艳的甲壳质镀层。",
	"Hard-working, serious, and humorless, these are the prejudices many Insectoids hold against the Formicoids. And even though not every Formicoid has these traits, as a race they come quite close. Most Formicoids live their lives as eager workers for their queens. With their immense strength and durability, they make excellent builders, and the more intelligent individuals make amazing architects. Formicoids may tolerate other Insectoids but tend to stay with their own kind. It is rare that a Formicoid joins a diverse group of bugs, but when they do it shows great trust in their allies.": "勤奋、严肃、不苟言笑，这些都是许多昆虫人对Formicoids的偏见。尽管不是每个Formicoid都有这些特征，但作为一个种族，他们非常接近。大多数Formicoids的生活是为它们的女王做热心的工人。由于它们具有巨大的力量和耐久性，它们是优秀的建筑者，而更聪明的个体则是惊人的建筑师。Formicoids可能会容忍其他昆虫类，但倾向于与自己的同类呆在一起。虫族很少加入不同的虫族群体，但当它们加入时，显示出对盟友的极大信任。",
	"The Kingdoms of Formicoids have the most interesting architecture and most intriguing cities you can find anywhere in Insectopia. On the surface, Formicoid settlements don't look very impressive. However, these small settlements, called Hill Cities, are merely gateways that lead through big tunnel entrances in their centers into huge caverns. Those tunnel systems deep below are the real masterwork of formidian architecture. Here a curious spectator can find labyrinths of tunnels, leading into different underground settlements, with structures and buildings edged into the stone and earth. In this way, Formicoids control vast spaces underneath the empires of other Insectoids.": "Formicoids王国拥有你在Insectopia的任何地方都能找到的最有趣的建筑和最引人入胜的城市。从表面上看，Formicoid定居点看起来并不十分引人注目。然而，这些被称为山城的小定居点，只是通过其中心的大隧道入口进入巨大的洞穴的门户。那些深入地下的隧道系统是福米德建筑的真正杰作。在这里，好奇的观众可以发现迷宫般的隧道，通向不同的地下定居点，其结构和建筑被镶在石头和泥土中。通过这种方式，福米克人控制着其他昆虫人的帝国下面的广阔空间。",

	"Most Luni can live close to a millennium, and see the life cycles of generations of other Insectoids go by.

	"Muscans are small creatures, only about 3 to 4 feet tall. Their hideous round bodies are held up by four spindly and hairy legs. Their grabby claw-like hands are attached at the ends of two equally thin arms. A pair of membranous wings on their back is just big enough to get their plump frames in the air. A muscans chitin is often black or grey, with the most exotic coloration being metallic sheens of green or gold. Their relatively huge compound eyes allow no threat or prey to escape their vision.": "穆斯肯(Muscans)是小型生物，只有大约3到4英尺高。它们丑陋的圆形身体由四条细长而多毛的腿支撑着。它们抓取东西的爪状手附在两条同样细长的胳膊末端。背部有一对薄膜状的翅膀，刚好足够让它们肥胖的身躯在空中飞行。穆斯肯的外骨骼通常是黑色或灰色，最奇特的颜色是绿色或金色的金属光泽。它们相对巨大的复眼让任何威胁或猎物都无法逃脱它们的视线。",
	"For most other insectoids, muscans are little more than hideous pests. Their ghastly appearance makes them the monsters in many a larvae's bedtime stories. As such, muscans are shunned by most people and met with disgust because of appearance alone. Of course, it rarely helps that many muscans enjoy rotten food as a lavish meal.": "对于大多数其他昆虫类生物来说，蝇人(muscans)只不过是令人讨厌的害虫。它们可怕的外表使它们成为许多幼虫睡前故事中的怪物。因此，由于外表的原因，大多数人都会避开蝇人并对它们感到厌恶。当然，很少有人会注意到许多蝇人喜欢腐烂食物作为丰盛的一餐，这很少有助于改善它们的形象。",
	"Muscans are actually not the hideous beasts many expect them to be. In reality, they are pretty clever and are painfully aware of the impression they make on others.": "穆斯坎(Muscans)实际上并不像许多人期望的那样丑陋。事实上，它们相当聪明，并且痛苦地意识到自己给他人的印象。",
	"A muscans life is short, their lifespans rarely exceeding 40 years. Many of them live in a constant state of paranoia that every day could be their last.This makes muscans seem shy or cowardly to others,even though they just try to protect the little time they have.

Many of them quickly pick up a different faith, trying to redeem themselves and remove the dark mark on their being.However, no matter what an exile might try, the tendrils of theWurm never loosen their grip. The further they stray from their patron, the more plentiful thoughts and dreams about their end and inferiority become, pulling many exiles back to the cult.

	"Necrites are incredibly selfish and egocentric creatures. Their goal in life is to achieve a position where they hold power over others. However, this does not mean that necrites are uncultured savages.On the contrary, most necrites favor order over chaos to maximize their personal gain.

	"Even though necritian tyrants rarely treat their subjects well, they manage to unite whole nations under their cause by appealing to their most basic desire: superiority.

Survival in the Cullpines is brutal, it is either kill or be killed, and only the keenest hunters have a chance to survive. These thoptras that mastered the ways of the pines became the Locusts. They sought to empower their kin and rise above the plane's dangers. However, not all thoptras shared the locust's views and sought to leave the dangers of the Cullpines behind for good. They managed to transport themselves onto the Material Plane, which strengthened their innate magic. Drunk with power, the crickets betrayed their own kin, enslaving the locusts with their magics as they sought to rise as the new leaders of their people. With their loyal and brutal locust enforces and vile spells, the crickets build a tyranny on the back of thousands of insectoid slaves.

	"Locusts have an almost innate sense of hunting. Since their past in the Cullpines, they have always maintained close ties with the wilderness they dwell in. Their natural connection with beasts allows them to gain their assistance, and their own knowledge of the terrain makes their mobility almost mystical in the eyes of outsiders. Locust hunting swarms seem to work with an unearthly sense of unity and efficiency. Despite their claim of neutrality, locusts are simply distrustful of other races due to their previous enslavement under the crickets. However, most locusts are very loyal and to earn one's trust is to gain their friendship.": "蝗虫们几乎天生具有狩猎的本能。自从在卡尔平斯（Cullpines）的过去，他们一直与自己居住的荒野保持着密切联系。他们与野兽的自然联系使他们能够获得它们的帮助，而他们对地形的了解使他们的移动在外人眼中几乎是神秘的。蝗虫狩猎群似乎以一种超自然的统一和高效率工作。尽管他们声称保持中立，但蝗虫们对其他种族的不信任源自他们在蟋蟀（crickets）的奴役下的经历。然而，大多数蝗虫非常忠诚，赢得他们的信任就等于赢得他们的友谊。",
