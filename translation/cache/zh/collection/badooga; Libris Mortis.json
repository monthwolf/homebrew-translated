	"If an effect says, for example, \"the target takes 14 ({@damage 4d6}) fire damage (DC 15 Dexterity save for half)\", it means that the target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 ({@damage 4d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "如果一个效果说，例如，“目标受到14 ({@damage 4d6}) 火焰伤害（敏捷豁免 DC 15，成功豁免则减半）”，这意味着目标必须进行一次 DC 15 的敏捷豁免检定，未通过检定则受到14 ({@damage 4d6}) 火焰伤害，通过检定则伤害减半。",
	"A creature is {@condition bloodied|LM} when it has half of its hit points or fewer remaining. This doesn't do anything by itself, but some effects might only trigger or apply when a creature is bloodied.": "当生物剩余一半或更少的生命值时，它被称为{@condition bloodied|LM}。这本身不会产生任何效果，但有些效果可能只会在生物受伤时触发或应用。",
	"Some creatures have spells that apply to them constantly without the need for concentration, as denoted in the Spellcasting section of their stat blocks. If dispelled (e.g. by {@spell dispel magic}), the creature can recast it at will, without providing material components; when it does so, the spell becomes constant once again.": "一些生物拥有无需集中注意力就能持续施放的法术，如其属性块中的施法部分所示。如果被驱散（例如，通过{@spell dispel magic}），生物可以随意重新施放该法术，无需提供材料组件；在这样做时，法术再次变为持续效果。",
	"When a creature suffers some amount of {@condition health drain|LM}, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the value given in the triggering effect (typically equal to some amount of damage taken). This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.": "当一个生物受到{@condition health drain|LM}数量的伤害时，其生命值上限会减少一个与触发效果中给定数值相等的数值（通常等同于受到的伤害数量）。这个减少持续到目标完成一次长休。如果这个效果将目标的生命值上限减至0，目标将死亡。",
	"A living creature is any creature that isn't an undead or construct. Constructs are neither alive nor dead.": "任何不是不死生物或者构造物的生物都被称为活物。构造物既不是活着的也不是死的。",
	"A creature with {@sense darkvision} can't see through magical darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.": "拥有{@sense darkvision}的生物无法穿透魔法黑暗，非魔法光线也无法照亮它。",
	"If an effect with a saving throw made to avoid it is appended with \"(save ends)\", the target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful one.": "如果一个需要进行豁免投骰来避免的效果后面加上\"(豁免结束)\"，目标可以在每个回合结束时重复进行豁免投骰，成功后效果将在自身身上结束。",
	"Abilities and other features that target or damage objects only target objects that aren't being worn or carried, unless the DM rules otherwise.": "只有当目标物品没有被穿戴或携带时，能力和其他特性才能对其造成伤害或影响，除非DM另有规定。",

During this time, the target has disadvantage on Strength checks and saving throws, and it only deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength.": "当暗影生物对一名生物造成伤害时，目标会被虚弱直到暗影生物的下一个回合结束。在此期间，目标在力量检定和豁免 throws 时都有劣势，并且只能用力量进行的武器攻击造成的伤害减半。",
	"Two of the legendary undead presented in {@book Libris Mortis|LM} are deities. While deities usualy can't be defeated, some adventurers are foolish enough to challenge one to combat; furthermore, extreme circumstances may warrant intervention by a deity's avatar. So, this book takes the route of creating stat blocks for these deities, the mechanics of which are described in the sections below.": "{@book Libris Mortis|LM}中呈现的两位传奇不死生物是神明。虽然通常神明无法被打败，但有些冒险者愚蠢到挑战其中一位进行战斗；此外，极端情况可能需要神明的化身介入。因此，这本书选择为这些神明创建属性块，其机制在下面的章节中描述。",
	"The mere idea of having statistics for a deity is already controversial enough—after all, if it can be statted, it can be killed by a foolhardy adventuring power. However, the notion of fighting a god's avatar is far more agreeable, so at minimum, I wanted to provide statistics for those.": "仅仅想到为一个神明制作统计数据就已经够具争议性了——毕竟，如果它可以被统计，那么它就可以被一个鲁莽的冒险者所杀。然而，与之相比，与神的化身战斗的概念更加可接受，因此，至少我想为那些提供统计数据。",

	"There are no official rules for Challenge Ratings beyond 30 in 5e.": "在第5版中，超过30的挑战等级（Challenge Ratings）没有官方规则。",
	"Making stat blocks for a deity and its avatar means doing almost twice as much work.": "为一个神明及其化身制作属性块意味着要做将近两倍的工作。",
	"First, I looked at the precedents. 4th Edition includes separate stat blocks for a deity and its avatar, as well as a discussion of the conditions necessary to truly kill the deity. Meanwhile, 5th Edition gives an outdated CR 30 stat block for {@creature Tiamat|RoT} in {@adventure Rise of Tiamat|RoT} with five legendary actions, CR 30 mythic stat blocks for the aspects of {@creature Aspect of Bahamut|FTD|Bahamut} and {@creature Aspect of Tiamat|FTD|Tiamat} in {@book Fizban's|FTD}, while {@adventure Icewind Dale|idrotf} gives {@creature Auril (First Form)|idrotf|Auril} three distinct legendary stat blocks (CR 9, 10, 11) that she cycles between.": "首先，我查看了先例。第4版包括一个神和其分身的独立属性块，以及讨论真正杀死神所需的条件。与此同时，第5版为{@creature Tiamat|RoT}在{@adventure Rise of Tiamat|RoT}提供了一个过时的CR 30属性块，带有五个传奇行动，为{@book Fizban's|FTD}的{@creature Aspect of Bahamut|FTD|Bahamut}和{@creature Aspect of Tiamat|FTD|Tiamat}的神话级CR 30属性块，而{@adventure Icewind Dale|idrotf}则给出{@creature Auril (First Form)|idrotf|Auril}三个不同的传奇属性块（CR 9、10、11），她在这些属性块之间循环切换。",
	"Auril switching to a new stat block each phase is equal in power to gaining a mythic trait and its associated mythic actions. So, inspired by her mechanics, I came up with the following design:": "奥瑞尔在每个阶段切换到一个新的属性块，与获得一个神话特质及其相关的神话行动的力量相等。因此，受她的机制启发，我设计了以下内容：",
	"Deities cap out at CR 30, just as other monsters do. Greater deities are usually between CR 20 and 30, while lesser ones can dip even lower.": "神明的挑战等级上限为30，就像其他怪物一样。更强大的神通常在挑战等级20到30之间，而较弱的神甚至可能更低。",
	"Deities have five legendary actions instead of three.": "神祗有五个传奇动作，而不是三个。",
	"Deities have three phases. By default, they are separated by two mythic traits, and the deity gains new mythic actions during the second and third phases.": "神祗有三个阶段。默认情况下，它们由两个神话特质分隔，神祗在第二和第三阶段获得新的神话行动。",
	"To avoid having to make an entirely new stat block for the avatar, the avatar can be represented by removing one of the mythic traits from the full deity, making it a normal mythic monster.": "为了避免必须为化身创建全新的属性块，可以通过从完整神明的神话特质中移除一个，将其表示为普通的神话怪物，来代表化身。",
	"Deities discorporate if you kill them, unless you manage to satisfy certain conditions set by the DM. This means that even if a deity can be bested in combat, doing so won't permanently change the pantheon of the setting.": "如果你杀死了神明，他们会解体，除非你成功满足DM设定的某些条件。这意味着即使一个神明在战斗中被打败，这并不会永久改变游戏世界的神祇体系。",
	"For the DMs that want fightable gods, this allows the party to test their might against an epic three phase boss fight; this design has in fact been playtested and has received positive feedback. For the DMs that don't want fightable gods, they can simply not allow the full deity to be fought. For both camps, running a deity's avatar becomes as simple as removing a single entry from a stat block.": "对于想要可战斗的神明的DM们，这让玩家团队可以在一个史诗般的三阶段BOSS战中测试他们的力量；这一设计实际上已经经过了游戏测试，并获得了积极的反馈。对于不想要可战斗的神明的DM们，他们可以简单地不允许完整的神明被战胜。对于两种阵营，运行神明的化身就像是从属性块中删除一个条目那样简单。",
	"Creatures that have the deity tag share the following features.": "具有神明标签的生物共享以下特征。",
	"The deity has {@sense truesight} out to 120 feet and {@sense blindsight} out to 500 feet.": "这位神祗的感知范围为{@sense truesight}，传达范围为{@sense blindsight}。",
	"The deity can speak all languages and has telepathy out to 1,000 feet.": "这位神灵可以说所有语言，并且具有延伸到1,000尺的心灵感应能力。",
	"The deity is immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.": "这位神明对非魔法攻击所造成的钝击、穿刺和斩击伤害免疫。",
	"When the deity dies, its body is destroyed but its essence travels back to its divine realm, and it is unable to take physical form for a time.": "当（deity）死亡时，它的肉体被摧毁，但其本质会回到其神圣领域，暂时无法再次具现物理形态。",
	"The deity is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form, as well as those that would read its thoughts, determine if it is lying, or magically influence its thoughts or behavior.": "这位神明对任何试图改变其形态的法术或效果都免疫，也对那些试图读取其思绪、判断其是否在说谎，或者在魔法上影响其思维或行为的法术或效果免疫。",
	"If the deity fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. This can be replaced with an equivalent set of features that help defend the deity against devastating effects that would incapacitate it or prevent it from properly participating in the combat encounter.": "如果神明未能通过豁免投骰，它可以选择成功。这可以被一组等效的特性替代，帮助保护神明免受会使其无力或无法正常参与战斗的毁灭性效果。",
	"The deity has two mythic traits, making it a three-phase boss fight; it can choose which order to activate them in as the battle progresses. To represent the deity's avatar, simply remove one of the mythic traits.": "这位神明有两个神话特质，使其成为一个三阶段的boss战；在战斗进行中，它可以选择以任何顺序激活这些特质。为了代表神明的化身，只需移除其中一个神话特质。",
	"The deity is always under the effects of the {@spell nondetection} spell, and it can cast {@spell divine word} and {@spell wish} in combat once per day each. Its spellcasting ability can be Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.": "这位神祗始终处于{@spell nondetection}法术的影响下，每天可以在战斗中施放{@spell divine word}和{@spell wish}，每个法术每天各一次。它的施法能力可以是体质、智力、感知或魅力。",
	"The deity can use five legendary actions per round and has at least three legendary action options.": "这位神祗每回合可以使用五个传奇动作，并且至少有三个传奇动作选项。",
	"The deity has six mythic actions. It gains access to the first three once its first mythic trait activates, and it gains access to the rest once the second one activates.": "这位神明有六个神话动作。当它的第一个神话特性激活时，它将获得前三个动作的使用权限，而当第二个特性激活时，它将获得剩余动作的使用权限。",
	"When a deity is reduced to 0 hit points after all of its mythic traits have been exhausted, the deity's mind leaves its body and the deity is unable to assume physical form for some time. The discorporation usually lasts at least a few months, and it can last up to several years. During this time, the deity's power is weaker, but it is far from negligible.": "当一个神明的生命值降至0点后，所有神话特质都已耗尽，神明的意识离开了它的身体，神明无法一段时间内恢复物质形态。这种解体通常至少持续几个月，也可能长达数年。在此期间，神明的力量会减弱，但绝非可以忽视的。",
	"If the party wishes to truly kill a deity, it must fulfill one or more conditions specific to that deity. This could require destroying the deity's most prominent temple, or finding an artifact that can deliver the killing blow. If the specific conditions are satisfied, the deity cannot discorporate and can instead be killed.": "如果冒险小组希望真正杀死一个神明，必须满足一个或多个特定于该神明的条件。这可能需要摧毁神明最显著的神庙，或者找到一个可以给予致命一击的神器。如果特定条件得到满足，那么神明就无法解体，而是可以被杀死。",
	"In addition to a typical set of lair actions, the deity's influence warps the area containing its divine realm, creating a number of regional effects the party may have to contend with.": "除了典型的巢穴行动外，（神明）的影响扭曲了包含其神圣领域的区域，制造了一些地区效应，可能会让冒险小组应对。",
	"The prices listed for {@variantrule positoxins|LM} are based on the prices for the poisons in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. However, in a setting that heavily involves assassinations and espionage, poisons might be more abundant and cheaper to make. In such a setting, you may wish to reduce the costs of all poisons and positoxins to half of their listed values. For the {@item Basic Poison (vial)|phb|basic poison} presented in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, you can choose to reduce its cost to 20 gp.": "{@variantrule positoxins|LM}的价格是基于{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中毒药的价格。然而，在一个涉及暗杀和间谍活动频繁的背景下，毒药可能更加丰富且更便宜制造。在这样的背景下，你可以将所有毒药和毒素的成本减少到其列出数值的一半。对于{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中提供的{@item Basic Poison (vial)|phb|basic poison}，你可以选择将其成本降低到20 gp。",
	"Positoxins are special alchemical substances distilled from holy water and laced with positive energy. To fiends and undead, a positoxin functions much like a poison would to a humanoid.": "正能毒素是从圣水中提炼出来的特殊炼金物质，并注入了正能量。对于恶魔和不死生物来说，正能毒素的作用类似于毒药对人形生物的作用。",
	"Compared to a normal poison, a positoxin only works on fiends and undead, deals radiant damage instead of poison damage, and causes the target to become frightened of every other creature in place of the poisoned condition. Otherwise, a positoxin follows the same rules as a regular poison.": "与普通毒药相比，(positoxin)只对恶魔和不死生物起作用，造成辐射伤害而不是毒素伤害，并使目标对每个其他生物感到恐惧，而不是中毒状态。否则，(positoxin)遵循与普通毒药相同的规则。",
	"Any poison can be turned into a positoxin through a process that combines it with holy water. A positoxin made in this manner is worth 50% more gp than its base poison; you must use an amount of holy water equal to a fourth of the base poison's selling cost (half of its crafting price) in order to convert it to a positoxin. The new positoxin is identical to its base poison, except that it undergoes the changes listed above.": "任何毒药都可以通过将其与圣水结合的过程转化为正毒素。以这种方式制造的正毒素的价值比其基础毒药高出50%的金币；你必须使用等于基础毒药销售成本四分之一（制作价格的一半）的圣水量，才能将其转化为正毒素。新的正毒素与其基础毒药相同，只是经历了上述变化。",
	"In addition, a selection of unique positoxins and their effects are listed below.": "此外，以下列出了一些独特毒素及其效果。",

Over time, Kas came to envy Vecna's power and began plotting against him. In the final ritual of Vecna's apotheosis, Kas struck out, hoping to become a god in Vecna's stead. Kas's attempt to destroy Vecna failed, but he did manage to sever Vecna's hand and cut out one of his eyes in the epic battle.

	"Kas is known also as Kas the Betrayer and is the sworn enemy of Vecna. He was originally Vecna's trusted lieutenant, but he betrayed Vecna in an effort to become a god in Vecna's stead.

Kas also spends time in a hidden mountainous keep within the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna. The keep is a stronghold of near total darkness with furnishings made from finely polished obsidian.

	"The Academy Necromica was founded nearly one hundred and fifty years ago by the necromancer Xilian, who sought to establish a place where like-minded individuals could come together and share the secrets of the dark arts.

Soon she had a cadre of necromancers, evil priests, and professional killers.": "Necromica学院是由死灵法师西莉安(Xilian)在将近一百五十年前创立的，她希望建立一个地方，让志同道合的人聚在一起分享黑暗艺术的秘密。在接下来的二十年里，西莉安大师慢慢地建立起这个组织，从那些尊重（或崇拜）死亡和不死之力的人中精心挑选成员。很快，她拥有了一群死灵法师、邪恶祭司和职业杀手。",
	"But the Academy was infiltrated by a paladin named Rion, who used his knowledge of the group's inner workings to organize an assault by those who opposed them. Most of the Necromicans (as the Academy's members call themselves) were destroyed, and Xilian herself was on death's door when loyal minions spirited her away.": "但是学院被一位名叫莱昂（Rion）的圣骑士渗透，他利用自己对团体内部运作的了解，组织了一次反对者的袭击。大部分死灵法师（学院成员自称）都被摧毁了，而希莲（Xilian）本人也濒临死亡之门，幸运的仆从将她带走。",
	"From the ashes of the Academy's worst failure came its first great success. Unable to repair Master Xilian's horribly broken body, the necromancers instead performed an unspeakable process upon her, turning her into a lich. With a newfound lease on unlife, Xilian swore vengeance upon her enemies. She knew that patience was her ally, and over the next century, quietly built up a secret but powerful organization dedicated to death and evil. Now, the time to strike approaches near, yet she hesitates, fearing the possibility of another setback.": "在学院最大的失败中，迎来了它的第一个巨大成功。无法修复席连大师那被严重摧毁的身体，死灵法师们转而对她进行了一种无法启齿的过程，将她变成了一名巫妖。拥有了新生的不死之身，席连发誓要向她的敌人复仇。她知道耐心是她的盟友，在接下来的一个世纪里，悄悄建立了一个致力于死亡和邪恶的秘密但强大的组织。现在，袭击的时机已经临近，然而她犹豫不决，担心可能会再次遭遇挫折。",
	"Today, the Academy Necromica prides itself on its strict dedication to evil above petty politics, and thus remains basically neutral evil. Individual members may vary from this ideal, but the Academy itself rarely strays into either lawful or chaotic methods. Symbolic of this ideal is Xilian, the Master of the Academy and a powerful necromancer in her own right. As the organization's founder and most powerful member, Xilian is possessed of a patience born of more than a century of unlife. She does not take unnecessary risks, though she also knows the value of personal involvement in times of crisis. She spends most of her time teaching the students of the Academy, as well as crafting long-range plans for the organization's future.": "今天，(Academy Necromica) 以其对邪恶的严格奉献而自豪，因此基本上保持中立邪恶。个别成员可能会偏离这一理想，但学院本身很少涉足法治或混乱的方法。象征这一理想的是 (Xilian)，学院的大师，也是一位强大的死灵法师。作为组织的创始人和最强大的成员，(Xilian) 拥有超过一个世纪的不朽生命所孕育的耐心。她不会冒不必要的风险，但也知道在危机时刻亲自参与的价值。她大部分时间都花在教授学院的学生，以及制定组织未来的长期计划上。",
	"As one might expect, the Academy welcomes both the living and the dead, and it numbers a few undead (vampires, specters, and the like) among its membership.

	"Unless you run an evil-oriented campaign, the Academy Necromica probably works best as an adversary for your party. The characters might come across rumors of a ring of graverobbers or bodysnatchers, which in turn could lead them to discover the Academy's more vile activities. Alternatively, the Academy might target one of the party members as a likely candidate for vampirism or similar undead transformation, hoping that experiencing death will make the character friendlier to their aims. Or maybe one or more characters are aligned with the forces that brought Xilian and her Academy down the first time. If you have a non-good necromancer in the party, the Academy might even attempt recruitment, but only after confirming the character's disposition towards undeath.": "除非你在进行一个邪恶取向的战役，否则《死灵学院》可能最适合作为你的队伍的对手。角色们可能会听到有关盗墓贼或掘尸者团伙的传闻，这可能会导致他们发现学院更邪恶的活动。另外，学院可能会以其中一名队伍成员为目标，认为他们是吸血鬼或类似不死生物转化的理想候选人，希望经历死亡会使这名角色更友好地接受他们的目标。或者也可能有一名或多名角色与那些第一次击败席莉安和她的学院的力量结盟。如果你的队伍中有一名非善良的死灵法师，学院甚至可能会尝试招募，但只有在确认角色对不死生物的倾向后才会这样做。",
	"It's probably best not to pit the character directly against the Academy at lower levels.

	"After Master Xilian, the most respected member of the Academy is {@creature Uther Kyush|LM}, who oversees all targeted slayings, illicit information gathering, and other criminal activities of the Academy. Most Necromicans value Kyush's personal involvement in the day-to-day workings of the Academy, seeing him as much more in touch with the rank-and-file membership than Xilian. Kyush employs two squads of spies and cutthroats, each comprised of two {@creature spies|mm|spy} and five {@creature thug|mm|thugs} that are led by one {@creature veteran}.

Espousing secrecy above all, these preceptors enforce strict rules that dictate when and where the thralls can feed, so that hunting does not attract undue attention. They also preach the tenets of the cult and are charged with recruiting new members into the organization.": "一个邪教小组试图将其成员限制在每个城市的25名成员以内。如果小组规模扩大，那么这么多吸血鬼的存在可能难以掩盖。在顶层是一位高级教宗，是血脉异端教派中担任重要职责的众多吸血鬼领主之一。这些教宗奉行隐秘至上，他们执行严格的规则，规定奴隶们何时何地可以进食，以免狩猎引起不必要的注意。他们还宣扬邪教的信条，并负责招募新成员加入组织。",
	"The cult has no true leader, but the Masked One is seen as the organization's ultimate authority.

	"Though the members of this order claim it was founded by the lich Vecna before his ascension to godhood, this declaration seems apocryphal. Regardless of the truth, members of this order venerate the deity of secrets as their divine patron. Their aim is to keep knowledge out of the hands of those undeserving to have it.

	"To join the Eyes of Vecna, one must prove one's worth by stealing or destroying an item of forbidden knowledge (such as a rare tome). Beings of evil alignment are strongly preferred, since the Eyes of Vecna must never place the well being of others before the group's own nefarious goals.": "要加入维克纳之眼，必须证明自己的价值，通过窃取或摧毁一件禁忌知识的物品（如一本稀有的书）。强烈偏好邪恶取向的生物，因为维克纳之眼绝不能将他人的幸福置于该团体邪恶目标之前。",

	"Above the cells sit more powerful leaders, who orchestrate the activities of cells throughout a region (often without the cells even realizing they are being influenced by an outside power). These leaders are typically CR 11 or higher, and some are undead creatures themselves (such as vampires or liches).

He has also attracted the service of a few {@creature visage|LM|visages}, though in truth he doesn't know why these undead beings offered their allegiance to him.": "自那天起，德密霍 (D'Milluhr) 不知疲倦地朝着这个目标努力。他本能地意识到这个任务必须对外保密，因此一直保持在阴影中，从不过分延伸他的影响范围。他招募了一小群盟友加入这个事业，包括盗贼、占卜者和各种类型的位面行者。他还吸引了一些 {@creature visage|LM|visages} 的服务，尽管事实上他不知道这些不死生物为什么要效忠于他。",
	"The truth, should D'Milluhr ever learn it, would likely shatter his sanity. The vision was neither a message nor a divine quest, but merely a quirk of fate, an echo of the thoughts of the undead deity Tenebrous when it came into being on the Astral Plane. The visages came to D'Milluhr because they sensed some connection between the theurge and their creator, Tenebrous. Worse still, the quest itself is a meaningless one, since the being known as Tenebrous has regained his lost wand and returned to his previous identity, Orcus, Demon Prince of Undead.": "事实，如果D'Milluhr（德米卢尔）知晓，很可能会粉碎他的理智。这个幻象既不是一条信息，也不是神圣的探索，而只是命运的一种怪癖，是在星界诞生时，亡灵神秘者Tenebrous（暗影）的思想回音。这些面容出现在D'Milluhr（德米卢尔）面前，是因为它们感知到了神秘者和他们的创造者Tenebrous（暗影）之间的某种联系。更糟糕的是，这个探索本身是毫无意义的，因为被称为Tenebrous（暗影）的存在已经找回了失落的权杖，并恢复了他之前的身份，成为了Orcus（奥库斯），亡灵恶魔王子。",
	"But D'Milluhr suspects none of this, and remains feverishly intent on recovering the \"lost\" Wand of Orcus. He tracks down almost every lead, no matter how vague, which leads him on innumerable wild goose chases across the planes. He rejects any suggestion that the Wand is in the hands of Orcus himself, clinging to the theory that his shadowy patron wouldn't have bestowed a quest as hopeless as taking the Wand from the hands of the Demon Prince of Undead himself.": "但是D'Milluhr并不怀疑这一切，并且一心一意地追寻“失落”的奥库斯之杖。他追踪几乎每一个线索，无论多么模糊，这导致他在各个位面上进行无数次的徒劳追逐。他拒绝任何暗示奥库斯本人手中拥有这根魔杖的建议，坚持认为他那神秘的赞助人不会给予一个如此绝望的任务，即从亡灵魔王本人手中夺取魔杖。",
	"D'Milluhr or his minions could run into the characters on any of a number of information hunts. The party need not be involved with Orcus, Tenebrous, or indeed anything even vaguely related to the Lurkers' mission. As long as some tenuous link between the characters' activities and the theurge's quest can be imagined, an encounter between the party and the Lurkers in Shadow can occur.": "D'Milluhr（迪米卢尔）或他的手下可能会在任何一次信息搜寻中遇到角色。队伍不一定要与奥库斯（Orcus）、暗影（Tenebrous），或者与潜行者（Lurkers）任务有关的任何事情有牵连。只要能想象到角色活动与术士（theurge）的追求之间存在一些脆弱的联系，队伍与暗影潜行者之间的相遇就可能发生。",
	"Or perhaps D'Milluhr's quest isn't as crazy as it seems. Maybe he's actually getting close to tracking down the Wand's current destination (and perhaps it isn't currently in Orcus's hands), and the characters learn of his goal and decide to head him off before he gains possession of one of the most evil artifacts in all creation.": "或许迪米勒(D'Milluhr)的任务并不像看起来那样疯狂。也许他实际上已经接近追踪到魔杖当前的去向（也许它并不在奥库斯(Orcus)手中），角色们得知他的目标后决定在他获得这个造物中最邪恶的物品之一之前阻止他。",
	"Some members of Lurkers in Shadow have magical boons that aid in their search for the {@item Wand of Orcus}. These boons are usually bestowed upon them by an echo of Tenebrous's will or some other dark power.": "潜行者中的一些成员拥有魔法恩赐，帮助他们寻找{@item Wand of Orcus}。这些恩赐通常是由Tenebrous的意志回音或其他黑暗力量赋予他们的。",
	"The cultist can't be compelled to act in a manner that would interfere with its goals.": "狂热信徒无法被迫采取干扰其目标的行动。",
	"When the cultist kills a creature or scores a critical hit against it, it magically learns one fact or secret about the target.": "当异教徒杀死一只生物或对其造成重要打击时，它会在魔法的作用下了解目标的一个事实或秘密。",
	"{@creature Tarek Duskwood|LM} is one of D'Milluhr's most competent and loyal minions. They operate both as a lone spy or as the leader of a group of warriors and covert agents tasked with following up on a lead, depending on the needs of the theurge. Though they appear harmless and friendly, their true personality is coldly vicious. Put simply, Tarek will destroy anyone in the way of their goal, and they prefers methods that are unnecessarily painful.": "{@creature Tarek Duskwood|LM} 是D'Milluhr最胜任且忠诚的手下之一。 他们既可以作为独立间谍，也可以作为一组战士和秘密特工的领袖，根据术士的需求来跟踪线索。 尽管他们看起来无害且友好，但他们真正的个性是冷酷恶毒的。 简单来说，Tarek会摧毁任何阻碍他们目标的人，而且他们更喜欢采用那些不必要痛苦的方法。",
	"To the average person on the street, the Minions of the Skull would seem insane. Of course, the Minions know that their worship of all undead beings is the one true way of moving beyond the petty concerns of flesh and blood to achieve perfect immortality everlasting.": "对街上的普通人来说，骷髅使徒(Minions of the Skull)似乎是疯狂的。当然，骷髅使徒知道，他们对所有不死生物的崇拜是超越肉体琐事、实现永恒完美不朽的唯一正确途径。",
	"As it turns out, the person on the street would be right: the Minions of the Skull are absolutely insane. However, this insanity makes them all the more dangerous, since they have no compunction against destroying any living creature who poses even the slightest threat to their goals of universal undeath.": "事实证明，街上的人是对的：骷髅使徒们绝对疯狂。然而，这种疯狂使他们变得更加危险，因为他们毫不犹豫地摧毁任何对他们普遍不死目标构成哪怕最微小威胁的生物。",
	"The Minions of the Skull have no centralized leadership or organization. Each group of cultists—which might number anywhere from a half-dozen to several dozen, depending on the community and the personality of its leader—operates on its own, though occasionally charismatic leaders unite multiple branches for particularly daring or grand schemes. Such alliances rarely last very long, since the innately chaotic nature of the cultists inevitably proves too strong to control.": "骷髅的爪牙（Skull）没有集中的领导或组织。每个邪教徒团体——可能在半打到几打人之间，取决于社区和领导者的个性——都是独立运作的，尽管偶尔会有有魅力的领袖将多个分支团结起来，进行特别大胆或宏伟的计划。这种联盟很少持续很长时间，因为邪教徒固有的混乱本性最终总是太强大而无法控制。",
	"As expected, the Minions draw the attention of many sentient undead creatures. Most don't have the foresight to use the Minions effectively, either spending them in foolish strikes against the living or merely consuming them as food. However, wiser undead (including liches, vampires, ghosts, mummies, and the like) may use the Minions as pawns in grander schemes.": "正如预料的那样，小喽啰吸引了许多有思想的不死生物的注意。大多数不死生物没有远见，要么愚蠢地将他们用于对付活人，要么仅仅将他们当作食物消耗掉。然而，更明智的不死生物（包括巫妖、吸血鬼、幽灵、木乃伊等）可能会将小喽啰用作更大阴谋中的棋子。",
	"Cult leaders, often called Undying Masters, are usually powerful wizards or sorcerers. Since the cult doesn't venerate any of the traditional deities (save for a few who quietly worship Vecna the lich-god), clerics are few and far between. They typically employ warriors and other martial combatants as bodyguards, promising these individuals transformation into powerful undead creatures as reward for loyal service. An Undying Master that has already achieved transformation into an undead uses its new status to gain even greater respect and awe from other minions.": "通常被称为不朽大师的邪教领袖通常是强大的巫师或术士。由于该邪教不崇拜任何传统的神灵（除了少数暗中崇拜巫妖之神维克纳的人），神职人员寥寥无几。他们通常雇佣战士和其他武装战斗者作为护卫，承诺这些人在忠诚服务后会得到转化为强大不死生物的奖赏。一个已经实现不死转化的不朽大师利用其新身份来获得其他手下更大的尊重和敬畏。",
	"The Minions of the Skull make great foes for the party. Since they're irrevocably vile and evil, most characters have few compunctions about cutting them down by the dozens. However, no matter how many the characters defeat, a few more insane cultists always wait in the wings to give them a hard time.": "头骨手下的爪牙是对冒险小组来说强大的敌人。由于他们无可救药地邪恶，大多数角色对剿灭他们并没有太多顾忌。然而，无论角色打败多少敌人，总有几个疯狂的邪教徒在幕后等着给他们制造麻烦。",
	"A typical encounter with low-ranking Minions might occur when the characters run across (or are hired to stop) a group of cultists stealing various relics linked to deities of death. For a twist, have an evil temple, such as one dedicated to Nerull, hire the party to work together against the cult. As the characters learn more about the Minions of the Skull, they encounter ever-tougher cultists until they finally meet an Undying Master themselves.": "典型的与低级手下的遭遇可能发生在角色们偶遇（或被雇佣阻止）一群盗取与死亡神祇有关的各种圣物的异教徒时。为了增加情节的扭曲，可以让一个邪恶的神庙，比如致力于奈洛，雇佣该队伍与邪教一起合作。随着角色们对“骷髅手下”的了解越来越多，他们会遇到越来越强大的异教徒，直到最终他们自己遇到一个不朽的大师。",
	"High ranking Minions are granted boons that represent a partial transformation into an undead being, sometimes as a reward for faithful service, but more often as a way for an Undead Master to gain obedience or loyalty within a given cult.": "高级手下被赋予赐福，代表着部分转变为不死生物，有时作为对忠诚服务的奖励，但更常见的是作为不死主人在某个邪教中获得服从或忠诚的方式。",
	"The cultist doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "这个异教徒不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"A creature that touches the cultist or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) necrotic damage.": "当一个生物接触到邪教徒或者在它身边5英尺内用近战攻击命中它时，会受到5 ({@damage 1d10}) 点死灵伤害。",
	"{@creature Tival|LM} was once a normal half-orc ranger that wanted to live her own life. However, one of the Undying Masters cursed her with eternal life and forced her to become a member of the Minions of the Skull for some undisclosed reason. Compelled by her master to carry out atrocious acts of violence in the cult's name, Tival's mind has been driven to the brink of insanity, but she still searches for a way to remove this curse and to escape the cult's clutches once and for all.": "{@creature Tival|LM} 曾经是一个普通的半兽人游侠，渴望过自己的生活。然而，一位不朽大师诅咒了她，赋予她永生，并迫使她成为了骷髅爪的一员，原因不明。受主人的控制，她被迫以邪恶的暴力行径为邪教效劳，Tival 的心灵已经快要被推向疯狂的边缘，但她仍在寻找一种方法来解除这个诅咒，并彻底摆脱邪教的控制。",
	"This cult worships Wee Jas, particularly her incarnation as Death's Guardian. The members pride themselves on their dedication and discipline and are known widely for their expertise in necromantic magic.": "这个邪教崇拜维·贾斯，特别是她作为死亡守护者的化身。成员们以他们的奉献精神和纪律自豪，并以他们在死灵魔法方面的专业知识而闻名。",
	"The existence of the Ruby Order in a given city is typically public knowledge. The cult respects whatever government rules the land, follows the law, pays taxes, and so forth. It draws many arcane-minded characters to its ranks, and even more seek out the Order for short-term teaching. In some cities, the Order supplies advisors to local leaders, or even magistrates for the courts. Characters used to dealing with \"cults\" as secretive bands of renegades are in for trouble if they treat the Ruby Order similarly, since it has many allies, both legitimate and otherwise.": "在某个城市，红宝石教团的存在通常是众所周知的。该教团尊重统治该地的任何政府规定，遵守法律，纳税等。它吸引了许多对奥术感兴趣的人加入，更多的人寻求短期教导。在一些城市，该教团为当地领导提供顾问，甚至为法院提供法官。习惯将“教团”视为秘密叛乱团体的人，如果他们将红宝石教团类似对待，将会遇到麻烦，因为该教团有许多盟友，无论是合法的还是非法的。",
	"Of the cults presented here, the Ruby Order is the best suited as an ally to a typical adventuring party. As a lawful neutral organization, the Ruby Order can be counted on to hold up its end of any bargain, making it a reliable source of information and other resources to a like-minded party. Monks, lawful wizards and sorcerers, and other characters who share a devotion to discipline can find acceptance or even training among the order's ranks.": "在这里介绍的邪教中，红宝石教团是最适合作为典型冒险队伍的盟友。作为一个中立守序的组织，红宝石教团可以被指望履行任何协议，使其成为一个可靠的信息和其他资源来源，适合志同道合的队伍。僧侣、守序法师和巫师，以及其他与纪律有关的角色，都可以在教团中找到认可甚至接受培训。",
	"Conversely, the Ruby Order can be a steadfast opponent to the characters of your campaign, particularly if those characters tend more toward chaos than law (or even if they simply have a distaste for necromancy). If the Ruby Order perceives the characters as enemies, they have the will and patience to make the characters' lives a living hell.": "相反地，红宝石教团(Ruby Order)可能是你战役中角色的坚定对手，特别是如果这些角色更倾向于混乱而不是秩序，甚至只是厌恶死灵术的话。如果红宝石教团认为这些角色是敌人，他们有意志和耐心让这些角色的生活成为一场噩梦。",
	"As part of their dedication to discipline, the Ruby Order's necromantic boons are centered around the use of necromancy to perform lawful acts and to oppose any chaotic entities that would threaten them.": "作为对纪律的奉献，红宝石教团的( Ruby Order) 亡灵魔法恩赐主要集中在利用死灵魔法执行合法行为，并对抗任何可能威胁他们的混乱实体。",
	"The cultist can spend 1 hour performing a ritual that animates the remains of a dead humanoid. If the humanoid's spirit is free and willing, it returns to the corpse, which rises as a undead in the same space. The undead's alignment, memories, and personality traits are the same as those that it had in life. The corpse may rise as a wight or some other form that the DM deems appropriate.": "邪教徒可以花费1小时进行仪式，让一个已故人形生物的尸体复活。如果人形生物的灵魂自由并且愿意，它会回到尸体中，尸体会在原地变成一个不死生物。不死生物的立场、记忆和个性特征与它生前的相同。尸体可能会变成为死灵或者其他DM认为合适的形态。",
	"When a creature within 30 feet of the cultist that it can see hits the cultist with an attack, that creature takes necrotic damage equal to the damage dealt by its attack (DC 15 Constitution save for half).": "当一个在30英尺内且能看到邪教徒的生物用攻击命中邪教徒时，该生物会受到等同于其攻击造成伤害的死灵伤害（DC 15 体质豁免成功则减半）。",
	"{@creature Marys|LM} is a new member of the Ruby Order, and seeks to prove her worth to the cult by forbidding herself all earthly pleasures. Unfortunately, her discipline is not yet strong enough to achieve this goal. After her periodic \"binges\", she absolves her guilt by smiting those who tempted her. For best effect, characters should encounter her first while in her ascetic mode, to set her up as a disciplined individual, only to meet her later in the midst of debauchery or while striking down her tempters.": "{@creature Marys|LM} 是红宝石教团的新成员，她试图通过禁欲来证明自己对教团的价值。不幸的是，她的自律还不够强大，无法实现这个目标。在她定期的“狂欢”之后，她通过惩罚那些诱惑她的人来宽恕自己的罪行。为达到最佳效果，角色应该首次在她苦行的状态下遇到她，将她塑造成一个自律的个体，然后在她沉溺或打击诱惑者的过程中再次遇到她。",
	"The world knows paladins to be shining paragons who champion lofty ideals such as compassion, nobility, sacrifice, and valor. Such virtuous figures are symbols to the common people, icons from which they draw the strength and courage to stand fast against the encroaching darkness. Yet in every light a shadow lurks—the brightness of these noble warriors is equaled by the shadow spreading from their sinister counterparts, the blackguards.": "世人皆知圣骑士是闪耀的典范，他们捍卫着高尚理念，如同怜悯、高贵、牺牲和勇气。这样的美德人物是普通民众的象征，是他们汲取力量和勇气的图腾，以抵御逼近的黑暗。然而，在每道光芒中都隐藏着阴影——这些高贵战士的光辉，与从邪恶对立面传播出来的黑衣骑士的阴影相等。",
	"Blackguards are shadow warriors who embrace the power of what most people consider to be a vice or a dark emotion. A blackguard's vice becomes a central focus for that individual's divine power. Dominance, fury, and pride are among the forces that blackguards cultivate to fuel their might.": "黑卫士是影子战士，他们拥抱大多数人认为是恶习或黑暗情绪的力量。黑卫士的恶习成为个体神圣力量的核心焦点。支配、愤怒和傲慢是黑卫士培养以增强力量的力量之一。",
	"Because malevolent deities and wicked forces in the cosmos are more likely to hold a vice in esteem, most blackguards are villains. Nevertheless, blackguards who cling to higher ideals do exist. A heroic blackguard might be born when a divine soldier who tries to exemplify virtue cannot control their anger or some other base emotion. Such blackguards are referred to as fallen paladins. Other heroic blackguards cleave to a vice that a non-evil religion or deity promotes as an asset, or they have learned by necessity to turn their negative tendencies into a divine focus so that they can lead productive lives.": "由于宇宙中邪恶的神灵和邪恶的力量更有可能尊崇恶习，大多数黑卫士都是恶棍。然而，仍然存在着坚守高尚理念的黑卫士。一个英勇的黑卫士可能诞生于一位试图体现美德的神圣士兵，但无法控制自己的愤怒或其他基本情绪。这样的黑卫士被称为堕落圣武士。其他英勇的黑卫士坚守着一种非邪恶宗教或神灵推崇为优点的恶习，或者出于必要性学会将自己的负面倾向转化为神圣的焦点，以便能过上有意义的生活。",
	"The power of vice is alluring because it offers fewer restrictions than virtue does. Though the power comes easily, a blackguard always faces the worst temptations of his or her vice, as well as that of other negative emotions that echo the vice. Scruples can be hard to maintain in the face of such a lure. A truly heroic blackguard can never give in and take the easy path.": "恶行的力量是诱人的，因为它比(Blackguard)美德)提供更少的限制。虽然这种力量很容易获得，但(Blackguard)总是面临着自己的恶行以及其他负面情绪的最坏诱惑，这些情绪都在呼应着这种恶行。在这种诱惑面前，坚持原则可能很困难。一个真正英勇的(Blackguard)永远不能屈服并选择走捷径。",
	"Heroic blackguards have a hard road to travel. Their truly immoral counterparts form orders that actively oppose virtuous knights and cavaliers. Whether or not a specific blackguard is a member of such a dark order, those same knights and cavaliers rarely understand that a person can channel divine power through a vice without becoming debased. The common people rightly fear all blackguards the same way they fear the black knights of legend. A blackguard who uses the divine power of the dreaded vices to combat evil still has difficulty finding a wide array of allies. He or she rarely enjoys a hero's accolades.": "英勇的黑卫（Blackguard）走的是一条艰难的道路。他们真正的不道德对立者组成了积极反对正直骑士（knights）和骑士（cavaliers）的组织。无论特定的黑卫是否是这样一个黑暗组织的成员，那些骑士和骑士很少明白一个人可以通过恶习来引导神圣力量而不堕落。普通人正确地像他们害怕传说中的黑骑士一样害怕所有的黑卫。一个利用可怕恶习的神圣力量来对抗邪恶的黑卫仍然很难找到广泛的盟友。他或她很少享受英雄的赞美。",
	"The most important aspect of a blackguard character is their background and how they became a member of this class. Are you a fallen paladin, or did you gain the power of vice via some other method? Did you find yourself unwillingly consumed by negative emotions, or did you willingly plunge yourself into the shadows? Do you seek some sort of positive change, or do you continue to stray closer and closer to evil?": "黑卫士角色最重要的方面是他们的背景以及他们如何成为这个职业的成员。你是堕落的圣骑士，还是通过其他方式获得了邪恶力量？你是不情愿地被消耗负面情绪，还是自愿投身于阴影之中？你是在寻求某种积极的改变，还是继续逐渐走向邪恶？",
	"In particular, take a moment to establish the relationship between your alignment and your levels in this class. Are you an evil-aligned that has fully embraced your dark emotions, or are you good-aligned in spite of them?

Similarly, if a blackguard completes some sort of quest for atonement, they may be able to make a sacred oath that allows them to replace their blackguard levels with paladin levels.": "当一名圣武士{@class paladin}主动背弃誓言，走上黑暗之路时，DM可以选择用黑卫等级替换他们的圣武士等级，而不是使用{@class paladin|phb|Oathbreaker|Despair|LM}中的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}。同样地，如果一名黑卫完成某种救赎任务，他们可能能够立下神圣誓言，使他们可以用圣武士等级替换黑卫等级。",

	"Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a {@filter fighting style|optionalfeatures|feature type=FS:P} you know with another fighting style available to blackguards. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.": "每当你达到一个在这个职业中获得属性分配提升特性的等级时，你可以用黑卫士可用的另一种战斗风格替换你已经学会的一个{@filter fighting style|optionalfeatures|feature type=FS:P}。这种替换代表了你在武术实践中的关注重点转移。",

	"As an action, you target one undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw.

	"Blackguards of domination demand submission from their enemies. They impose order by force whenever necessary, crushing resistance and making others do their bidding.

In the hands of evil, dominance becomes tyranny.": "支配的黑卫要求敌人屈服。他们必要时会通过武力来维持秩序，粉碎抵抗，让他人听命于他们。按照黑卫的条件投降是任何敌人唯一的希望。那些拒绝屈服的人可以期待被碾碎并展示为血腥的反抗黑卫决心的例子。在邪恶之手中，支配变成了暴政。",
	"Most blackguards of this vice are former paladins of the Oath of Conquest. Not all evil paladins of this oath become blackguards, however. Rather, a conquest paladin becomes a domination blackguard when the desire to harm others begins to outweigh their quest to establish order. Enjoying the use of violent force to subjugate foes, as well as taking delight in the suffering of others, is a distinct sign that a conquest paladin has fallen down the path of darkness.": "大多数这种邪恶的黑卫士是曾经的征服誓约圣武士。然而，并非所有这个誓约的邪恶圣武士都会成为黑卫士。相反，当伤害他人的欲望开始超过他们建立秩序的追求时，一个征服圣武士就会变成一个统治黑卫士。喜欢使用暴力力量来征服敌人，以及对他人的痛苦感到愉悦，是一个征服圣武士已经走上黑暗之路的明显迹象。",
	"Despite this connection to the Oath of Conquest, blackguards of this vice needn't serve the forces of law. For example, a chaos-based blackguard that serves a demon lord might use this vice's power to dominate others as a display of their master's supremacy. With this in mind, non-lawful blackguards of domination are few and far in between, typically because some other vice fits their personality more.": "尽管与(`Oath of Conquest`)的联系，这种邪恶的黑卫并不一定要侍奉法律的力量。例如，一个以混沌为基础、侍奉魔王的黑卫可能会利用这种邪恶的力量来支配他人，以展示他们主人的至高无上。有鉴于此，支配之黑卫中非守序的个体寥寥无几，通常是因为其他某种邪恶更符合他们的个性。",

Rather, they draw their strength from the negative emotions associated with their quest to establish power over others.": "一个前征服圣武士可能希望继续信守他们的誓言，如果这与他们作为黑卫士的观点一致的话。然而，一个支配黑卫士并不是从这样的誓言中获得力量。相反，他们从与他们追求控制他人权力相关的负面情绪中汲取力量。",
	"You can use your Channel Divinity to exude a terrifying presence. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes {@condition frightened} of you for 1 minute. The {@condition frightened} creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.": "你可以使用你的信仰通道来散发一种可怕的存在。作为一个动作，你可以强迫你能看到的每个选择的生物在你周围30英尺内进行一次感知豁免投。在一个失败的豁免中，生物会成为你的{@condition frightened}，持续1分钟。这个{@condition frightened}生物可以在每个回合结束时重复这个豁免投，成功则结束自身的效果。",

Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, that creature takes psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if you're not {@condition incapacitated}.": "那些敢于攻击你的人会因其大胆而受到心灵惩罚。每当一个生物用攻击命中你时，如果你不是{@condition incapacitated}，那个生物会受到等同于你魅力调整值的心灵伤害（最少为1点）。",
	"You gain the ability to harness extraordinary martial prowess. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of conquest, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:": "你获得了利用非凡武术技能的能力。作为一个动作，你可以魔法地成为征服之化身，获得以下效益，持续1分钟：",

	"The Vice of Fury is for blackguards who particularly enjoy violence, murder, and the obliteration of their enemies. Many of these blackguard of fury channels raw anger into the violence required for victory. In battle, blackguards of fury are wild killers, impulsive, bloodthirsty, and destructive. They answer every offense or injury with overwhelming retaliation, and their enemies receive little mercy. Allies can expect a blackguard of fury to rush to the forefront of any armed conflict and to bring foes to ruin as quickly as possible. Evil blackguards of fury allow the vice to rule them entirely, not just on the battlefield.": "狂怒之恶（The Vice of Fury）适合那些特别喜欢暴力、谋杀和消灭敌人的恶棍。许多狂怒之恶的黑卫将原始愤怒转化为取得胜利所需的暴力。在战斗中，狂怒之恶的黑卫是狂野的杀手，冲动、嗜血和具有破坏性。他们对每一次冒犯或伤害都会以压倒性的报复回应，而他们的敌人几乎不会得到怜悯。盟友可以期待狂怒之恶的黑卫会冲到任何武装冲突的最前线，并尽快摧毁敌人。邪恶的狂怒之恶黑卫让这种恶习完全控制他们，不仅仅在战场上。",

	"A former vengeance paladin may wish to continue upholding their oath, as it may align with their views as a blackguard. However, a blackguard of fury does not derive power from such an oath. Rather, they draw their strength from their anger, bloodlust, and destructive impulses, and not any commitment to the ideals of justice or order. Thus, rather than punishing evildoers for their sins, a blackguard of fury may focus their destructive ire against anything—and anyone—that stands in the way of their goals.": "一位前复仇圣武士可能希望继续信守他们的誓言，因为这可能与他们作为黑卫士的观点相一致。然而，一位愤怒黑卫士并不是从这样的誓言中获得力量。相反，他们的力量来自于愤怒、嗜血和破坏冲动，而不是对正义或秩序理念的承诺。因此，与其惩罚恶人的罪行，愤怒黑卫士可能会将他们的破坏之怒集中在任何阻碍他们目标的事物和人身上。",
	"As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak words of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being {@condition frightened}.

	"The Vice of Pride is for blackguards who are overtaken by conceit and narcissism. Some of these \"false paladins\" knowingly use this guise to achieve evil ends. Others are paladins that are so deluded in their self-importance that they still believe themselves to be on the path of righteousness, even going as far as to only use radiant smites and other abilities that they perceive as being holy in nature. Either way, most blackguards of this vice use their silvered words and demonstrations of power to influence others to their benefit, some even going as far as to attract a cult of followers in order to be worshiped as a god.": "骄傲之罪是给那些被傲慢和自恋所吞噬的恶棍。一些这样的“伪圣骑士”故意利用这种伪装来达到邪恶的目的。另一些是如此自以为是以至于仍然相信自己走在正义之路上的圣骑士，甚至只使用他们认为是神圣的光辉打击和其他能力。无论哪种情况，大多数这种罪恶的恶棍利用他们花言巧语和展示力量来影响他人以谋求自己的利益，有些甚至走到了吸引追随者的地步，以便被崇拜为神。",

	"The Vice of Treachery for blackguards who care only for their own power and survival, and are faithful only to themselves. Anyone desperate enough to follow one of these blackguards does so because, while deceitful, these blackguards command great power. Those who follow them without falling prey to their treachery hope to indulge in wanton violence and accumulate great treasure. Many of these blackguards pay homage to demon lords, especially Grazz't and Orcus. The Lords of Hell and other beings of Law are loath to ally with these champions of chaos, but sometimes Baalzebul and Glasya find a kindred spirit in a blackguard's penchant for double dealing and treachery.": "对于只关心自己的权力和生存，并且只对自己忠诚的黑卫士来说，背叛是一种恶习。任何足够绝望以追随这些黑卫士之一的人，都是因为虽然这些黑卫士充满欺诈，但却拥有巨大的力量。那些能够追随他们而不落入背叛的人，希望沉溺于肆意的暴力并积累巨大的财富。许多这些黑卫士向恶魔领主致敬，尤其是( Grazz't )和( Orcus )。地狱之主和其他秩序之神不愿与这些混乱的冠军结盟，但有时( Baalzebul )和( Glasya )会在黑卫士爱好两面派和背叛的倾向中找到一种同类精神。",

	"So, I ultimately decided to do a conversion of Libris Mortis, which I would work on back and forth with Elder Evils whenever I'd get bored of the other.

	"At some point in 2022, I discovered Open Grave, the 4e version of Libris Mortis.

	"knightly principles. He is exceptionally proud and never forgets or forgives insults to him or his honor.": "骑士原则。他异常自豪，从不忘记或原谅对他或他荣誉的侮辱。",
	"{@creature Kas|LM} has a twisted sense of honor that compels him to offer the appearance of a fair fight to any creatures he considers equals. He quickly dispatches challengers of obvious inferiority. Kas usually strikes first and without warning, and he attempts to subdue an opponent rather than kill it. He has no reservations about attacking an unarmed opponent, but the creature must have access to a nearby weapon. If a combatant proves a good challenge, Kas transforms the creature into a vampire spawn under his control after he defeats it.": "{@creature Kas|LM}有一种扭曲的荣誉感，驱使他向他认为是对手的任何生物提供公平战斗的外观。他会迅速击败明显劣势的挑战者。卡斯通常会先发制人，毫不留情，他试图制服对手而不是杀死对手。他对袭击手无寸铁的对手没有任何保留，但这个生物必须能够接近一把武器。如果一名战斗者证明是一个良好的挑战，卡斯在打败对手后会将其变成他控制下的吸血鬼子嗣。",
	"Kas is cunning, having learned much of his craft from Vecna. He prefers to fight opponents in areas of darkness, where he has no risk of losing his regeneration. If outnumbered, Kas relies on spellcasting allies that can cast supportive spells on him to ensure victory. Kas revels in combat and tries to engage as many opponents as possible. However, even while engaging multiple foes, he retains wisdom and cunning. Kas is confident of his abilities but makes strategic retreats if necessary. In melee, he disengages with an enemy only long enough to cast {@spell command} or {@spell charm person} on them, which he makes sure to target on the opponent most skilled in melee.": "卡斯是狡猾的，他从维克纳那里学到了很多技巧。他更喜欢在黑暗的地方与对手战斗，这样他就不会失去再生的风险。如果遇到人数过多的敌人，卡斯会依赖那些可以对他施放支援法术的法术盟友来确保胜利。卡斯热衷于战斗，并试图与尽可能多的对手交战。然而，即使与多个敌人交战，他仍保持着智慧和狡诈。卡斯对自己的能力充满信心，但如果有必要，他会进行战略性撤退。在近战中，他只会暂时与敌人脱离接触，足够时间施放{@spell command}或{@spell charm person}，而且他会确保将其瞄准在近战中最擅长的对手身上。",

Kas can choose any number of targets to be unaffected by this effect.": "直到下一轮的20号倡议计数，巢穴中的重力受到{@i reverse gravity}法术的影响，除了卡斯可以将重力定向到任何方向。卡斯可以选择任意数量的目标不受此效果影响。",

	"Shadows cast within the region seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive. While asleep, a living creature's shadow wanders off as an undead {@creature shadow} that seeks to fulfill an unknown purpose. If the creature wakes up, its shadow only returns after the creature is alerted to its absence by a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, at which time the undead shadow is destroyed.": "在该地区投下的阴影看起来异常消瘦，有时甚至会像活物一样移动。当一只生物入睡时，它的阴影会变成一个{@creature shadow}的不死之影，试图完成一个未知目的。如果生物醒来，它的阴影只有在生物通过一次成功的DC 15的感知（智力）检定察觉到它的缺失后才会返回，此时不死之影会被摧毁。",
	"Blackstar knights are undead spirits housed in vessels of animate black stone. Each knight serves Kas unswervingly, though stories of similar beings under the control of other creatures have begun to surface.": "黑星骑士是寄宿在有生命的黑石容器中的不死之灵。每个骑士都无条件地侍奉卡斯，尽管有关其他生物控制类似存在的故事开始传出。",
	"{@creature Blackstar Knight|LM|Blackstar knights} use Death Mark on a single target and relentlessly pursue them using No Escape until either the target or the knight is destroyed, or until commanded by a superior to change its tactics.

	"A character knows the following information with a successful check using the Arcana or History skill.": "一个角色通过使用奥术或历史技能成功检查后，将获得以下信息。",
	"These blank-faced stone warriors house souls bound to their rocky forms. The ritual for creating them remains a deeply guarded secret, and possibly one that Kas no longer controls. The presence of blackstar knights and similar beings in the service of other masters aside from Kas supports the possibility that Kas's defenses have been compromised and his secrets revealed.": "这些面无表情的石头战士寄宿着被绑定在他们岩石形态上的灵魂。创造它们的仪式仍然是一个深藏的秘密，也可能是Kas不再控制的一个秘密。除了Kas之外，其他主人的黑星骑士和类似存在的存在，支持了Kas的防御可能已经被破坏，他的秘密已经被揭示的可能性。",

	"Osterneth prefers only to use her spellcasting as a last resort or to ensure success in an important endeavor; while her spells are cast without components, she still is adverse to the unnecessary risk of being detected somehow. When a hapless fool or perceptive opponent discovers something about her that she doesn't want revealed, she prefers to use {@i modify memory} to erase their knowledge of it instead of killing them, which has the added advantage of allowing her to implant false memories that work to her advantage.": "Osterneth（奥斯特内斯）更倾向于将她的施法作为最后的手段，或者确保在重要的事业中取得成功；尽管她的法术是无需材料的，但她仍然不喜欢不必要的风险，以免被某种方式发现。当一个不幸的傻瓜或敏锐的对手发现了她不想透露的事情时，她更喜欢使用{@i modify memory}来抹除他们的知识，而不是杀死他们，这样做的额外好处是让她能够植入对自己有利的虚假记忆。",
	"{@creature Osterneth|LM} relies heavily on the presence of undead allies, using them as meat shields via Redirect Attack and positioning tools via Transposition. She starts combat by attempting to dominate one of the party's melee combatants, spending her action on subsequent turns to cast a spell or to use Void Lightning if it is available, and then using {@i mislead} and the terrain around her to hide via Cunning Action.": "{@creature Osterneth|LM} 依赖于与不死盟友的紧密合作，通过重定攻击将它们用作肉盾，通过传送来进行定位。她在战斗开始时尝试控制一名队友的近战战士，然后在接下来的回合中花费动作施放法术或使用虚空闪电（如果可用），然后利用{@i mislead} 和周围的地形通过狡诈行动来隐藏。",
	"If threatened in melee, Osterneth uses her Paralyzing Touch to paralyze the threat or Luring Glare to move them away from her. While her Shadow Rays are viable enough to use for damage instead of her other spells, Osterneth is always on the lookout for opportunities to catch at least three enemies in a {@i fireball} or to use {@i power word kill} to remove a threat from the board.": "如果在近战中受到威胁，奥斯特涅斯(Osterneth)会使用她的麻痹之触(Paralyzing Touch)来麻痹威胁，或者使用诱惑凝视(Luring Glare)将他们远离她。虽然她的暗影射线(Shadow Rays)足够有效，可以用来造成伤害，但奥斯特涅斯总是在寻找机会，至少能够将三个敌人困在 {@i fireball} 中，或者使用 {@i power word kill} 来清除威胁。",
	"Once her mythic trait is activated, Osterneth's true malice is revealed, and her trickery only becomes more disorienting to deal with. She uses Vanishing Act to reposition even in the absence of allies, and repels melee attackers that dare to approach her using Disrupt Life. Osterneth otherwise unleashes as many of her damaging abilities as much possible, with her Void Lightning mythic action having a huge blast radius that can potentially hit the entire party at once.": "一旦奥斯特涅丝的神话特性被激活，她真正的恶意就会显露出来，她的诡计变得更加令人困惑。她利用（Vanishing Act）来重新定位，即使没有盟友在身边，还会利用（Disrupt Life）来击退那些敢于靠近她的近战攻击者。奥斯特涅丝会尽可能释放她的伤害技能，其中她的（Void Lightning）神话行动拥有巨大的爆炸半径，有可能一次性打击整个队伍。",
	"Osterneth's phylactery is a decapitated statue of Ioun placed in the central courtyard of the temple—after all, nobody would suspect a servant of Vecna to use his rival's image as their source of eternal unlife. At every summit, Osterneth brings her collection of captured souls and feeds them to her phylactery, providing her enough sustenance for the next year to come. The statue appears nonmagical due to a {@spell Nystul's magic aura} spell cast on it, but can be identified for what it is after 10 minutes of careful study and a successful DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. One of the conditions for destroying the phylactery includes restoring the head of the statue, whether by reattaching the original head or by constructing a sufficient replacement (e.g. using {@spell stone shape}).": "奥斯特内斯的魂器是伊昂的被斩首雕像，放置在庙宇中央的庭院里——毕竟，没有人会怀疑维克纳的仆人会使用他的对手形象作为他们永恒不死之源。在每一次高峰会议上，奥斯特内斯都会带来她收集的被俘灵魂，并将它们供奉给她的魂器，为她提供足够的养分来度过接下来的一年。由于施加在上面的{@spell Nystul's magic aura}法术，这座雕像看起来没有魔法，但经过仔细研究10分钟并成功通过DC 25的智力（奥术）检定后，可以识别出它的真实面目。摧毁魂器的条件之一是恢复雕像的头部，无论是重新连接原始头部还是构建一个足够的替代品（例如使用{@spell stone shape}）。",

	"Ideally, an {@creature ascetic of Vecna|LM} never has to fight at all—it typically remains locked away in a meditation chamber hidden away from prying eyes, using Dream Stride to direct its underlings' activities and to destroy any possible threats as soon as possible.

	"In combat, the ascetic will focus on the melee threats while its minions try to attack any ranged attackers from behind; it uses Crushing Bludgeon and {@spell telekinesis} to interfere with their movements, and it assaults them with Mind Cannon knowing that their mental defenses are probably weak. Ideally catching at least two opponents in the area, it uses Creeping Rot when possible to drain their hit points over time.": "在战斗中，苦行者将专注于近战威胁，而其手下会试图从背后攻击任何远程攻击者；它使用Crushing Bludgeon和{@spell telekinesis}干扰他们的移动，并利用Mind Cannon攻击他们，因为它知道他们的精神防御可能较弱。在理想情况下至少能够困住两个对手，它会在可能的情况下使用Creeping Rot逐渐消耗他们的生命值。",
	"Just before ascending to godhood, the demon lord Orcus was murdered.

	"Orcus is a massive, bloated demon prince—bloated on spite, bile, and contempt.

	"Tenebrous sought the {@i Wand of Orcus} so that he may resurrect as a true deity, wandering the planes and slaying other gods along the way using an ancient power known as the Last Word.

	"Tenebrous prefers spending his legendary actions on {@spell eyebite} and {@spell telekinesis}, inflicting conditions that prevent the party from pursuing him as he teleports away. Tenebrous knows that combat is a game of attrition, and is not afraid of dragging out the fight if it means ensuring victory. The party's best chance of defeating Tenebrous is to lay a trap or to otherwise force a particular choice of arena that leaves Tenebrous exposed with few hiding spots.": "Tenebrous（暗影）更喜欢将他的传奇行动用于{@spell eyebite}和{@spell telekinesis}，施加条件以阻止队伍追击他，然后他会传送离开。Tenebrous知道战斗是一场消耗战，如果这意味着确保胜利，他不怕拖延战斗。队伍击败Tenebrous的最佳机会是设置陷阱，或者以其他方式迫使特定的战斗场地选择，让Tenebrous暴露在少数藏身之处的地方。",

	"With both mythic traits active, Vecna can rely on his Discorporation to survive and simply take revenge against the party another day; if the party has completed one of the quests that would enable his demise, he may choose to use {@spell wish} to teleport somewhere else using {@spell plane shift}. If he must fight to the death, he uses all of the tools at his disposal, including the use of Undying Grasp to teleport the party into a small area that he can barrage with Necrotic Web.": "当Vecna的两个神话特质都激活时，他可以依靠他的解体来存活，并简单地在另一天对该队伍进行复仇；如果队伍已经完成了能够导致他灭亡的任务之一，他可以选择使用{@spell wish}来使用{@spell plane shift}传送到其他地方。如果他必须战斗到死，他会利用手中所有的工具，包括使用不朽之握将队伍传送到一个小区域，然后用死灵蛛网进行轰炸。",
	"While killing the god of evil secrets is a nigh impossible task, here are some sample quests that would enable his demise.": "虽然杀死邪恶秘密之神是一项几乎不可能的任务，但以下是一些样本任务，可以让他灭亡。",
	"The {@item Hand of Vecna} and {@item Eye of Vecna} must be found and destroyed. For example, the {@i Hand} may be in the possession of {@creature Arkhan the Cruel|DMG}, the champion of Tiamat.": "必须找到并摧毁{@item Hand of Vecna}和{@item Eye of Vecna}。例如，{@i Hand}可能在提马特的冠军{@creature Arkhan the Cruel|DMG}手中。",
	"{@creature Osterneth|LM}, the bronze lich, must be found and destroyed, and Vecna's heart must be recovered from her body and then also destroyed.": "{@creature Osterneth|LM}，青铜巫妖，必须被找到并摧毁，Vecna的心脏必须从她的身体中取出，然后也被摧毁。",
	"The {@item sword of Kas}, the ancient weapon of Vecna's treacherous former lieutenant, must be used to fight or kill Vecna.": "{@item sword of Kas}，维克纳的背叛前副手的古老武器，必须被用来对抗或杀死维克纳。",
	"Divination spells cast within the lair by creatures other than Vecna have a 75 percent chance to provide misleading results, as determined by the DM. If a divination spell already has a chance to fail or become unreliable when cast multiple times, that chance becomes a guarantee.": "在巢穴内由维克纳以外的生物施放的占卜法术有75%的几率提供误导性结果，由DM决定。如果一个占卜法术在多次施放时已经有失败或变得不可靠的几率，那么这个几率将变成一个保证。",
	"Enigmas of Vecna are the shells of petitioners who have angered Vecna by sharing secrets or otherwise failing their secretive god. These strange humanoids use arcane magic to harry Vecna's enemies from afar. When injured, an enigma of Vecna transforms into a shrieking, clawed berserker.": "维克纳之谜是那些因分享秘密或其他方式惹怒维克纳而被惩罚的请愿者的外壳。这些奇怪的人形生物使用奥术魔法远程骚扰维克纳的敌人。受伤时，维克纳之谜会变身为尖叫着、爪子挥舞的狂战士。",
	"In its normal form, an enigma of Vecna is a bald human with vague features. Enigmas usually wear simple robes, and each carries a dagger. Once bloodied, they undergo a horrific transformation. They sprout long claws, and reveal a fanged, twisted vistage as their skin falls away, leaving behind a flayed form.": "在其正常形态下，维克纳之谜(enigma of Vecna)是一个头发稀疏、模糊特征的秃头人类。之谜通常穿着简单的长袍，每个都携带一把匕首。一旦受伤，它们会经历一次可怕的转变。它们长出长爪，露出一个长着尖牙、扭曲面容的模样，皮肤脱落后留下一个剥皮的形态。",
	"Enigmas are found guarding places sacred to Vecna. They also travel with his honored servants, acting as bodyguards. They have the ability to shock an enemy and leave them shaken up.": "谜题守护着对(`Vecna`)而言神圣的地方。它们也会随着(`Vecna`)的尊贵仆人一同行动，充当护卫。它们拥有能够震慑敌人并使其感到震惊的能力。",
	"Enigmas are actually horrid fiends bound in human form. If pressed in battle, they transform into shrieking, clawed berserkers.": "谜题实际上是被束缚在人类形态中的可怕恶魔。如果在战斗中受到压力，它们会变身为尖叫着、爪子挥舞的狂战士。",
	"In its initial form, {@creature enigma of Vecna|LM|enigmas} keep away from the fray, using Shock Bolt and Memory Ripper to wear down foes.": "在最初形态中，{@creature enigma of Vecna|LM|enigmas}远离混战，使用Shock Bolt和Memory Ripper来削弱敌人。",
	"Once a bloodied enigma completes its gruesome transformation, it leaps forward and engages the enemy in melee, the terrible display of its Horrific Visage causing enemies to recoil before the enigma uses its long, sharp claws to rend their flesh.": "一旦一个血腥的谜团完成了它可怕的变形，它会向前跃进，与敌人在近战中交战，它可怕的面容使敌人退缩，然后使用它长而锋利的爪子撕裂他们的肉。",
	"The world knows paladins to be shining paragons who champion lofty ideals such as compassion, nobility, sacrifice, and valor. Such virtuous figures are symbols to the common people, icons from which they draw the strength and courage to stand fast against the encroaching darkness. Yet in every light a shadow lurks—the brightness of these noble warriors is equaled by the shadow spreading from their sinister counterparts, the {@class blackguard|LM|blackguards}.": "世人皆知圣骑士是闪耀的典范，捍卫着高尚理念，如同怜悯、高贵、牺牲和勇气。这样的美德人物是普通民众的象征，是他们汲取力量和勇气的源泉，以抵御逼近的黑暗。然而，在每一道光芒中都隐藏着阴影——这些高贵战士的光辉被他们邪恶对立者，{@class blackguard|LM|blackguards}，所匹敌。",
	"Each class offers a character-defining choice at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level that unlocks a series of special features, not available to the class as a whole. That choice is called a subclass. Each class has a collective term that describes its subclasses; in the fighter, for instance, the subclasses are called martial archetypes, and in the warlock, they're otherworldly patrons. This chapter provides a selection of five subclasses, as well as some advice for including them in your campaign world.": "每个职业在1级、2级或3级提供一个定义角色的选择，解锁一系列特殊功能，这些功能对整个职业来说是不可用的。这个选择被称为子职业。每个职业都有一个总称来描述它的子职业；例如，在战士中，子职业被称为武术原型，而在术士中，它们被称为异界主宰。本章提供了五个子职业的选择，以及一些建议如何将它们包含在你的战役世界中。",
	"This section describes the design process that went into these subclasses, and is directed towards DMs that are considering them for their games.": "这一部分描述了用于这些子职业的设计过程，面向考虑在他们的游戏中使用这些子职业的DMs。",
	"The subclasses included relate to the themes of death, darkness, undeath, and negative energy, whether they harness these powers directly or instead choose to combat them. In a game world, these archetypes can be used by player characters and NPCs alike. For instance, a powerful guardian that serves the lich or vampire that the party is facing might have features from or reminiscent of the Death's Chosen archetype, while a Circle of Twilight druids might be a key faction or location involved in your campaign's story. Feel free to take inspiration from the flavor text for these subclasses when creating adventures, factions, NPCs, and other elements of your campaign, especially when one or more of them are being used by the characters in your party.": "这些子职业与死亡、黑暗、不死和负能量的主题相关，无论是直接利用这些力量还是选择与之作战。在游戏世界中，玩家角色和NPC都可以使用这些原型。例如，一位强大的守护者可能效忠于队伍正在面对的巫妖或吸血鬼，可能具有或类似于“死亡之选”子职业的特征，而暮光之环德鲁伊可能是你战役故事中的一个关键派系或地点。在创作冒险、派系、NPC和其他战役元素时，可以从这些子职业的口味文本中获得灵感，尤其是当角色中的一个或多个正在使用这些子职业时。",
	"The \"Creating New Character Options\" section in Chapter 9 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} provides advice for making or modifying races, classes, and subclasses. In particular, the \"Creating New Class Options\" subsection describes how a subclass you make is allowed to have similar features or feature overlap with existing options, and that you may wish to find existing features that can be used as models for new ones. This design process helps ensure that the options created are balanced (since the features or mechanics they use have already been playtested), while also preventing the need to \"reinvent the wheel\" by creating similar features that from scratch.": "{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中第9章的“创建新角色选项”部分提供了有关制作或修改种族、职业和子职业的建议。特别是，“创建新职业选项”小节描述了您制作的子职业可以具有与现有选项类似的特征或特征重叠，并且您可能希望找到可用作新特征模型的现有特征。这种设计过程有助于确保所创建的选项是平衡的（因为它们使用的特征或机制已经经过了测试），同时也避免了需要通过从头开始创建类似特征的需要。",
	"Following this advice, many of the subclasses below use, reflavor, or transform features from existing subclasses into new ones, or otherwise model their mechanics off of such features. For instance, the Death's Chosen martial archetype includes a power progression akin to that of the Psi Warrior archetype. Meanwhile, the Circle of Twilight is built off of the {@i Unearthed Arcana} subclass of the same name, but includes a few fixes and changes that make it feel more balanced and polished.": "遵循这些建议，下面许多子职业使用、重新塑造或转化现有子职业的特性为新的子职业，或者以这些特性为模板塑造他们的机制。例如，死亡之选武学流派包含了类似于灵能战士职业的能力进展。与此同时，暮光之环是建立在同名职业的{@i Unearthed Arcana}子职业基础上的，但包含了一些修正和变化，使其感觉更加平衡和精致。",
	"The table below summarizes each of the subclasses presented in this section.": "下表总结了本节中介绍的每个子类。",

	"Druid": "德鲁伊 (Druid)",
	"Protects the natural order of life and death": "保护生死自然秩序",
	"This chapter describes a variety of mundane, alchemical, and magic items that might be common in campaigns that prominently feature undead. Some function as weapons against the walking dead, while others serve the cause of undeath itself.": "本章描述了各种在以不死生物为主题的战役中可能常见的日常用品、炼金术品和魔法物品。有些可以作为对抗行尸的武器，而另一些则为不死生物的事业提供帮助。",
	"Any world that includes a significant number of undead can be expected to develop a wide range of new magic items designed to interact with those creatures. Some are intended for combat, while others are more utilitarian in nature.": "任何包含大量不死生物的世界都可以预期会发展出各种新的魔法物品，旨在与这些生物互动。有些是用于战斗，而另一些则更具实用性质。",
	"Made by the living, some magical armor is used to provide crucial defense against the attacks of undead creatures. However, necromancy magic can also be used to extract necromantic residues from undead creatures to craft undead armor. Despite its name, undead armor can be used by any creature that has the appropriate proficiencies.": "由生者制作，一些魔法盔甲被用来提供对不死生物攻击的关键防御。然而，死灵魔法也可以用来从不死生物身上提取死灵残留物，用于制作不死盔甲。尽管名字上是不死盔甲，但任何具有适当熟练技能的生物都可以使用。",
	"Some of the special weapons here are intended for the weapons of characters who fight undead, while others work best for weapons in the hands of the undead themselves.": "这里的一些特殊武器是为那些与不死生物战斗的角色设计的，而另一些则最适合不死生物自己手中的武器。",
	"Magic rods contain unique effects and abilities. Some function as weapons, while others have no combat abilities beyond their magical properties. The four rods described here might all be found in a campaign that features undead.": "魔杖包含独特的效果和能力。有些可作为武器使用，而另一些除了其魔法属性外没有战斗能力。在一个以不死生物为特色的冒险中，可能会发现下面描述的四根魔杖。",
	"Each sentient artifact is part of a larger story, a slice of the world's history. An artifact's back story might be glorious or ignominious, uplifting or disheartening, portentous or rooted firmly in the past. Artifacts associated with death and the undying are just as common as any other kind.": "每个有灵性的神器都是更大故事的一部分，是世界历史的一部分。 一个神器的背景故事可能是光荣的或可耻的，振奋人心的或令人沮丧的，重要的或牢牢扎根于过去。 与死亡和不朽有关的神器和其他任何类型一样普遍。",
	"The assortment of miscellaneous items here runs the gamut of utility, from offensive tools to defensive protections to the purely utilitarian.": "这里的各种杂项物品涵盖了各种用途，从攻击工具到防御保护再到纯粹实用的物品。",
	"Undead grafts are formed of nonliving flesh attached to a still-living body, the results of vile experimentation by living necromancers and death priests seeking to become more like what they revere while remaining on this side of death.": "不死移植物是由连接到仍然活着的身体上的非生物组织形成的，这是活着的死灵术士和死亡祭司进行邪恶实验的结果，他们试图变得更像他们所崇拜的东西，同时仍然停留在生死界限的这一侧。",
	"Undead grafts follow the rules for magic items described in the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}. To attune to an undead graft, you must remove an appropriate body part and replace it with the graft. For example, if the graft is a hand, you must lop off one of your hands at the wrist and the press the graft against the stump; if the graft is an eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the graft into the empty socket. Once you have attuned to it, the graft becomes a functional replacement of the removed body part. If the graft is ever removed, your attunement to it immediately ends.": "不死移植物遵循{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}中描述的魔法物品规则。要调谐不死移植物，您必须移除一个适当的身体部位，并用移植物替换它。例如，如果移植物是一只手，您必须在手腕处砍掉一只手，然后将移植物按在断肢上；如果移植物是一只眼睛，您必须剜出自己的眼睛，然后将移植物按在空眼眶中。一旦您调谐成功，移植物就成为替代被移除身体部位的功能性替代品。如果移植物被移除，您对它的调谐立即结束。",
	"The nonmagical items in this section are particularly suited for characters who deal with undead on a regular basis (either as enemies or allies).": "本节中的非魔法物品特别适合那些经常与不死生物打交道的角色（无论是作为敌人还是盟友）。（undead）",
	"This section lists useful substances that interact with or otherwise involve undeath and undead creatures.": "这一部分列出了与不死生物和亡灵有关的有用物质。",
	"While magic is often wielded during battles between the living and the dead, there is a variety of mundane equipment that can be used as well. Such equipment typically involves the use of holy water (or unholy water), or otherwise takes advantage of certain properties that undead are vulnerable to.": "在生者和死者之间的战斗中，通常会使用魔法，但也有各种日常装备可以使用。这些装备通常涉及使用圣水（或邪水），或者利用不死生物容易受到影响的某些属性。",
	"This chapter presents an array of spells designed for use by characters and monsters alike. Some are used by those who would control or serve undead, others are used to oppose undead, and others are simply used by undead creatures themselves.": "本章介绍了一系列法术，旨在供角色和怪物使用。 有些是供那些想要控制或服务不死生物的人使用，另一些是用来对抗不死生物的，还有一些只是由不死生物自己使用的。",
	"Before diving into the spell descriptions, this section primes DMs for the use of these spells in their games.": "在深入了解咒语描述之前，这一部分为DMs在游戏中使用这些咒语做好了准备。",
	"These spells are all meant for player use. For each one, the classes that can access them were handpicked based on class balance and whether or not they would be appropriate for that class's theme. For instance, spells that channel positive energy are typically excluded from the wizard spell list, while powerful spells of 5th level or lower that would be overbearing or overpowered if spammed many times per day are excluded from the warlock spell list.": "这些法术都是供玩家使用的。对于每一个法术，可以访问它们的职业都是根据职业平衡和是否适合该职业主题而精心挑选的。例如，通常会将调用正能量的法术排除在巫师法术清单之外，而那些如果每天多次使用会过于强大或过于压倒性的5级或更低级别的强力法术则被排除在术士法术清单之外。",
	"However, many of these spells work well in the hands of NPCs too, and may even function better when used by them. For example, {@spell ghoul light|LM} might be used throughout a lich's lair to prevent clerics from turning all of their minions, while {@spell field of ghouls|LM} can be used by enemy spellcasters to create hordes of unliving monsters for the party to fight. Some spells, such as {@i animate crawling claw|LM}, {@spell ghoul gauntlet|LM}, {@spell necrotic cyst|LM}, and {@spell plague of undead|LM}, can have a significant impact on the narrative by justifying the existence of certain monsters or by being a story element for the party to experience and deal with.": "然而，许多这些法术在NPC手中也能发挥很好的作用，甚至在他们使用时可能效果更好。例如，{@spell ghoul light|LM} 可能会被用在巫妖的巢穴中，防止牧师们转化他们所有的追随者，而{@spell field of ghouls|LM} 可以被敌对法师使用，创造大量不死怪物供队伍对抗。一些法术，比如{@i animate crawling claw|LM}、{@spell ghoul gauntlet|LM}、{@spell necrotic cyst|LM}和{@spell plague of undead|LM}，可以通过证明某些怪物的存在或成为队伍体验和处理的故事元素，对叙事产生重大影响。",
	"The next section contains new spells that the DM may add to a campaign, making them available to player character and monster spellcasters alike. The Summary of Spells table below lists the new spells presented in this chapter, ordering them by level. The table also notes the school of magic of a spell, whether it requires concentration, whether it bears the ritual tag, and which classes have access to it.": "下一部分包含了DM可以添加到战役中的新咒语，使它们对玩家角色和怪物施法者都可用。下面的咒语摘要表列出了本章介绍的新咒语，按等级排序。表格还注明了咒语的魔法学派、是否需要集中、是否带有仪式标签以及哪些职业可以使用它。",
