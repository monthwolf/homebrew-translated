	"The massive half-orc let out a blood- curdling battle cry as he leaped from the roof onto the back of the gargantuan blue dragon. As the great foe flew into the sky, he gripped the dragon's spines with a near- supernatural level of strength. No matter how much it twisted and turned, the dragon could not shake the warrior from his back. As the monster tired, the half-orc drew his greatsword and plunged it into the neck of the beast. After the dust cleared, the warrior emerged victorious from the crumpled heap of blue scales that had once terrorized the kingdom.": "巨大的半兽人发出了令人血脉喷张的战吼，他从屋顶跳到了巨大的蓝龙的背上。当这个伟大的敌人飞向天空时，他用一种近乎超自然的力量抓住了龙的脊柱。无论它如何扭动，龙都无法从他的背上甩掉战士。当怪物疲惫不堪时，半兽人拔出他的大剑，将它插入野兽的脖子。尘埃落定后，战士从那堆皱巴巴的蓝色鳞片中胜利地走了出来，它曾经让这个王国感到恐惧。",
	"As the goblins began to come over the ramparts, the young warrior emptied her mind and gave herself over to the bloodlust of battle. Her massive axe severed the head of the first goblin to climb the wall, and before its head hit the ground she had another goblin by the throat. As her foe begged for his puny life she let out a guttural roar and threw him from the top of the walls. Minutes later, she would come to her senses surrounded by the fallen bodies of those who had dared to assault the citadel of her ancestors.": "当地精开始越过城墙时，这位年轻的战士清空了她的思想，把自己交给了嗜血的战斗。她的巨斧砍掉了第一个爬上城墙的地精的头，在它的头落地之前，她又掐住了另一个地精的喉咙。当她的敌人乞求他那微不足道的生命时，她发出一声阴森的怒吼，把他从墙顶上扔了下去。几分钟后，她清醒过来，周围是那些敢于袭击她祖先的城堡的人的倒下的尸体。",
	"A rag-tag group of adventurers fled the collapsing tomb, a hulking white dragonborn leading the way. He could see the exit ahead, but his instincts told him that he was the only one fast enough to make it out before the roof caved in. Drawing upon the ancestral draconic fury in his blood, he shouldered the stone mantle of the doorway. When his final companion made it safely through, he let out a roar of triumph and the weight of the entire front wall of the temple fell behind him.": "一群衣衫褴褛的冒险者逃离了坍塌的坟墓，一个巨大的白龙人在前面带路。他能看到前面的出口，但他的直觉告诉他，他是唯一一个在屋顶塌陷之前就能快速离开的人。他利用血液中祖传的龙族怒火，扛起了门口的石幔。当他的最后一个同伴安全通过时，他发出了胜利的吼声，整个寺庙前墙的重量在他身后落下。",
	"The three characters described above are examples of the primal warriors known as barbarians. Drawing upon primal instinct and the fury of their Rage, they become unstoppable forces of destruction when they take to the battlefield.": "上面描述的三个人物是被称为野蛮人的原始战士的例子。他们利用原始的本能和愤怒，在走上战场时成为不可阻挡的破坏力量。",
	"Not all warriors learn to fight from expert soldiers or formal schools of war. Those known as barbarians are born with a lust for battle in their blood. They are able to wield weapons of war with deadly force based on pure instinct. What they lack in technique, these wild warriors make up for with pure brute force. Like an animal backed into a corner, a barbarian will fight with near-supernatural strength and ferocity.": "并非所有的战士都是从专业的士兵或正规的战争学校学习战斗的。那些被称为野蛮人的人，在他们的血液中天生就有对战斗的渴望。他们能够根据纯粹的本能，以致命的力量挥舞战争武器。他们在技术上的不足，这些野蛮的战士用纯粹的蛮力来弥补。就像一只被逼到墙角的动物，野蛮人会以近乎超自然的力量和凶猛来战斗。",
	"The source of every barbarian's prowess in battle is the white hot Rage deep within their soul. How this Rage manifests is different for each primal warrior. For some barbarians, it is an irresistible lust for blood that only subsides when each of their foes lays slain at their feet. For others, their Rage is an emotionless trance that allows them to ignore any emotions, loyalties, or injuries that would interfere with their fight.": "每个野蛮人的战斗力的来源是他们灵魂深处的白热化愤怒。这种愤怒的表现方式对每个原始战士来说都是不同的。对一些野蛮人来说，它是一种不可抗拒的血腥欲望，只有当他们的每一个敌人躺在他们的脚下时才会消退。对其他人来说，他们的愤怒是一种无感情的恍惚，使他们能够忽略任何会干扰他们战斗的情感、忠诚或伤害。",
	"No matter how this primal Rage manifests itself, it grants all barbarians near-supernatural levels of might and allows them to shrug off blows that would fell a lesser warrior. The wild fury of Rage drives a barbarian to be the first to engage their foe, no matter how deadly. Many barbarians spend their lives seeking ever-greater foes to test the limits of their Rage, only satisfied when facing one who can match their strength.": "无论这种原始的愤怒是如何表现出来的，它都赋予了所有野蛮人近乎超自然的力量，并使他们能够甩掉那些会让小战士倒下的打击。愤怒的狂暴驱使野蛮人成为第一个与敌人交战的人，无论多么致命。许多野蛮人一生都在寻找更强大的敌人来测试他们的愤怒极限，只有在面对一个能与他们的力量相匹配的人时才会感到满意。",
	"When creating a barbarian, the most important thing for you to consider is how they first awakened their Rage. Did a lust for blood overtake you when your farm village was raided by bandits? Is your Rage fueled by a burning desire for revenge against a monster that killed someone you loved? Or, is your Rage a desire for someone who can match your strength?": "当创建一个野蛮人时，你要考虑的最重要的事情是他们最初是如何唤醒他们的愤怒的。当你的农庄被强盗袭击时，对血的欲望是否占据了你？你的 \"愤怒 \"是由对杀死你所爱的人的怪物进行报复的强烈愿望所激发的吗？或者，你的 \"愤怒 \"是对能够与你的力量相匹配的人的渴望？",
	"Also, consider how your barbarian's Rage manifests itself in battle. Is it a frothing bestial fury that causes you to lose your sense of self? Is it an ancient trance passed down from the elders of your tribe so that you may defend your people? Or, does it manifest as a supernatural instinct in battle that allows you to predict the weak points of your enemies and shrug off deadly blows that would slay any other mortal?": "另外，考虑你的野蛮人的愤怒在战斗中是如何表现的。它是一种使你失去自我意识的兽性狂暴吗？它是一种古老的恍惚，从你部落的长老那里流传下来，以便你可以保护你的人民？或者，它在战斗中表现为一种超自然的本能，使你能够预测敌人的弱点，并甩掉会杀死任何其他凡人的致命一击？",

	"You can throw aside concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. Starting at 2nd level, when you make an attack on your turn, you can choose to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee or thrown weapon attack rolls that use Strength for the rest of the turn, but until the start of your next turn, all attack rolls targeting you have advantage.": "你可以抛开对防御的关注，以激烈的拼命方式进行攻击。从2级开始，当你在自己的回合中进行攻击时，你可以选择不顾一切地攻击。这样做会使你在该回合剩余时间内使用力量的近战或投掷武器攻击卷轴上获得优势，但直到你下一回合开始，所有针对你的攻击卷轴都有优势。",
	"Also at 2nd level, your lust for battle unlocks savage abilities that enhance your martial skill, both on and off the battlefield.": "同样在2级的时候，你对战斗的渴望可以解锁野蛮的能力，增强你在战场内外的武术技能。",
	"The Barbarian table shows how many Exploit Dice you have to perform any {@filter Savage Exploits|optionalfeatures|feature type=se} you know. To use one of these Exploits, you must expend one of your Exploit Dice. You can only use one Exploit per attack, ability check, or saving throw you make. You regain all of your expended Exploit Dice each time you finish a short or long rest.": "野蛮人表显示了你有多少个剥削骰子来执行你知道的任何（%0%）。要使用其中的一个漏洞，你必须消耗你的一个漏洞骰子。你每次攻击、能力检定或蓄力投掷只能使用一个漏洞。每次你完成短时或长时休息时，你都会重新获得你所有消耗的探索骰子。",
