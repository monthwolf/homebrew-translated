	"A graying gnome hunched over his workbench, carefully adjusting the clockwork mechanism that would power his creation. Before him laid an automaton of intricate iron gears within a suit of plate armor, built to resemble a large gnome. As the tiny inventor affixed his signature mithril mustache to the face plate, a jolt of electric-blue magic flashed from the automaton. With a sharp motion, the Steel Defender sat upright and awaited the first command of its creator.": "一个头发花白的侏儒弯腰在他的工作台前，小心地调整着会驱动他创造物的发条机械。在他面前摆放着一个由精巧铁制齿轮构成的自动人偶，穿着一套铁甲，造型酷似一个巨大的侏儒。当这位微小的发明家将他标志性的秘银胡须固定在面甲上时，一道电蓝色的魔法闪过自动人偶。随着一个犀利的动作，钢铁卫士坐直了，等待着它的创造者的第一个命令。",
	"The goblin delicately made his way down the tunnel that he had booby-trapped with vials of noxious fumes and acids. This was the third time this year his clan had moved burrows to avoid being raided by adventuring parties, and the inventive goblin was determined to protect the newest home burrow. He was confident that this time he would stop the adventurers that always seemed to find their way to his home.": "哥布林小心翼翼地沿着他用有毒烟雾和酸液装置陷阱的隧道前行。这已经是他的部落今年第三次搬迁地洞，以避免被冒险队抢劫，这位富有创造力的哥布林决心保护最新的家园地洞。他相信这一次他会阻止那些总是找到他家的冒险者。",
	"A young human woman, wearing a leather apron over her fine clothes, flexed the steel gauntlet she had just enchanted. As she closed her fist the gauntlet let forth a blinding arc of lavender lightning, destroying the table on the opposite side of the room. As the dust settled, she affixed the gauntlet to her now complete suit of Arcane Armor. When she revealed this, her latest creation, to her father, he would have no choice but to finally show her his approval.": "一位年轻的人类女性，身穿精美衣服，外面披着皮围裙，她展示了刚刚附魔过的钢铁护手。当她握紧拳头时，护手释放出一道耀眼的薰衣草色闪电，摧毁了房间对面的桌子。尘埃落定后，她将护手固定在她已经完整的奥术盔甲上。当她向父亲展示这件最新的作品时，他终将不得不表现出对她的认可。",
	"Relentless in their pursuit of innovation, artificers are defined by their insatiable curiosity and willingness to push the limits of arcane invention, even at great risk to themselves. For most artificers, they stake their personal value on the fruits of their experimentation, and they see mastering the basics of their chosen craft as the first step toward true greatness.": "在追求创新方面毫不妥协，制造师们以他们无尽的好奇心和愿意冒险推动奥术发明的极限而著称。对于大多数制造师来说，他们把个人价值寄托在他们实验的成果上，他们认为掌握所选择工艺的基础是通往真正伟大的第一步。",
	"Deep down, the goal of every artificer is the discovery of a new groundbreaking invention, magical or otherwise. Some artificers are engineers, students of science and warfare, who bring their considerable intellect to bear to construct deadly weapons augmented with magic. Others view themselves as artists, combining the rigid formulas of arcane magic with the artisanal touch of their own specialized tools and spells.": "每位制造者的内心深处，目标都是发现一项新的开创性发明，无论是魔法还是其他。有些制造者是工程师，是科学和战争的学生，他们运用自己丰富的智慧来构建用魔法增强的致命武器。另一些人将自己视为艺术家，将奥术魔法的严格公式与自己专业工具和法术的工匠之感相结合。",
	"Almost every artificer has a rival, most often another artificer who they seek to outdo at every turn. These intense rivalries are the sole motivation of some artificers, and outdoing their rival is more valuable than any fame or riches they could gain from their discoveries. Many are willing to risk everything they have to achieve a new breakthrough before their rival.": "几乎每个工匠都有一个对手，往往是另一个工匠，他们努力在每一个转折点超越对方。这种激烈的竞争是一些工匠的唯一动力，超越对手比他们从发现中获得的任何名声或财富更有价值。许多人愿意冒一切去在对手之前取得新突破。",
	"By the same token, artificers with similar philosophies and aims often band together in loose artisan's guilds. They share insights and discoveries, hoping to keep ahead of rival guilds by pooling resources and working as a team. However, even when working together, most artificers are protective of any insights they think could lead to a groundbreaking discovery.": "同样地，持有相似理念和目标的铸师们经常会结成松散的工匠行会。他们分享见解和发现，希望通过集中资源和团队合作来保持领先于竞争对手的位置。然而，即使在一起工作时，大多数铸师们也会保护他们认为可能导致突破性发现的任何见解。",
	"When creating an artificer, think about their background and drive for adventure. Who is their rival and what event started their feud? What is your artificer's relationship with the artisan who taught them the basics of their craft? Are they part of a guild? What role do artificers play in the campaign world? Do artificer guilds exist in all the major cities or are you the first person to pursue the path of arcane invention?": "在创建一名铸师时，要考虑他们的背景和对冒险的动力。他们的对手是谁，是什么事件开始了他们的仇恨？你的铸师与教授他们基本工艺的工匠有什么关系？他们是否属于某个行会？铸师在战役世界中扮演什么角色？所有主要城市中是否存在铸师行会，或者你是第一个追求奥术发明之路的人？",
	"Most importantly, what does your artifice look like? Not all arcane inventors work with gears and grease. Is your artificer the student of a hag who uses weird magick to imbue totems of bone with arcane energy? Or, are you an enchanter who carves elvish runes into elaborate wooden wands and staffs?": "最重要的是，你的(`artifice`)是什么样子的？并不是所有的奥术发明者都使用齿轮和润滑油。你的(`artificer`)是一个学习巫婆使用奇异魔法将骨头图腾注入奥术能量的学生吗？或者，你是一个雕刻着精致的精灵符文在木制法杖和长棍上的附魔师吗？",
	"You can make a Artificer quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the {@background guild artisan|phb|artisan} background. Third, choose the {@optfeature enhanced defense|LLAART} and {@optfeature repeating shot|LLAART} infusions.": "您可以通过以下建议快速创建一名神器师。首先，将智力设为最高能力值，其次是敏捷。其次，选择{@background guild artisan|phb|artisan}背景。第三，选择{@optfeature enhanced defense|LLAART}和{@optfeature repeating shot|LLAART}的灌输。",

	"At the end of a long rest, you can use your tinker's tools to imbue an Infusion you know into a nonmagical object. To do so, you must be able to touch the object with your tools.": "在一次长休结束时，你可以使用你的工匠工具将你所知道的一种（Infusion）灌注到一个非魔法物品中。要做到这一点，你必须能够用你的工具触碰这个物品。",
	"If the Infusion requires attunement, you can attune to the object the instant you infuse it, or you can forgo attunement so another creature can attune to it. To attune to the infused item later, you must follow the normal attunement process.": "如果该灌注物品需要认定，你可以在灌注时立即认定该物品，或者你可以放弃认定，以便另一个生物可以认定它。要稍后认定灌注的物品，你必须遵循正常的认定流程。",
	"The Infusion remains in an item indefinitely. If you die, the Infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). Infusions vanish immediately if you give up your knowledge of one to learn another or imbue the Infusion into another object.": "灌注物品会永久存在。如果你死亡，那么在过去的天数等于你的智力修正值的天数之后（最少1天），灌注会消失。如果你放弃某个灌注的知识以学习另一个，或者将灌注注入另一个物品，灌注会立即消失。",
	"You can infuse multiple objects at the end of each long rest, up to one for each Infusion you know. Each Infusion can be in only one object at a time, and no object can bear more than one Infusion. If you transfer an Infusion to a new object, any previous instance of that Infusion immediately ends.": "你可以在每次长休结束时给多个物品灌注能量，每次最多一个对应你所掌握的每个（Infusion）(%num%)。每个（Infusion）(%num%)一次只能在一个物品上，而且一个物品不能承载多个（Infusion）(%num%)。如果你将（Infusion）(%num%)转移到一个新物品上，之前的（Infusion）(%num%)立即结束。",
	"You can also use your Infusions to replicate magic items that you have studied. Over the course of a long rest, you can use tinker's tools to examine a magic item you can touch. At the end of that long rest, you can replace one of your Infusions Known with the knowledge of this magic item. After which, you can infuse an object with the properties of that magic item, following all the rules for your other Infusions.": "你也可以利用你的灌注来复制你研究过的魔法物品。在一次长休的过程中，你可以使用工匠工具来检查一个你能触摸到的魔法物品。在那次长休结束时，你可以用这个魔法物品的知识来替换你已知的灌注之一。之后，你可以将一个物品灌注上那个魔法物品的属性，遵循所有其他灌注的规则。",
	"You can use this feature to replicate any item of Common rarity. As you gain artificer levels you can use this feature to replicate items of increasing rarity: Uncommon at 5th level, Rare at 11th level, and finally Very Rare items at 17th level.": "你可以使用这个特性来复制任何一件普通稀有度的物品。随着你获得铁匠等级，你可以使用这个特性来复制稀有度逐渐增加的物品：在5级时是不寻常(Uncommon)，在11级时是稀有(Rare)，最后在17级时是非常稀有(Very Rare)的物品。",
	"At 1st level, choose one of the following Specializations that best represents the arcane research and inventions of your artificer: Alchemist, Armorer, Battle Smith, Forgewright, or Wandslinger, each of which is detailed at the end of the class.": "在1级时，选择以下最能代表你工匠的奥术研究和发明的专长之一：炼金术士 (Alchemist)，铠甲师 (Armorer)，战斗铁匠 (Battle Smith)，铸造师 (Forgewright)，或者魔杖使者 (Wandslinger)，每个专长的详细信息在职业末尾有介绍。",

	"At 2nd level, you learn two cantrips of your choice from the {@filter Artificer spell list|spells|class=Alternate Artificer (LLAART)}. You learn an additional Artificer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.": "在2级时，你可以从{@filter Artificer spell list|spells|class=Alternate Artificer (LLAART)}中选择学习两个零度法术。在4级时，你可以学习另一个(%Artificer%)法术，而在10级时可以学习另一个。",
