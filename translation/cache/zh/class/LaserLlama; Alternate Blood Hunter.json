	"As the horde of demonic spawn lurched toward her, the aging half-elf ran her thin blade along her palm, coating it in her blood. In an instant, the blood ignited, wreathing her sword in a ghastly blue flame. She fell upon the horde as a blur of azure fire and cold steel. She would show no mercy to the hellspawn today.": "当一群恶魔的后裔朝她蜿蜒而来时，这位年迈的半精灵沿着自己的手掌划过她瘦削的刀刃，将其浸满了自己的鲜血。转瞬间，鲜血燃烧起来，用一种可怕的蓝色火焰缠绕着她的剑。她如同一团闪烁着蓝色火焰和寒冷钢铁的模糊身影扑向了那群恶魔。今天她不会对地狱的子嗣们留情。",
	"In the light of the pale moon, an almost feral halfling got down on all fours to sniff the tracks before him. The scent of goblin was unmistakable, vile rags and rotten meats.

Those who survive this ancient and deadly ritual are able to wield the signature sanguine magic that marks them as a Blood Hunter.": "血猎人没有正式的等级制度，他们的组织和选择承受的诅咒一样多样化，但他们有一个共同点，那就是猎人的诅咒。那些在这个古老而致命的仪式中幸存下来的人能够驾驭标志性的血色魔法，这让他们成为了一名血猎人。",
	"The makeup of this sinister ritual varies by Order and era, with each incorporating monstrous curses and magic which grant a Blood Hunter the unique abilities of their Order.

	"When creating a Blood Hunter, the most important thing to consider is why they would choose this accursed way of life. Were they the victim of a horrible monster attack and swore vengeance, no matter the personal cost? Were they trained from birth under the tutelage of an elder hunter, and forged into a relentless monster slayer? Or, were they recruited by a secretive society for their exceptional talent at hunting?": "在创建一个血猎时，最重要的考虑因素是他们为什么会选择这种被诅咒的生活方式。他们是不是曾经遭受过可怕的怪物袭击，并发誓要复仇，不惜一切代价？他们是不是从出生起就在一位年长猎人的指导下接受训练，并成为一个无情的怪物杀手？或者，他们是不是因为在狩猎方面的出色才能而被一个秘密社会招募？",
