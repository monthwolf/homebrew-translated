	"A striking tiefling with an auburn complexion and dark horns stood in the center of a ritual circle he scrawled under the light of a full moon. As he chanted in a forgotten tongue, the moon was swallowed by darkness and an otherworldly voice came from beyond the stars. The disembodied voice offered him unspeakable power on the condition that he worked toward the voice's esoteric goals. The tiefling agreed and the light of the moon reappeared as his hands crackled with eldritch energies.": "一个引人注目的提弗林（tiefling）,肤色赤褐，黑色的角站在他在满月的光下划出的仪式圈中心。当他用一种被遗忘的语言吟唱时，月亮被黑暗吞噬，一股来自星辰之外的异世界声音响起。这个无形的声音向他提供了无法言说的力量，条件是他要为这个声音的神秘目标努力。提弗林同意了，月亮的光重新出现，他的手闪耀着奥术能量。",
	"The massive goliath finished carving an eldritch idol from the bones of the ancient creature he had slain. The elder beast had been steeped in the magic of the ancient jungle for years. Its bones would make the perfect vessel for the occult magicks that he had discovered within the temple the beast had guarded.": "这位庞大的巨人完成了从他所杀死的古代生物的骨骼中雕刻出一尊神秘的偶像。这头上古巨兽已经被古老丛林的魔法浸透多年。它的骨骼将成为他在那座巨兽守护的神庙中发现的神秘魔法的完美容器。",
	"As the cultists of a rival demon lord circled around him, the gaunt warrior held out his open hand and conjured a battleaxe made of clear blue ice. Despite his skeletal frame, the warrior moved impossibly fast. Fueled by the frigid magic of a powerful demon lord, he made quick work of his foes. As the cultists lay motionless, the frozen battleaxe melted away.": "当一个敌对恶魔领主的邪教徒们围绕着他时，那个消瘦的战士伸出他的空手，凝聚出一把由清澈蓝冰制成的战斧。尽管他骨瘦如柴，但这个战士移动起来不可思议的快。在一个强大的恶魔领主的冰冷魔法的推动下，他迅速地解决了他的敌人。当那些邪教徒们躺在那里一动不动时，那把冰冷的战斧融化消失了。",
	"The three characters described above are examples of the occult mages known as Warlocks. By gathering dark secrets and sinister magicks these strange scholars open themselves up to bargains with unspeakable beings of immense power.": "上述三个角色是被称为术士的神秘法师的例子。通过收集黑暗秘密和邪恶魔法，这些奇怪的学者们打开了自己与无法言说的强大存在进行交易的大门。",
	"Driven by an irresistible thirst for knowledge, a Warlock will do almost anything to uncover lost bits of lore. Unlike others who practice the arcane arts, Warlocks will make use of any shortcut to power. They are often marked by a strange array of tiny trinkets: small idols, totems, holy symbols, and occult paraphernalia. They use these trinkets to hold fragments of lost, secret, and sinister arcane magicks, often drawing their power from many different occult traditions at once.": "受对知识无法抗拒的渴望驱使，术士将几乎不惜一切去揭示失落的知识碎片。与其他从事奥术艺术的人不同，术士会利用任何捷径来获取力量。他们常常被一系列奇怪的小饰品标记：小偶像、图腾、圣徽和神秘的仪式用品。他们利用这些小饰品来保存失落、秘密和邪恶的奥术魔法碎片，通常同时从许多不同的神秘传统中汲取力量。",
	"To a Warlock, no relic is too sacred, no forbidden text too dangerous, no tomb is too risky to be delved in the pursuit of occult knowledge and the power that comes along with it.": "对于一个术士来说，没有什么遗物是太神圣的，没有什么禁忌的文本是太危险的，没有什么坟墓是太冒险的，以追求神秘知识和随之而来的力量。",
	"The ultimate goal of every single Warlock is the accumulation of personal power. The reason for this pursuit is different for each Warlock: some desire personal wealth and glory, others seek out power to protect others or as a means for good, and still others use their power to exact revenge on their enemies. Eventually, all Warlocks stumble upon or are approached by powerful otherworldly beings drawn to their thirst for power.": "每个术士的终极目标是积累个人力量。这种追求的原因因术士而异：有些人渴望个人财富和荣耀，其他人寻求力量来保护他人或作为善良的手段，还有一些人利用他们的力量向敌人复仇。最终，所有术士都会偶然发现或被强大的异界生物所吸引，这些生物被他们对力量的渴望所吸引。",
	"Though the circumstances of the relationship are as varied as each Warlock's reason for accumulating knowledge, every Warlock will eventually enter into an agreement with such an otherworldly being of immense power. Whether they forge a bargain willingly, trick this powerful entity into lending them its power, or secretly draw their magic from these beings, all Warlocks find themselves part of these dire bargains.": "尽管每位术士积累知识的原因各不相同，导致他们与强大异界存在达成协议的情况也各式各样。无论是他们自愿达成协议，欺骗这个强大实体借给他们力量，还是秘密地从这些存在中汲取魔法，所有术士最终都会发现自己卷入这些可怕的交易中。",
	"When creating a Warlock, the most important thing for you to consider is the motivation for their pursuit of knowledge and power. Are they driven by an insatiable desire to uncover lost secrets? Have they been seduced by a powerful otherworldly entity to serve as their pawn on the material plane? Or, does their quest for power come from a desire to serve others?": "在创建一个术士时，你需要考虑的最重要的事情是他们追求知识和力量的动机。他们是被一种无法满足的渴望揭示失落秘密的欲望驱使吗？还是被一个强大的异界实体诱惑，成为他们在物质位面上的棋子？又或者，他们对力量的追求源于为他人服务的愿望？",
	"Also, consider how your Warlocks's magic manifests itself. Does each one of their spells and Invocations come from a different occult tradition? Do some magics resemble that of Clerics or Paladins, while other spells appear as a Wizard's spells would? Does their power manifest in unsettling ways that make common folk fear for their lives? Or, are their arts indistinguishable from those of more traditional mages?": "另外，考虑你的术士的魔法是如何显现的。他们的每个法术和唤醒是否来自不同的神秘传统？一些魔法是否类似于牧师或圣骑士的魔法，而其他法术是否像巫师的法术一样？他们的力量是否以令普通人害怕生命安危的不安方式显现？或者，他们的艺术是否与更传统的法师们的艺术无法区分？",
	"If your group uses the rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose the Alternate Warlock as one of your classes.": "如果你的团队使用《玩家手册》中的多职业规则，那么如果你选择另类术士(Alternate Warlock)作为你的职业之一，这里有一些你需要知道的信息。",

	"If Warlock isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency with light armor and simple weapons when you take your first level.": "如果术士不是你的初始职业，当你达到第一级时，你会获得轻甲和简单武器的熟练。",
	"If you have a feature from another class that allows you to learn and cast spells, you can use your Pact Magic spell slots to cast spells that you gained through that feature, and you can use those spell slots to cast your Warlock spells.": "如果你有来自另一个职业的特性，允许你学习和施放法术，你可以使用你的契约魔法法术位来施放通过那个特性获得的法术，并且你可以使用这些法术位来施放你的术士法术。",
	"You can make a Warlock quickly by using these suggestions: First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed either by your Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the Charlatan background. Last, take Eyes of the Rune Keeper and Mask of Many faces as starting Eldritch Invocations.": "你可以通过以下建议快速创建一个术士：首先，将智力设为最高的能力值，然后是体质或敏捷。其次，选择骗子(`Charlatan`)背景。最后，选择符文使者之眼(`Eyes of the Rune Keeper`)和多面面具(`Mask of Many Faces`)作为起始奥术附魔。",
	"You have unearthed fragments of dark, forgotten, and arcane power known as {@filter Eldritch Invocations|optionalfeatures|feature type=LL:EInv}, which you have bound to Trinkets so that you may draw on this power. A Trinket is a tiny object reminiscent of the Invocation bound within. If one of your Trinkets is lost or destroyed, it reforms on your person at the end of your next short or long rest.": "你发掘出了被称为{@filter Eldritch Invocations|optionalfeatures|feature type=LL:EInv}的黑暗、被遗忘的神秘力量的碎片，你将它们绑定在小饰品上，以便你能够利用这股力量。饰品是一种微小的物品，让人联想到其中所绑定的召唤。如果你的饰品丢失或被摧毁，它会在你的下一个短休或长休结束时重新出现在你身上。",
	"At 1st level, you have two such Trinkets, and bound within each is one Eldritch Invocation of your choice from the list at the end of this class.

	"You can unleash the power of your Eldritch Invocations as beams of arcane energy. While holding a Trinket containing an Invocation, you can use your action to make a ranged spell attack against a target you can see within 120 feet. On hit, it takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier.": "你可以释放你的奥术附魔的力量，将其化为奥术能量射线。当持有一个包含附魔的小玩意时，你可以使用一个动作对你能看见的目标在120尺内进行远程法术攻击。命中时，目标受到等于1d8 + 你的智力调整值的力量伤害。",

	"The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of 1st through 5th-level.
