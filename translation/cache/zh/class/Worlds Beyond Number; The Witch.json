	"Standing on moss-covered steps in the path of an advancing ogre, a young shrine maiden carefully pours a hot cup of tea. She whispers a word of thanks into the rising steam, and as she raises the drink, the ogre drops the greatclub from his hand as he sits in wonder, gazing at the offering.": "站在长满青苔的台阶上，面对一只前来的食人魔，一位年轻的神龛巫女小心翼翼地倒出一杯热茶。她在升腾的蒸汽中低声道谢，当她举起这杯饮料时，食人魔惊讶地坐下，放下手中的巨棍，凝视着这份供品。",
	"Peering over a bubbling cauldron, a mother watches her child breathe raggedly under a patch-work quilt. A crow alights upon her shoulder with white-blossoming herbs in its beak, and she sighs with relief as she adds them to the magic brew. Striding through the great mead hall, a wizened crone strikes terror into the hearts of once-brave warriors. She points a bony finger at the old king, and as shadow and fire leap to the fury of her cackling command, the king dies knowing he has earned this fate.": "在一个冒着泡泡的大锅边，一位母亲看着她的孩子在一个拼凑而成的被子下急促地呼吸。一只乌鸦停在她的肩膀上，嘴里叼着盛开的白色草药，她松了口气，将它们加入到魔法药汁中。穿过宏伟的酒厅，一位皱纹斑驳的老妇人让曾经勇敢的战士们心生恐惧。她用一根瘦骨嶙峋的手指指向老国王，当阴影和火焰跃动，听到她狂笑的命令时，国王知道自己命中注定。(%Kingdom of (D&D setting)%)",
	"Witches are powerful mages as well as devoted caretakers, combining patience, insight, and subtlety with extraordinary wilfulness. While other spellcasters might use magic in grand gestures that bend the world to their whims, a witch's power works in harmony with the people, plants, animals, and magical forces around them. The practice of witchcraft is often rooted in everyday rituals and chores, emphasizing the value in doing things with care and deliberation rather than taking shortcuts.": "巫师是强大的法师，也是忠诚的护理者，将耐心、洞察力和微妙性与非凡的意志力相结合。虽然其他施法者可能会使用魔法来进行弯曲世界的宏伟姿态，但巫师的力量与他们周围的人、植物、动物和魔法力量和谐共处。巫术的实践通常根植于日常仪式和琐事，强调以细心和审慎的态度做事的价值，而不是走捷径。",
	"Witches are infamous for their curses, but they don't curse others on a whim. A witch's curse is most often a consequence for causing harm or engaging in disrespectful behaviour, to the witch themselves or the people and places under their care. Curses range from a minor, temporary rebuke—causing a bully to startle at their own shadow—to permanent ramifications meted out as justice for wicked acts—transforming a greedy poacher into a helpless deer. If the recipient of the curse demonstrates increased understanding and remorse for their actions, the witch may be persuaded to lift the spell.": "女巫以她们的诅咒而臭名昭著，但她们并不会轻易诅咒他人。女巫的诅咒往往是对那些造成伤害或表现出不尊重行为的人，对女巫自己或她们照顾的人和地方的一种后果。诅咒的程度从轻微、暂时的惩罚—让恶霸在自己的影子中感到惊吓—到作为对邪恶行为的正义惩罚而施加的永久后果—将贪婪的偷猎者变成一只无助的鹿。如果受诅咒者表现出对自己行为的增进理解和悔悟，女巫可能会被说服解除咒语。",
	"A home—both a location and the people who live there—is a foundational part of witchcraft. A witch often serves as a protector, counsellor, and healer to the people (and animals, plants, and Wicked) who live near them, whether or not this role is sanctioned by the local authorities. Often, this spellwork is seamlessly incorporated into simple home goods and handcrafts, familiar gifts that comfort their recipients and lie dormant until needed. While a witch doesn't necessarily stay in one place, they understand the importance of community, and work to preserve balance between people, the natural world, and supernatural forces wherever they go.": "家园——既是一个地点，也是居住在那里的人们——是巫术的基础部分。巫师通常充当着保护者、顾问和治疗者的角色，对居住在他们附近的人们（以及动物、植物和邪恶）提供帮助，无论这种角色是否得到当地当局的认可。通常，这种咒语工作会无缝地融入简单的家居用品和手工艺品中，这些熟悉的礼物能够安慰接受者，并在需要时保持沉寂。虽然巫师不一定会停留在一个地方，但他们理解社区的重要性，并努力在他们所到之处保持人与自然界、超自然力量之间的平衡。",
	"When making a witch, consider your character's relationship to the world and the creatures around them. How closely do they live to the subjects of their care, and what would it take to make your witch break away from them? How did they meet their familiar, and what do they do for each other? What everyday rituals ground them in their work?": "在制作一个女巫角色时，考虑角色与世界和周围生物的关系。他们与自己照顾的对象之间的关系有多密切，以及是什么让你的女巫与它们分道扬镳？他们是如何遇见他们的使者（（familiar）），他们互相为对方做了什么？什么日常仪式让他们在工作中找到平衡？",
	"Perhaps your character is new to witchcraft, or perhaps they spent years as an apprentice learning traditions, rituals, and hexes from their mentor. If your character had a mentor, what was your relationship with that witch, and what lessons did they impart to you beyond the practices of spellcasting and magic?": "也许你的角色是新手巫术者，或者也许他们花了多年时间作为学徒从他们的导师那里学习传统、仪式和咒语。如果你的角色有一个导师，那么你们之间是什么关系？除了咒语施法和魔法实践之外，他们还传授给你哪些教训？",
	"You can make a witch quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the {@spell cackle|WitchWBN}, {@spell guidance}, and {@spell mending} cantrips (the {@spell cackle|WitchWBN} cantrip is included at the end of this class).": "按照以下建议，您可以快速创建一个女巫。首先，智力应该是您最高的能力值，其次是敏捷或体质。其次，选择{@spell cackle|WitchWBN}，{@spell guidance}和{@spell mending}的零度法术（{@spell cackle|WitchWBN}法术将在该职业的最后列出）。",
	"As a custodian of old folkways and the balance between worlds, you can cast witch spells. Your magic works through subtle but emphatic suggestion, channelling your will to influence the wellbeing, fate, or opinions of beings who need a little (or not-so-little) nudge to exist in harmony with others.": "作为古老习俗和世界平衡的守护者，你可以施展女巫咒语。你的魔法通过微妙但坚定的建议发挥作用，引导你的意志影响那些需要一点（或不那么小）推动以与他人和谐共处的生物的幸福、命运或观点。",
	"At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the {@filter witch spell list|spells|class=Witch (WWBN)}. You gain additional witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table.": "在1级时，你可以从{@filter witch spell list|spells|class=Witch (WWBN)}中选择三个你喜欢的零级法术。随着你等级的提升，你将在女巫表中的“已知零级法术”栏中看到你可以选择的额外女巫零级法术。",
	"The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your witch spells of 1st Level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.": "女巫表格显示你有多少法术位来施放你的1级及更高级别的女巫法术。要施放这些法术中的一个，你必须消耗一个等级高于或等级相同的法术位。当你完成一次长休后，你会恢复所有已消耗的法术位。",
	"You prepare the list of witch spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the witch spell list. When you do so, choose a number of witch spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your witch level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.": "你准备了可供你施放的女巫咒语清单，从女巫咒语清单中进行选择。在这样做时，选择与你的智力调整值 + 你的女巫等级相等的女巫咒语数量（最少为一个咒语）。这些咒语必须是你拥有法术位的等级。",
	"For example, if you are a 3rd-level witch, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level Spell Slots. With an Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd Level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell {@spell cure wounds}, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.": "例如，如果你是一名3级的女巫，你有四个1级和两个2级的法术位。拥有16点的智慧，你准备的法术清单可以包括六个1级或2级的法术，任意组合。如果你准备了1级法术{@spell cure wounds}，你可以使用1级或2级位来施放它。施放法术不会将其从你准备的法术清单中移除。",
	"You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of witch spells requires time spent practicing your craft: at least 1 minute per spell Level for each spell on your list.": "你可以在完成一次长休后更改你准备的法术清单。准备新的女巫法术清单需要花费时间练习你的技艺：每个清单上的法术至少需要1分钟。",
	"Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells, as your magic draws upon your profound attunement to the presence of magic in all things. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.": "智慧是你作为女巫的法术的施法能力，因为你的魔法依赖于你对万物中魔法存在的深刻调和。每当一个法术提到你的施法能力时，你就使用你的智慧。此外，当你施放女巫法术并设定豁免 DC 时，以及进行攻击检定时，你也使用你的智慧修正值。",
	"You can cast any witch spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.": "如果你知道任何带有仪式标签的女巫咒语并且你已经准备好了这个咒语，你可以将其作为仪式施放。",
	"You can use an {@item arcane focus|phb} as a spellcasting focus for your witch spells. Witches may also have unusual, homemade, or repurposed objects as their arcane focuses, such as brooms, kitchen knives, kettles, dolls, or similar household objects. To use such an item, you must spend an hour long meditation dedicating it to that purpose.": "你可以使用{@item arcane focus|phb}作为你的(%witch%)法术的施法焦点。女巫们也可以将不寻常的、自制的或重新利用的物品作为他们的奥术焦点，比如扫帚、厨房刀、水壶、玩偶或类似的家庭用品。要使用这样的物品，你必须花一个小时冥想，将它奉献给那个目的。",
	"You bring a touch of magic to everyday materials and tasks, and as a result, the fruits of your labour bear a subtle—but potent—power. Savvy witches soon learn that common chores can be just as useful as flashier forms of spellcasting; they can channel magic just as easily by cooking up restorative meals, growing strange medicines in their gardens, weaving charm bracelets, and stitching protection into the seams of clothes. They also empower their familiars to aid them in spellcasting.": "你给日常材料和任务带来了一丝魔法，因此，你的劳动成果带有微妙但强大的力量。精明的女巫很快就会发现，普通的琐事和华丽的咒语一样有用；她们可以通过烹饪恢复能量的餐点、在花园里种植奇特的药材、编织魅力手链，以及在衣服的缝隙中缝入保护力量来轻松地引导魔法。她们还赋予自己的使者力量，让它们帮助自己施展魔法。",
	"The minor results of a witch's craft—potions, salves, one-use charms, and favours—are commonly called tokens, and any given witch can expect to make countless numbers of them in their lifetime. Many witches make a living by trading tokens with those in need, although few ever become wealthy that way.": "巫师的小成果——药水、药膏、一次性魔咒和恩惠——通常被称为令牌，任何一位巫师都可以期望在一生中制作无数个令牌。许多巫师通过与有需要的人交换令牌谋生，尽管很少有人通过这种方式变得富有。",
	"Any 1st-level witch spell that targets one or more creatures can be crafted into a token with 1 hour of labour. To craft it, you must have an unexpended spell slot of a high enough level to cast the spell (you need not have the spell prepared) and you must succeed on a Wisdom check using artisan's tools with a DC of 10 + the spell's level. On a failure, the item isn't created; if the check fails by 5 or more, you also expend a spell slot of the spell's level. You can attempt to make a single token during a short or long rest. Tokens take a form appropriate to the artisan's tools you use to create them. An herbalism kit might produce a potion or salve; chef's tools might produce a cupcake.": "任何1级巫师法术，只要其目标是一个或多个生物，都可以用1小时的劳动制作成一枚护符。要制作它，你必须拥有一个足够高等级的未使用法术位来施放该法术（你无需准备该法术），并且你必须使用工匠工具进行一次以法术等级为基础的智力检定，检定 DC 为10 + 该法术的等级。如果检定失败，护符不会被制作出来；如果检定失败的值超过5，你还会消耗一个等同于该法术等级的法术位。你可以在短暂休息或长休息期间尝试制作一枚护符。护符的形态会根据你用来制作它的工匠工具而异。比如，草药工具包可能制造出一瓶药水或药膏；厨师工具可能制造出一个杯子蛋糕。",
	"Once created, a creature holding the token can cast the spell from it using your spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The token then loses its magical properties, becoming a mundane item of its kind. At 9th level, you can create a token with any witch spell of 2nd level or lower. At 13th level, you can create a token with any witch spell of 3rd level or lower.": "一旦创建，持有令牌的生物可以使用你的法术豁免 DC、法术命中加值和施法能力从中施放法术。如果法术需要集中，生物必须集中精力。然后令牌失去其魔法属性，变成一种普通的同类物品。在9级时，你可以创建一个带有任何2级或更低级别的女巫法术的令牌。在13级时，你可以创建一个带有任何3级或更低级别的女巫法术的令牌。",
	"You can maintain a number of active tokens equal to your proficiency bonus. If you make an additional token while at your limit, the magic fades from your oldest token.": "你可以保持数量等于你熟练加值的活跃令牌。如果你在达到上限时制造额外的令牌，那么最老的令牌将失去魔力。",
	"When you put your back into your craft and devote a little part of yourself to what you're making, you can weave your magic into a talisman that will last forever. Many witches make talismans of their hats, boots, cloaks, or walking sticks. Brooms, athames, keys, and tools are also popular. Some witches guard their talismans jealously, but others craft them specifically for heroes, loved ones, or younger witches under their tutelage.": "当你全身心投入到你的手艺中，并把自己的一部分投入到你正在制作的物品中时，你可以将自己的魔力编织成一个永恒的护身符。许多女巫用他们的帽子、靴子、斗篷或手杖制作护身符。扫帚、祭刀、钥匙和工具也很受欢迎。一些女巫会嫉妒地保护他们的护身符，但也有一些是专门为英雄、亲人或在他们指导下的年轻女巫制作的。",
	"Any witch spell that doesn't require a costly material component can be crafted into a talisman if you have an unexpended spell slot of a high enough level to cast it (you need not have the spell prepared). To craft a talisman, you must spend 24 hours of labor (this time need not be continuous) and make a DC 20 Wisdom check using artisan's tools. On a success, you permanently sacrifice a spell slot of the spell's level to complete the talisman.": "任何不需要昂贵材料组件的女巫咒语，如果你有足够高等级的未使用法术位来施放它，都可以制作成护身符（你无需准备这个咒语）。要制作一个护身符，你必须花费24小时的劳动时间（这段时间不需要连续）并使用工匠工具进行一次DC 20的智力检定。成功后，你永久牺牲一个该咒语等级的法术位来完成这个护身符。",
	"A creature holding the talisman can cast that spell from it, using your spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability. Once the talisman is used to cast its spell, it can't be used that way again until the next dawn.": "一个持有护身符的生物可以使用它施放那个法术，使用你的法术豁免 DC，法术命中加值和施法能力。一旦护身符被用来施放法术，直到第二天黎明之前它就不能再以这种方式使用。",
	"You can add more spells to a talisman, or more uses of the same spell, with an additional 24 hours of labour, another Wisdom check using artisan's tools, and another sacrificed spell slot of the appropriate level.": "你可以在护身符上添加更多的法术，或者增加相同法术的使用次数，需要额外花费24小时的劳动时间，进行另一次以工匠工具进行的智力检定，以及牺牲另一个相应等级的法术位。",
	"You can recover the sacrificed spell slot by holding the talisman for 1 minute. The talisman ceases to be a magic item, and you regain that spell slot the next time you finish a long rest. Similarly, if the talisman is destroyed, you regain the spell slot when you finish your next long rest.": "你可以通过持有护身符1分钟来恢复被牺牲的法术位。护身符不再是一个魔法物品，你会在下次完成长休时恢复那个法术位。同样地，如果护身符被摧毁，你会在完成下次长休时恢复那个法术位。",
	"Alternatively, you can sacrifice a 3rd-level spell slot to craft an item from the Common or Uncommon Items table, or a 6th-level spell slot to craft an item from the Rare Items table.": "或者，你可以牺牲一个三级法术位来制作一个普通或罕见物品表中的物品，或者牺牲一个六级法术位来制作一个稀有物品表中的物品。",

You can choose to invest a willing bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel (or any other CR 0 creature approved by your GM) with magical power. Your familiar acts independently of you, but they generally heed your requests. In combat, they roll their own initiative and act on their own turn.": "一位女巫的（familiar）是她们终身的伴侣和朋友。你可以选择将一只乐意的蝙蝠，猫，螃蟹，青蛙（toad），鹰，蜥蜴，章鱼，猫头鹰，毒蛇，鱼（quipper），老鼠，乌鸦，海马，蜘蛛，或黄鼠狼（或其他任何CR 0生物，需经GM批准）赋予魔力。你的（familiar）会独立行动，但通常会听从你的请求。在战斗中，它们会自行掷骰决定先攻，并在自己的回合行动。",
	"When your familiar is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction to expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to make them drop to 1 hit point instead. If your familiar dies, you can perform a ritual to revive them during a short or long rest. The ritual requires 10 gp of herbs or incense, and your familiar returns to life with all their hit points.": "当你的使魔被降至0点生命值时，你可以使用一次反应，消耗一个1级或更高级的法术位，使它们的生命值降至1点。如果你的使魔死亡，你可以在短暂休息或长休息期间执行一个仪式来复活它们。这个仪式需要价值10gp的草药或香料，你的使魔会以全部生命值复活。",
	"You can communicate telepathically with your familiar, regardless of distance. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what they hear until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you choose another animal as your witch's familiar, you lose your connection to your previous familiar.": "你可以与你的使魔进行心灵感应沟通，无论距离有多远。此外，作为一个动作，你可以通过你的使魔的眼睛看到和听到它所看到和听到的，直到你的下一个回合开始，获得使魔拥有的任何特殊感知能力的好处。在此期间，你对自己的感官是聋哑的。你不能同时拥有多个使魔。如果你选择另一种动物作为你的女巫使魔，你将失去与之前使魔的联系。",
	"When you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if they had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and they must use their reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it.

Damage that you take can't break your concentration on the spell, though the spell your familiar is concentrating on ends if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can transfer concentration on the spell back to yourself as a bonus action by touching your familiar.": "当你保持对一个法术的集中力并触摸你的使魔时，你可以将集中力转移给你的使魔作为一个奖励动作。你受到的伤害不会打破你对该法术的集中，尽管如果你施放另一个需要集中力的法术，你的使魔正在集中的法术会结束。你可以通过触摸你的使魔将法术的集中力再次转移回自己作为一个奖励动作。",

Their care is harsh and truthful, but they fiercely protect their territory and those within it against harm and exploitation.": "生活在荒野和孤立的偏远地方，爪之女巫团的智慧是深刻的、沉思的，常常是苦行的。爪女巫们照顾着他们的同伴——那些局外人、捕兽者、猎人和隐士，没有其他人来照看他们，也照顾那些被迫走上艰难道路，深远而遥远，来寻找她们的人。她们的关怀是严厉而真实的，但她们会激烈地保护自己的领地和其中的人免受伤害和剥削。",

If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the witch spell list, the spell is nonetheless a witch spell for you.": "一旦你获得这些法术中的一个，你就会始终准备好它，并且它不计入你每天可以准备的法术数量。如果你获得了一种不在女巫法术清单上的法术，那么对你来说，这个法术仍然是女巫法术。",

They understand best the symmetry between people and the natural world, the dancing of bees and the games that hares and foxes play, and how the roots of trees and fungi lace together and support a stump that's been cut. But being so aware of the big picture places them beyond and apart from it; green witches tend to settle well outside of towns and villages, if only a short trip away. A gardener tends the flower beds, but she isn't herself a flower.": "绿色女巫团是古老药用智慧的守护者，通过细心培育生长的植物，并将它们转化为营养、护身符、药膏和药草，展现出他们的关怀。她们最懂得人类与自然界之间的对称，蜜蜂的舞蹈，野兔和狐狸玩耍的场景，以及树根和真菌如何交织在一起支撑着被砍伐的树桩。然而，对整体情况如此了解使她们超越并独立于其中；绿色女巫们往往选择在城镇和村庄之外安家，即使只是一个短途旅行的距离。一个园丁照料花坛，但她本身并不是一朵花。",

Beings that display this virtue are especially tempting targets for your ire.": "一位邪恶的女巫可能声称是全世界的敌人，但她们总是对一种特定类型的人有着特别的憎恶 —— 通常与她们过去的自我有关，以及导致她们魔法变质的原因。当你变得邪恶时，选择一个对你来说是大忌的美德：勇气、公平、慷慨、纯真、忠诚、善良、乐观、谨慎、无私，或者是爱情。展现这种美德的存在尤其容易激起你的愤怒。",
	"When a witch begins to go wicked, their magic warps, and they lose access to some of their coven spells. This should be a conversation between the player and the GM. The line between righteous retribution and vindictive cruelty can be very thin, but witchcraft permits the former and condemns the latter.": "当一个女巫开始变得邪恶时，她们的魔法会扭曲，失去对一些她们魔法同盟的法术的访问。这应该是玩家和主持人之间的对话。正义报应和恶意残忍之间的界限可能非常微弱，但巫术允许前者，谴责后者。",
