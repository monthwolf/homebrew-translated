	"As the graying man made his way through the underbrush of the forest his faded green cloak made him nearly invisible. The exceptionally large troll he had been stalking through the night had finally stopped to rest. As the great brute laid down to sleep, a silent green shape emerged from the trees to snuff out the life of the hideous monster.": "当这个白发苍苍的男人穿过森林的灌木丛时，他褪色的绿色斗篷使他几乎看不见。他在夜里跟踪的那个特别大的巨魔终于停下来休息了。当这个巨大的畜生躺下睡觉时，一个无声的绿色身影从树上冒了出来，扼杀了这个可怕的怪物的生命。",
	"As the massive blue dragon descended upon the small town, a small half-elven man rolled out of the path of a blast of lightning. With the small hairs on the back of their neck still standing up from the residual electricity, the practiced hunter knocked an arrow and let it fly in the direction of the terrible beast. As the biting dart struck true, the azure dragon let out a horrible roar and plummeted to the ground where it lay in a broken heap.": "当巨大的蓝龙降临小镇时，一个半精灵的小个子男人从一阵闪电的路径中滚了出来。脖子上的小汗毛还在因为残余的电流而竖起来，这个有经验的猎人敲了一支箭，让它飞向那只可怕的野兽的方向。当那只咬人的飞镖射中目标时，天蓝色的龙发出一声可怕的吼叫，并坠落到地面上，在那里它躺在一个破碎的一堆。",
	"As the massive owlbear slowly lumbered toward the tiny hamlet that she called home, a small halfling girl whistled to her companion in the brush. At her signal, a giant hound that seemed to be more fur then anything else, leaped out from hiding and stood defiantly in front of the owlbear. Distracted by her partner, the owlbear was caught completely unawares by the diminutive ranger. Once their foe was unconscious, the halfling and her dog released the great owlbear miles away where it could live without menacing the town they protected.": "当这只巨大的猫头鹰熊慢慢地走向她称之为家的小村庄时，一个小半身人女孩向她在灌木丛中的同伴吹起了口哨。在她的示意下，一只巨大的猎犬从藏身处跃出，挑衅地站在猫头鹰熊的面前，它的毛发似乎比其他东西更多。猫头鹰熊被她的伙伴分散了注意力，完全没有想到会被这个矮小的游侠抓住。一旦他们的敌人失去了知觉，半身人和她的狗就把这只伟大的猫头鹰熊释放到数英里之外，让它在那里生活，而不会威胁到他们保护的城镇。",
	"Rangers spend their lives between two worlds. On one hand they stand as guardians of civilization, protecting those who dwell on the edges of society. On the other, rangers are expert survivalists, deeply acquainted with the flora and fauna of the natural world. Rangers protect the balance between society and the wilderness.

When people encroach upon the wilderness, rangers will push back against industry and expansion that doesn't respect the natural balance.": "游骑兵在两个世界之间度过他们的生活。一方面，他们作为文明的守护者，保护那些居住在社会边缘的人。另一方面，护林员是生存专家，对自然界的动植物有很深的了解。护林员保护社会和荒野之间的平衡。当野生动物离开它们的自然栖息地时，护林员会在它们伤害无辜的农民和旅行者之前追踪它们。当人们侵占荒野时，护林员将对不尊重自然平衡的工业和扩张进行反击。",

	"Consider the nature of your ranger's training. Did you train with a mentor, wandering the wilds together, learning all you could? Or did you forge your primal connection to the natural world on your own? What is it that motivates your ranger? Do you have a vendetta against a certain type of monster? Are you a warrior of the wild who feels more comfortable in the silence of the forest then in city streets or sleepy towns?": "考虑一下你的游侠训练的性质。你是和导师一起训练，一起在荒野中游荡，学习所有你能学到的东西？还是你自己建立了与自然世界的原始联系？是什么在激励着你的游侠？你对某种类型的怪物有仇吗？你是一个在寂静的森林中，而在城市街道或沉睡的城镇中感到更舒适的野生战士吗？",
