	"A young girl leaps forward through the flames, her shining silver hair contrasting her ochre skin under the light of the fire. She throws her dagger quickly toward the cultist before her, but it vanishes in a flash of light just after leaving her hand. The foe advances on her before letting out a ghastly moan and falling to the floor. A small dagger sticks out of the center of his back.": "一个年轻女孩跃过火焰，她闪亮的银发在火光下与她的赭色皮肤形成鲜明对比。她迅速朝着面前的异教徒投掷匕首，但在离开手后，匕首在一道闪光中消失了。敌人向她挺进，然后发出一声可怕的呻吟，倒在地板上。一把小匕首从他的背中心突出。",
	"An old elven man stands at the precipice of an enormously tall cliff, his cracked spectacles sitting low on his withered nose. He stares out into the distance, a bright and beautiful wilderness of verdant green mountains and valleys, accented by two massive floating islands of stone. He chuckles to himself, only slightly, before his view is obstructed by a flash of light and a disk of swirling colors opens up before him.": "一个年迈的精灵老人站在一个极高悬崖的边缘，他那破旧的眼镜斜斜地挂在枯槁的鼻子上。他凝视着远方，那里是一片明亮而美丽的原野，翠绿的山脉和峡谷交相辉映，还有两座巨大的漂浮石岛。他轻轻地对自己笑了笑，然后他的视野被一道闪光和一圈旋转的色彩所遮挡，一个盘旋着色彩的圆盘在他面前打开。",
	"Nomads are planar travelers, hunters, trackers, vagabonds, and explorers. They are experts in the traversal of the planes whose wanderlust is never satisfied and whose Journey is unending.": "游牧民族是平面旅行者，猎人，追踪者，流浪者和探险家。他们是穿梭于各个位面的专家，他们的漫游欲望永不满足，旅程永无止境。",
	"The life of a nomad is one of discovery and adventure, chasing a concept known as The Journey. This is the final goal of most nomads, a goal of experiencing every facet of existence. Nomads travel in pursuit of all of the things that will occur to them along the way, absorbing and enjoying all life's experiences.": "游牧民的生活是探索和冒险的生活，追逐一种被称为“旅程”的概念。这是大多数游牧民的最终目标，是体验存在的每一个方面的目标。游牧民旅行追寻沿途发生的一切事物，吸收并享受生活的所有经历。",
	"Some choose to organize and take up large parties, traversing the planes together in search of interpersonal experiences. Others enjoy the solitude of a personal Journey, opting to explore the infinite possibilities of the cosmos alone.": "有些人选择组织并参加大型派对，在一起穿越各个位面，寻找人际体验。另一些人喜欢独自一人的旅程，选择独自探索宇宙的无限可能性。",
	"Nomads generally have a hard time settling down in any one place for too long, even when their years have nearly finished. Ending The Journey before they pass on simply never occurs to most, such is the ambition of the nomad.": "游牧民族通常很难在一个地方安定下来太久，即使他们的岁月已近尽头。对大多数游牧民族来说，甚至在他们离世之前结束旅程根本不会发生，这就是游牧民族的雄心壮志。",
	"Those who travel the planes find themselves drawn to certain aspects of one plane or another. With time and distance this attraction, or link, grows stronger, drawing the nomad's mind back to it for reasons they may not understand. This link draws on certain aspects deep inside a person's soul and binds it to the plane, a permanent manifestation of the planes and their otherworldly power fixed in the mind of the traveller.": "那些穿梭于各个位面的人会发现自己被某个位面的某些方面所吸引。随着时间和距离的增长，这种吸引力或联系会变得更加强烈，让游荡者的思维不由自主地回到那个位面，原因可能是他们无法理解的。这种联系激发了一个人灵魂深处的某些方面，并将其与该位面联系在一起，成为旅行者心灵中永久的体现。这是位面及其超自然力量在旅行者心中固定的永恒表现。",
	"Those who research the planes have theorized that a force similar to tectonic shifts in the earth occurs between the planes, generating powerful magic. This magic has something similar to a grand sentience, and can \"see\" the creatures it affects. From these theories arose a kind of worship among some nomads, where they view themselves as minor patrons of the eldritch existence that is The Great Wheel itself, though not all believe this story.": "那些研究位面的人认为，在位面之间发生类似于地球地壳构造运动的力量，产生强大的魔法。这种魔法具有类似于宏大意识，并且可以“看到”它影响的生物。从这些理论中产生了一种崇拜，一些游牧民族将自己视为那个神秘存在——大轮回本身的小保护者，尽管并非所有人都相信这个故事。",
	"The link a nomad forms may be a tangible choice that they expect or feel immediately, or it may be that a plane one only passed through briefly left a subtle impression upon their mind.": "游牧民形成的联系可能是他们期望或立即感受到的一个具体选择，也可能是他们只是短暂经过的一个地方在他们心灵上留下了微妙的印象。",
	"In the creation of your nomad character, consider what made them take up The Journey in the first place, and why they continue in their quest. Did your father or mother bring you along on their travels? Did you hear of some fantastical tale of planes far away? Or did you simply become bored with the mundane triviality of the material?": "在创造你的游牧者角色时，考虑一下是什么让他们首次踏上了（旅程）(`The Journey`)，以及为什么他们继续追寻。是你的父亲或母亲带着你一起旅行吗？你是否听说过一些遥远平面的神话故事？还是你只是对物质生活的平庸琐事感到厌倦了？",
	"What have you done on your Journey? Was there a perilous dash through Pandemonium and the Nine Hells? A calm stroll through Bytopia that made you rethink your motivations? Could there even have been a whirlwind romp through the most renowned taverns of the outer planes?": "你在旅途中做了什么？是否曾在混乱地狱和九层地狱中进行危险的冲刺？是否曾在拜托比亚平静地漫步，让你重新思考自己的动机？甚至可能在外部位面最著名的酒馆中疾风骤雨般地狂欢过？",
	"How has your planar link affected you? Maybe you found yourself linked to a hideous plane of evil despite your cloistered youth, and it has drawn out dark thoughts that you had once forgotten? Or did you truly connect with your plane and have often fought yourself on whether to remain there, only to leave it behind?": "你的位面链接是如何影响你的？也许你发现自己与一个邪恶的位面联系在一起，尽管你年少时生活在与世隔绝的环境中，它唤起了你曾经忘记的黑暗思想？或者你真正与你的位面建立了联系，经常在是否留在那里与自己进行内心挣扎，最终还是选择离开了它？",
	"The great variety of planes and nomads means that they can fall into any alignment or planar link, though most who have seen the extremes of  good, evil, law, and chaos prefer to remain neutral.": "众多的位面和游牧民族意味着它们可以落入任何取向或位面联系中，尽管大多数见过善恶、秩序和混沌的极端的人更倾向于保持中立。",
	"You can make a nomad quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength or Dexterity should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. Second, choose the {@background outlander} background.": "按照当地语言习惯，文本中像(%num%)这样的内容在翻译中应保持为(%num%)。\n\n你可以通过以下建议快速创建一个游牧者。首先，力量或敏捷应该是你最高的能力值，其次是智力。其次，选择{@background outlander}背景。",
	"As a nomad, you are a master of minor portals, and can use them to enhance your combat abilities. At 1st level, when you take the {@action Attack} action on your turn with a melee weapon, the reach of your weapon becomes 10 feet until the end of your turn as you conjure a short-range portal through which your weapon passes mid-swing. Attacks made in this way don't ignore cover and require the target to be visible. This technique requires one of your hands to be free to create the portal. Additionally you can utilize your portals with the fast-moving projectiles of ranged weapons, allowing you to make Far Strike attacks with them. This does not change the range of the weapon.": "作为一个游牧者，你是小型传送门的大师，可以利用它们增强你的战斗能力。在1级时，当你使用近战武器进行{@action Attack}动作时，你的武器射程变为10英尺，直到你的回合结束，因为你召唤了一个短程传送门，让你的武器在半空中穿过。用这种方式进行的攻击不会无视掩护，并且需要目标可见。这项技能需要你的一只手空着来创建传送门。此外，你还可以利用你的传送门与远程武器的快速投射物结合，使你能够用远程武器进行远程打击。这不会改变武器的射程。",
	"Your Far Strike Range increases to 20 feet when you reach 11th level, and 30 feet when you reach 18th level.": "你的远程打击范围在11级时增加到20英尺，在18级时增加到30英尺。",
	"You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.": "你选择了一种特定的战斗风格作为你的专长。选择以下其中一种选项。即使你有机会再次选择，也不能再选择相同的战斗风格选项。",
	"At 2nd level, you learn to utilize your portals in thoughtful and unique ways. You begin with one simple Portal Art: Portal, and gain additional Portal Arts options as you gain levels in this class.": "在2级时，你学会了以深思熟虑和独特的方式利用你的传送门。你从一个简单的传送门艺术开始：传送门，并在这个职业中不断提升等级时获得额外的传送门艺术选项。",
	"You choose what effect you create when you use your Portal Arts. You have a number of uses of these arts equal to your Intelligence modifier. All expended uses are restored when you finish a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short or long rest}.": "当你使用你的传送门艺术时，你可以选择创造什么样的效果。你可以使用的次数等于你的智力调整值。当你完成一次{@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short or long rest}后，所有已使用的次数都会恢复。",
	"Your Portal Arts are dependent upon your Intelligence, your knowledge of the planes from which you draw these effects.": "你的传送门艺术取决于你的智力，以及你对从中汲取这些效果的位面的了解。",
	"Some Portal Arts require a saving throw. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC is calculated as follows:": "一些传送门艺术需要进行豁免检定。当你使用这个职业的效果时，豁免 DC 的计算如下：",
	"As an action on your turn, you expend a use of your Portal Arts to create linked teleportation portals that remain open for up to 1 minute, until 4 creatures or objects have passed through them, or until you choose to close them as a bonus action. Choose two unoccupied spaces on the ground that you can see, one within 5 feet of you and the other within 30 feet of you. A portal opens over each point. The portals are glowing, oblong, spheroids hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it.": "在你的回合中，你可以使用你的传送艺术之力，创造出相连的传送门。这些传送门会保持开启状态，持续1分钟，或者直到有4个生物或物体穿过它们，或者你选择将其作为一个奖励动作关闭。选择两个你可以看到的未被占据的地面空间，一个距离你不超过5英尺，另一个距离你不超过30英尺。在每个点上方会打开一个传送门。这些传送门呈椭圆形，悬浮在离地面几英寸的位置，并且与地面垂直。每个传送门中充满了浓雾，使得无法透过它看到对面的景象。",
	"Any Medium or smaller creature or object entering the space the portal occupies exits from the other portal as if the two were the same space. For example, if an arrow enters the portal from the east, it will emerge from the west as if it had passed through any other empty space. A creature forced into the portal's space can make a Dexterity saving throw to resist moving through it, emerging in the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to the portal on a successful save.": "任何中等或更小的生物或物体进入传送门所占据的空间，将从另一个传送门中出来，就好像这两个空间是相同的。例如，如果一支箭从东边进入传送门，它将从西边出来，就好像它穿过了任何其他空的空间一样。被迫进入传送门空间的生物可以进行敏捷豁免才能抵抗通过它移动，成功豁免的话会出现在传送门附近最近的未被占据的空间中。",
	"The range of the second portal increases to 60 feet at 11th level and 120 feet at 17th level.": "第二传送门的范围在11级时增加到60英尺，在17级时增加到120英尺。",
	"Nomads are travellers, and often they traverse all manner of planes and demiplanes in their lives. Much like travellers of the material, though, they always hold within their hearts some link to a certain plane. At 3rd level, you have matured in your travels enough to have established a magical and personal link. There are obviously a great many planes and regions in the multiverse. Some common Planar Links that are presented at the end of this class description are {@class Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|The Elemental Planes|Elemental Plane|NMD:BN}, {@class Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|The Far Realms|Far Realm|NMD:BN} and {@class Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|The Astral Plane|Astral Plane|NMD:BN}.": "游牧民族是旅行者，通常在他们的生活中穿越各种各样的位面和半位面。就像物质位面的旅行者一样，他们的内心总是与某个特定位面有着联系。在3级时，你在旅行中已经成熟到建立了一种魔法和个人联系。在多元宇宙中有许多位面和地区。在本职业描述的末尾列出了一些常见的位面联系，分别是{@class Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|The Elemental Planes|Elemental Plane|NMD:BN}，{@class Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|The Far Realms|Far Realm|NMD:BN}和{@class Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|The Astral Plane|Astral Plane|NMD:BN}。",
	"Your Planar Link grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 10th, and 14th level.": "你的位面链接在3级时赋予你特性，然后在7级、10级和14级时再次获得特性。",
	"At 6th level, you reflexes develop, allowing you to jump through the portals you create with {@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN}. When you hit a creature with a melee {@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN} attack, you can expend a use of your Portal Arts to jump through the portal created around your weapon, emerging in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. If the attack is made with a ranged weapon, you can choose to move up to your {@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN} range in any direction after the attack.": "在第6级时，你的反射能力得到了发展，使你能够通过你用{@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN}创建的传送门跳跃。当你用近战{@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN}攻击命中一名生物时，你可以消耗一个你的传送门艺术使用次数，跳过围绕你的武器创建的传送门，出现在距离目标5英尺内的一个空位。如果使用远程武器进行攻击，你可以选择在攻击后向任意方向移动，最多移动你的{@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN}射程。",
	"By 9th level, you can blink from place to place with ease. Once on your turn if you get at least a 10 foot run up in a straight line, you can teleport to a range equal to up to half your movement, appearing in an unoccupied space that you can see. You still expend movement as if you were walking. Taking the {@action Dash} action can increase the range that you can teleport.": "到了9级，你可以轻松地从一个地方闪烁到另一个地方。在你的回合中，如果你至少有10英尺的直线奔跑，你可以传送到一个距离不超过你移动速度一半的范围内，出现在一个你能看到的未被占据的空间中。你仍然会消耗移动速度，就像在走路一样。使用{@action Dash}动作可以增加你可以传送的范围。",
	"By 11th level, you have learned to create special portals with multiple exits. Once on your turn, you can target a second creature with one of your {@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN} attacks when you take the {@action Attack} action. The same, single attack roll is used for both targets of the attack.": "到了11级，你学会了创造具有多个出口的特殊传送门。在你的回合中，当你进行{@action Attack}动作时，你可以用你的{@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN}攻击之一瞄准第二个生物。同一次攻击检定适用于攻击的两个目标。",
	"At 17th level, you no longer have to search for planar portals. As an action on your turn, you establish an interplanar link. You open a portal to a location on a plane that you have been to before and remember in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The portal's destination must be on a plane you are not currently on, and it is visible through the portal.": "在17级时，你不再需要寻找位面传送门。在你的回合内作为一个动作，你可以建立一个位面链接。你可以在你曾经去过并且记得的位面上，在你附近5英尺内的未被占据的空间中打开一个传送门。传送门的目的地必须是你目前不在的一个位面，并且可以通过传送门看到。",
	"The portal is large enough for Medium or smaller creatures to pass through easily. A creature that is forced into the portal can make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid going through. On a successful save, the creature appears in an occupied space adjacent to the portal.": "传送门足够大，适合中等或更小体型的生物轻松通过。被迫进入传送门的生物可以进行一次敏捷豁免才能避免通过传送门。豁免成功的话，生物会出现在传送门旁边一个已被占据的空间中。",
	"Otherwise, they are sent through the port and its destination. The portal remains open for 1 minute until you close it as a bonus action on your turn.": "否则，它们将被发送到港口及其目的地。传送门将保持开启状态1分钟，直到你在你的回合上将其作为奖励动作关闭。",

	"At 20th level, your skill for creating portals becomes unsurpassed, allowing you to create portals stable enough to withstand the test of time. With 4 hours of work and 2000 gp in materials you can create a permanent planar gateway large enough for Medium or smaller creatures, or double the time and cost for Large or smaller creatures. You must create two gateways to be able to travel between them.": "在20级时，你创建传送门的技能达到无与伦比的境界，可以创造足够稳定经受时间考验的传送门。通过4小时的工作和2000 gp的材料，你可以创造一个足够大以容纳中型或更小生物的永久性位面之门，或者对于大型或更小生物，时间和成本加倍。你必须创建两个传送门才能在它们之间进行旅行。",
	"Gateways created by this feature are round frames of wood, metal, or other materials that house a portal and keep it stable in the absence of its creator. If the frame is made incomplete in any way, such as by it being burned, crushed, or toppled, the portal closes immediately.": "此特性创建的传送门是由木头、金属或其他材料制成的圆形框架，用于容纳传送门并在其创造者不在场时保持稳定。如果框架以任何方式变得不完整，比如被烧毁、压碎或倒塌，传送门会立即关闭。",
	"You can maintain a maximum of 6 gateways at one time. Each gateway can only be linked to one other one, creating a two-way portal. Any creature that can fit within a portal travels through it when they come into contact with it. A gateway's portal can be deactivated with a 1-minute ritual, allowing them to be linked with a different gateway, or simply switched off for a time.": "你最多可以同时维护6个门户。每个门户只能连接到另一个门户，形成一个双向传送门。任何能够适应传送门的生物在接触到传送门时会穿越它。一个门户的传送门可以通过一个1分钟的仪式来停用，从而可以将其连接到另一个门户，或者简单地关闭一段时间。",
	"Practice care in the use of gateways. If discovered by unwanted cosmic guests, they may endanger entire planes.": "在使用传送门时要小心。如果被不速之客发现，可能会危及整个位面。",
	"The stability of your portals is strong enough that they can withstand a struggle within them. When you reach 7th level, you can attempt to {@action grapple} creatures from afar.": "你的传送门稳定性足够强大，可以经受其中的斗争。当你达到7级时，你可以尝试{@action grapple}远处的生物。",
	"As an action on your turn, you can create a particularly stable portal within your {@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN} range and thrust your arm through it, attempting to grab the target. Make an Unarmed Strike against the target. On hit, you successfully {@action grapple} the target if it is no more than one size larger than you. You can continue to hold it for up to one minute, or until you move within 5 feet of the target. The target can make a Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns, escaping the {@action grapple} on a success. You can only have one creature {@condition grappled} in this way at any time.": "在你的回合中，你可以在你的{@classFeature Far Strike|Nomad (Modified)|NMD:BN|1|NMD:BN}范围内创建一个特别稳定的传送门，并伸出手臂，试图抓住目标。对目标进行一次徒手攻击。命中后，如果目标不比你大超过一个尺寸，则你成功{@action grapple}目标。你可以继续保持这种状态最多一分钟，或者直到你移动到目标的5英尺内。目标可以在每个回合结束时进行一次力量豁免才能逃脱{@action grapple}。你一次只能这样地控制一个生物{@condition grappled}。",

	"You have become linked to one or more of the elemental planes, the four sources of elemental power in the multiverse. Maybe their simple purity of form calls out to a longing for simplicity within you, or maybe your fiery spirit or fluid world-view finds itself most at home among these planes. Regardless, you have amassed a great knowledge of these planes and their most powerful locations, and can draw upon them with your portals.": "你已经与元素位面中的一个或多个相连，这些位面是多元宇宙中元素力量的四个来源。也许它们简单纯粹的形式呼唤着你内心对简单的渴望，或者你炽热的精神或流动的世界观发现自己在这些位面中感到最舒适。无论如何，你已经积累了对这些位面及其最强大地点的深刻了解，并可以通过你的传送门利用它们。",
	"At 3rd level when you choose this link, you begin to use your portals to bring forth the powers of the Elemental Planes.
