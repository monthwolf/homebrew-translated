	"A ragged young man fled down an alley in a vain attempt to lose the thugs that pursued him. As their shadows grew longer, he realized that he had no choice. As the ruffians pinned him against the wall, he looked inward and called upon the sinister entity bound to his soul. When he finally regained his senses, the smell of sulfur was overwhelming. He fled the alleyway, leaving the charred remains of the brigands behind. They were but the latest victims of the dark presence he harbored within.": "一个衣衫褴褛的年轻人在一条小巷里逃窜，试图摆脱追赶他的暴徒。随着他们的阴影变得越来越长，他意识到他别无选择。当暴徒们将他按在墙上时，他内心深处呼唤着与他灵魂相绑的邪恶实体。当他最终恢复神智时，硫磺的气味让人窒息。他逃离了小巷，留下了焦黑的暴徒尸体。他们只是他内心承载的黑暗存在的最新受害者。",
	"An austere elven woman stood on a raised dais at the center of a crowded amphitheater. Members of the church hierarchy and common folk alike had come to witness her awesome transformation. She did not know why she was chosen, but within her soul was bound a fallen heavenly being, charged to perform one hundred and one good deeds in order to regain its status in the celestial courts. As the crowd gathered round, she said a prayer and gave herself over to the overwhelming radiance.": "一位朴素的(Elven)（精灵）女子站在拥挤的圆形剧场中央的一座高台上。教会的高层和普通民众都来见证她令人敬畏的转变。她不知道为什么会被选中，但她的灵魂中绑定着一个堕落的天使，被命令要完成一百零一件善事，以恢复其在天庭中的地位。当人群聚集时，她默默祈祷，将自己奉献给压倒性的光辉。",
	"The strange elderly halfling knew that he did not belong in the tower he called home. The tower's keeper, a reclusive old archmage, only kept him around as a reminder of what would happen to any who dared cross him. At night, the halfling could hear crying inside of his head, the sounds of a former student who had attempted to overthrow the great archmage, now bound to the aging body and soul of the lowliest student.": "那个奇怪的老哈尔夫人知道他并不属于他称之为家的塔。塔的守护者，一个隐居的老大法师，只是把他留在身边，作为任何胆敢违抗他的人将会遭遇的提醒。夜晚，哈尔夫人能听到他脑海中的哭声，是一位曾试图推翻伟大大法师的前学生的声音，如今被绑定在最卑微学生的老体和灵魂上。",

	"Within every Vessel is bound an extraplanar being of strange and wondrous power. No matter their origin, these immortal Spirits cannot be killed by conventional means. Instead, they are often bound to mortal flesh, forced to dwell within a body on the material plane. While many such Spirits are bound to their Vessel against their will, some choose to dwell within a mortal, lending them power in causes that align with theirs.": "每个容器内都封印着一位来自异界的奇妙力量的存在。无论它们的起源如何，这些不朽的灵魂无法被常规手段杀死。相反，它们经常被束缚在凡人的肉体中，被迫在物质位面上居住。虽然许多这样的灵魂被迫与容器绑定，但也有一些选择寄居在凡人身上，为那些与它们目标一致的事业提供力量。",

	"When creating a Vessel, the most important thing to consider is how you came to be bound to the Spirit within you. Are you the Acolyte of a god, chosen to bear one of its angels that has fallen from grace? Are you a prophetic child of a cult, forced to bear the sinister power of their infernal lord? Or, are you descended from a bloodline of Vessels, each parent passing the Spirit on to their child when they have reached old age?": "在创造一个载体时，最重要的考虑因素是你是如何与内在的灵魂相绑定的。你是一个神的侍僧，被选中承载一个堕落的天使吗？还是你是一个邪恶教派的预言之子，被迫承载他们地狱领主的邪恶力量？又或者，你是一个载体血统的后裔，每个父母在年老时将灵魂传给他们的孩子？",
	"Secondly, consider the nature of your Sealed Spirit and its relationship to you. Does your Spirit communicate with you freely, hoping that your goals will align?
