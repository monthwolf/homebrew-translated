	"Drawing the comparison between a bard and a dancer is inevitable; but the two are compliments, not competitors.

The Choreo of The Court adopts the traditions and mannerisms of nobility. Even if these dancers cannot claim the pedigree of noble birth, they are learned in the practices and pomp of patricians; be it from rubbing elbows with those of royal hierarchy or from instructing members of ruling families in this style. Sometimes seen as entitled and elitist, such behavior can hardly be considered out of place for one who is used to living in the lap of luxury. This high standard is not just applied to others however, as masters of this Choreo strive for nothing short of perfection in their every action, conducting themselves with a calculated tact and suave that allows them to navigate even the most treacherous of social environments as easily as they could a dance floor.": "贵族间奢华的派对基本上是贵族成员的一种仪式，因为政治在舞厅中的发展与在战争室中一样频繁。 《(The Court)宫廷舞者》采纳了贵族的传统和礼仪。即使这些舞者不能宣称自己具有贵族出身的血统，他们也精通贵族的做法和虚荣；无论是与皇室等级的人交往还是指导统治家族成员学习这种风格。有时被视为特权和精英主义，这种行为对于习惯于奢华生活的人来说几乎不能算是不合时宜。然而，这种高标准不仅适用于他人，作为这种舞蹈的大师，他们追求的绝不仅仅是完美，他们在每一个行动中都表现出精心策划的技巧和优雅，使他们能够在社交环境中轻松地航行，就像在舞池中一样。",
	"You gain proficiency with {@item rapier|PHB|rapiers}.

	"With bold, aggressive movements and chant-like non-verbal vocalizations that allow them to tap into the most primal and instinctual aspects of their viewers' minds, adepts of this Choreo use their dances to invigorate and strengthen the resolve of their allies and to terrify and break the morale of their foes, both on and off the battlefield. Most often found in governmental militaries, with mercenary units, or amongst the warriors of tribal societies, masters of this Choreo hold to the belief that though its techniques can be practiced in peace and safety, they may only be truly understood and perfected by experiencing the rage of war firsthand. When this has been achieved, these Dancers can work the meekest of allied forces into fervorous frenzies and send fear sweeping through the lines of battle hardened enemy armies like flames through a field of dry wheat.": "以大胆、激进的动作和类似咏唱的非语言声音，使他们能够触及观众心灵中最原始和本能的部分，这种舞蹈者利用他们的舞蹈来激励和增强盟友的决心，同时恐吓和打破敌人的士气，无论是在战场上还是离开战场。这种舞蹈者最常见于政府军队、雇佣部队或部落社会的战士中，掌握这种舞蹈的大师们坚信，尽管这些技巧可以在和平与安全中练习，但只有亲身经历战争的愤怒才能真正理解和完善。当这一点被实现时，这些舞者可以将最温顺的盟友部队激发为狂热的狂热，并像火焰席卷干旱麦田一样，让恐惧席卷战斗经验丰富的敌军阵线。",
