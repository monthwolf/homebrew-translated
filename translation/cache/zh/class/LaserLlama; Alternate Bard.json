With the eyes of all his foes on him, he began to play a masterful song ridiculing the frost giant lord.

	"The sprightly halfling let forth a mighty blast on her war horn and led the charge toward the hobgoblin legion. Not to be outdone, and inspired by the bravery of the halfling in her shining armor, the heroes drew their weapons and ran forward. When the battle was won, the valiant halfling sat down to write a ballad of the heroics of the day.": "这位活泼的半身人吹响她的战号，带领着冲向地精军团。为了不甘示弱，并受到穿着闪亮盔甲的半身人勇士的鼓舞，英雄们拔出武器向前冲去。当战斗胜利结束时，勇敢的半身人坐下来写下了当天英勇事迹的史诗。",

The versatile performers wander the world collecting tales, talents, knowledge, and unique magical abilities which they use to motivate and inspire heroism in their comrades.": "以上描述的三位英雄都被认为是诗人(Bards)。这些多才多艺的表演者漫游世界，收集故事、才华、知识和独特的魔法能力，用这些能力来激励和鼓舞同伴，激发英雄主义。",
	"The first tale every bardic mentor imparts to their protégé is the {@i Song of Creation}. Though the myth has many variations, they all tell of the multiverse being created by the song.

	"While not all Bards are wandering musicians, they each learn to draw upon the song of creation in their own unique way.

	"Bards are marked by an unquenchable desire to learn new things, master new skills, and gather strange tales. For these travelers, the call of adventure is nearly impossible to resist. They often find themselves in the company of heroes delving into forgotten tombs, deciphering ancient scrolls, and on the hunt for strange exotic creatures.

Indeed, after telling stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many Bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.": "诗人以一种无法抑制的渴望学习新事物、掌握新技能和收集奇怪故事而著称。对于这些旅行者来说，冒险的呼唤几乎是无法抗拒的。他们经常发现自己与英雄们同行，探索被遗忘的陵墓，解读古老的卷轴，追捕奇异的异国生物。任何一位能够讲述源自个人经历的令人敬畏故事的诗人都会在其他诗人中赢得声誉。事实上，在讲述英雄们完成伟大事迹的故事之后，许多诗人会将这些主题铭记在心，并扮演起英雄的角色。",
	"When creating your Bard, the most important thing for you to consider is your Bard's {@i Muse}, or inspiration. Do they seek out beauty in the world, writing ballads and songs inspired by the sights they see?
