	"As the aging man struggled to keep up with his companions, he started to regret his decision to join the young adventurers. His days of glory had long passed, but hearing the poorly devised plan of the aspiring heroes had rekindled something inside his soul that he thought gone forever. The old man couldn't use a sword like he used to, but if his young companions took his advice, they may yet be able to survive the dangerous life an adventure for a few days.": "当这位年迈的男子努力跟上他的同伴时，他开始后悔加入这些年轻冒险者的决定。他辉煌的日子早已过去，但听到这些志向高远的英雄们制定的糟糕计划，重新点燃了他内心深处曾经以为永远消失的东西。这位老人已经不能像过去那样运用剑术，但如果他的年轻同伴听取他的建议，也许他们仍然能够在冒险生活中生存几天。",
	"A graying dwarf surveyed the enemy camp as the sun began to set. Along with three of her best soldiers, she had made her way to the enemy general's tent with the intent to rout the army or die in the attempt. In a fully pitched battle, the small band of dwarves under her command wouldn't stand a chance against this great host. However, if her group of elite soldiers followed her orders to the letter, they had a chance to cut off the head of the army before it came to battle. For what could be her final mission, she gripped her battleaxe and gave the order to move out.": "在夕阳开始下山时，一位头发斑白的矮人审视着敌营。她和三名最优秀的士兵一起，前往敌将的帐篷，意图摧毁敌军或在尝试中殉难。在一场全面的战斗中，她指挥的这支小型矮人部队无法与庞大的敌军抗衡。然而，如果她的精英士兵团队严格按照她的命令行事，他们有机会在交战之前斩断敌军首领的头颅。对于可能是她最后一次任务，她紧握战斧，下令出发。",
	"The dwarven lord ordered his soldiers to form ranks as the uncountable horde of horrors poured forth from the tunnel ahead. He positioned his platoon of elite warriors in the final tunnel before the entrance of his clan's great city. His clan had delved too greedily and they had freed something from the depths below. The lord muttered a final prayer and prepared to lead his men to their deaths, hopefully giving the rest of his clan time to escape the unstoppable horde of monstrosities.": "矮人领主命令他的士兵排成队列，当无数的恐怖之群从前方的隧道涌出时。他将自己的精英战士小队部署在他族群伟大城市入口前的最后一个隧道。他的族群贪得无厌，释放了深渊之下的某种东西。领主喃喃念了最后一声祈祷，准备带领他的士兵赴死，希望能给族群其他成员逃脱那不可阻挡的怪物之群提供时间。",
	"The flamboyant elven gladiator paused for a brief moment, basking in the cheers of the crowd. He remembered his first gladiatorial match in the underground arena, surrounded by drunken pirates and slavers. Now he performed for the king and queen amidst the bustle of the largest metropolis in the kingdom. After savoring the moment, he whirled about and plunged his gilded spear into his opponent's heart, ending what would be his final fight and earning him his freedom.": "那个华丽的(Elven)角斗士停顿了一会儿，沐浴在观众的欢呼声中。他记得自己在地下竞技场的第一场角斗赛，周围是醉醺醺的海盗和奴隶贩子。如今，他在王国最大都市的喧嚣中为国王和王后表演。在享受这一刻后，他急转身，将镶金的矛刺入对手的心脏，结束了这场将成为他最后一战的比赛，赢得了自由。",
	"A lithe wood elf quietly led her hunting party through the underbrush of the great wood. They had tracked their foe, a great two-headed troll, for almost two days. As it rested in a clearing, she gave the signal and her fellow hunters fanned out around the beast, blending in with the natural landscape. On her mark, the hunting party lunged forward with their spears, and the troll was felled before it could react.": "一位纤瘦的木精灵悄无声息地带领着她的狩猎队穿过茂密的大树丛。他们已经追踪他们的敌人，一头巨大的双头巨魔，将近两天了。当它在一个空地上休息时，她发出信号，她的狩猎伙伴们四散在野兽周围，与自然景观融为一体。在她的指示下，狩猎队员们用他们的长矛向前冲去，巨魔在还没来得及反应之前就被击倒了。",

Leaders to their core, a Warlord will make sure to understand the capabilities and weaknesses of their allies so they can help them to reach their true potential.": "独自一人，一个战争领主只是一个小威胁，但有忠诚的同伴来组织和指挥，最伟大的战争领主有能力推翻帝国。以精湛的战术运用和对战争的了解而闻名，一个战争领主能够发挥出他们盟友的真正潜力。作为领袖的核心，一个战争领主会确保了解他们盟友的能力和弱点，以便帮助他们发挥出真正的潜力。",
	"These exceptional strategists are able to step back and allow their allies to excel in combat. Though they are able to hold their own in battle, a warlord's true strength lies in the potent orders they issue to their allies. These insights push their comrades from mundane warriors to true heroes.": "这些杰出的战略家能够退居一旁，让他们的盟友在战斗中脱颖而出。虽然他们在战斗中也能自持一席之地，但军阀真正的力量在于他们向盟友发布的强有力命令。这些见解将他们的同伴从平凡的战士提升为真正的英雄。",
	"When creating your Warlord, consider where they learned to be a leader. Did they serve as the squire of a world-renowned general? Were they the star pupil of their kingdom's military academy? Or, did they slowly rise through the bloody ranks of a band of mercenaries, learning to lead through necessity?": "在创建你的军阀时，考虑他们是在哪里学会成为一名领袖的。他们是作为一位世界著名将军的侍从吗？还是他们是王国军事学院的状元？或者，他们是在一支雇佣兵团的血腥阶层中慢慢崛起，通过必要性学会领导的？",
	"Also, consider why your Warlord would lead others rather than improve their own individual martial skill. Do they see value in teamwork and coordination? Does their age or some other impairment prevent them from fighting on their own? Have they always had a cunning mind from a young age?": "此外，考虑一下你的军阀为什么要带领他人，而不是提高自己的个人武术技能。他们是否看到团队合作和协调的价值？他们的年龄或其他障碍是否阻止他们独自战斗？他们是否从小就拥有狡猾的头脑？",
