	"As the cloaked swordsman made hisway through the bustling marketplacehis eyes flashed green for a moment. Hecould see the unmistakable aura of arcanemagic surrounding the unassuming dwarfpretending to shop for wares. The warriorhad found his target. As he drew his runicblade, what had appeared to be a dwarvenpeasant only mere seconds before hadreverted to its true form. As the monstrousdevil lunged forward, the hooded swordsmangripped his blade and prepared for battle.": "当披着斗篷的剑客穿过熙熙攘攘的市场时，他的眼睛有一瞬间闪过了绿色。他可以看到无误的奥术光环围绕着那个正在买东西的不起眼的侏儒。战士找到了他的目标。当他拔出符文刀的时候，仅仅几秒钟前看起来还是一个矮人农民的东西已经恢复了它的真实形态。当这个怪物向前冲的时候，戴着头巾的剑客握紧了他的刀，准备战斗。",
	"The assassin watched in shock as the Dukewalked the streets below with only one guard byhis side. This would be the easiest job the killer forhire had ever worked. As the would-be assassin's bladedarted toward the Duke's exposed neck, glee turned tofear as the heavily armored guardian appeared where theDuke had been moments ago. Before the killer could reactto what had happened, a blade wreathed in emerald flame had pierced his chest, ending his wretched life of crime.": "刺客震惊地看着公爵走在下面的街道上，身边只有一个警卫。这将是这位杀手所做过的最简单的工作。当这个可能的刺客的刀子向公爵暴露的脖子刺去时，快乐变成了恐惧，全副武装的守护者出现在公爵刚才所在的地方。在杀手对所发生的事情作出反应之前，一把裹着翡翠色火焰的刀子刺穿了他的胸膛，结束了他可恶的犯罪生活。",
	"The halfling knelt before the three hooded figures that stood before her. She had spent nearly two years of her life searching for a member of this secret order, and now she had found three. Consumed by sorrow after the loss of her father at the hands of a wicked sorcerer, the young halfling swore she would do whatever it took to gain the power to exact her revenge. Now that the moment was at hand, she swore fealty to the secretive order, offering up her life in return for power.": "半身人跪在站在她面前的三个蒙面人面前。她花了将近两年的时间寻找这个秘密组织的成员，现在她找到了三个。在她的父亲死于一个邪恶的巫师之手后，这个年轻的半身人被悲伤所吞噬，她发誓要不惜一切代价获得力量来实现她的复仇。现在时机已到，她向这个神秘的组织宣誓效忠，用自己的生命来换取权力。",
	"Known by many names throughout the multiverse, those who are able to wield both sword and spell are collectively known as magi. Rather than dedicate their lives to studying arcane magic or mastery of martial technique, these warriors choose a middle path. Though they may never command the earth-shattering magic of an archmage, or go toe to toe with a true master of the blade, a magus is able to master a unique form of arcane combat only used by the members of their order.": "在整个多元宇宙中有许多名字，那些能够同时挥舞剑和法术的人被统称为魔法师。这些战士没有把他们的生命献给研究奥术魔法或掌握武术技巧，而是选择了一条中间道路。虽然他们可能永远不会像大法师那样指挥惊天动地的魔法，也不会和真正的刀剑大师交手，但魔法师能够掌握一种只有他们的成员才会使用的独特的奥术战斗形式。",

	"The magic of the magi is not something everyone can learn. Over time, these arcane warriors have organized themselves into clandestine societies, content to operate in the shadows.

While some orders are more secretive than others, nearly every order of magi is thought to be nothing more than legend and myths to most of the common folk.": "魔法师的魔法不是每个人都能学会的。随着时间的推移，这些神秘的战士们将自己组织成秘密的社团，满足于在暗处活动。潜在的魔法师通常在年轻时就被发现，只有在他们证明了自己的技能和奉献精神后才会被纳入一个组织。虽然有些教团比其他教团更神秘，但几乎每一个教团对大多数普通人来说，都被认为只是传说和神话。",
	"As magi rise through the ranks of their secret society, they are expected to infiltrate and form relationships with those who wield power. They often set themselves up as personal advisors, guards, and consorts to influential nobles, powerful archmages, and wealthy merchants. Though magi may form relationships, their primary loyalty is always to their order.": "随着魔法师在其秘密社团中的地位不断提高，他们被期望渗透并与那些掌握权力的人建立关系。他们经常把自己设定为有影响力的贵族、强大的大法师和富有的商人的私人顾问、护卫和妃子。虽然魔法师可以建立关系，但他们的主要忠诚度始终是对他们的秩序。",
	"hose who pursue life as a magus often give up everything in order to be accepted and trained by a master. What motivates your magus?

Or, do you simply desire to gain skill with both sword and sorcery?": "追求魔法师生活的软管往往放弃一切，以便被大师接受和训练。是什么激励着你的魔法师？你是否一直对知识和技能有一种难以抑制的渴求？你的一个亲人被一个邪恶的施法者杀害了，使你走上了复仇之路？或者，你只是想获得剑和巫术的技能？",
