Her benefactor had paid her a large sum to locate this forgotten place, and after weeks of pouring over ancient maps, she had pieced together the location of the temple. Now, she had a decision to make. If she reported the location of the temple to her benefactor, it would be ruthlessly stripped of valuables. But, if she kept the location hidden, she could preserve the long-forgotten knowledge contained within. For a savant, knowledge is more precious than any sum of gold.": "修长的(elf)用斗篷的角角擦拭着眼镜，周围的尘土在她周围落定。她的( benefactor)付给她一大笔钱来找到这个被遗忘的地方，经过数周研究古老地图，她终于拼凑出了寺庙的位置。现在，她需要做出一个决定。如果她向( benefactor)报告寺庙的位置，那么它将被无情地剥夺财宝。但是，如果她保密这个位置，她就能保存其中蕴含的被遗忘的知识。对于一个学者来说，知识比任何金钱都更宝贵。",

It was the tenth day of the siege, and the graying warrior knew that no reinforcements were coming to their rescue.

He stood up, and for what could be the last time, he tightened his belt and drew his sword.": "这位年迈的人类战士默默地评估着他指挥下的士兵。他们筋疲力尽，几乎耗尽了补给。这是围困的第十天，这位头发斑白的战士知道没有援军会来解救他们。他已经太老了，无法在战斗中发挥太大作用，但如果他的士兵毫不犹豫地听从他的命令，他们或许还有存活的机会。他站起身来，也许这是最后一次，他拉紧腰带，拔出了剑。",
	"A young dwarf bent over his unconscious comrade in the midst of battle, his hands shook as he examined his brother's wounds. His clan had spent a small fortune sending him to study at the finest university in the land. All the hours spent in lectures and libraries, all for this moment. He thought back to his lessons and began to dress his brother's wounds.": "一名年轻的矮人在战斗中弯下腰，他颤抖着双手检查着他昏迷的同伴的伤口。他的族人花费了一大笔财富送他去全国最好的大学学习。所有在讲堂和图书馆度过的时光，都是为了这一刻。他回想起自己的课程，开始给他的兄弟包扎伤口。",

	"When creating a savant, consider their upbringing and level of formal education. Were they the star pupil of the finest university in the land, or did they come from poverty, fighting for any scrap of knowledge they could get their hands on? Also, consider why your savant relies only on their intellect, rather than the arcane or the patronage of a higher power.": "在创建一个智者时，考虑他们的成长背景和正规教育水平。他们是大陆上最优秀大学的学霸，还是来自贫困家庭，为了获取任何一丁点知识而艰难奋斗？此外，考虑一下为什么你的智者只依赖自己的智慧，而不是奥术或更高力量的庇护。",

For an Archaeologist, the best way to improve the present is to learn from both the mistakes and innovations of the past.": "专门研究被遗忘的文明、古老地点和未知之地，考古学家们将知识之光带到世界上黑暗和危险的地方。他们尽力揭示被遗忘已久的智慧，常常会感到与他们研究的文明有一种悲伤的亲缘关系，并竭尽全力不去破坏或冒犯它们的记忆。对于一名考古学家来说，改善现在的最佳方式是从过去的错误和创新中学习。",
