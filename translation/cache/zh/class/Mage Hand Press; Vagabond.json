	"Peals of thunder and sheets of rainfall batter a lone traveler on a forest road. In a flash of lightning, a half-dozen hooded bandits emerge from the treeline, brandishing crossbows and shouting demands. Weary but unfazed, the traveler draws a longsword and plunges into an exotic stance, sweeping through the brigands with terrible speed.": "一阵雷声和倾盆大雨袭击着一名独自旅行的旅人在森林小路上。在闪电的闪烁中，半打蒙面强盗从树林中冲出来，挥舞着弩弓并高声要求。疲惫但镇定的旅人拔出长剑，采取一种奇特的姿势，以可怕的速度扫荡着强盗。",
	"On another road, caustic bile drips from a behir's teeth as it surveys its latest victim—its next meal. The elf adorned in patchwork armor, beaten and bruised, snaps awake and seizes a cracked floor tile with both hands. Wild desperation in her eyes, the elf drives the tile into the behir's skull over and over, carving a path towardsalvation.": "在另一条道路上，一只巨蛇的牙齿滴下腐蚀性的胆汁，它审视着最新的受害者——它的下一顿饭。那个身穿拼接盔甲、遍体鳞伤的精灵猛然醒来，双手抓住一块破裂的地砖。她眼中充满了疯狂的绝望，将地砖一次又一次地砸向巨蛇的头骨，开辟一条通往拯救的道路。",
	"No matter where they're going or what they're running from, a vagabond's only home is the open road. The peril of their journey would leave most dead on the roadside, but the vagabond endures, driven by a desperate will to survive and a mastery of fierce combat maneuvers.": "无论他们要去哪里，或者他们在逃避什么，游荡者唯一的家园就是漫长的道路。他们旅途中的危险会让大多数人倒在路边，但游荡者却坚持不懈，被绝望的求生意志和对激烈战斗技巧的掌握所驱使。",
	"Vagabonds are constantly on the road, drifting between taverns and backwoods villages on an endless, wandering journey. Some choose the unrooted lifestyle, but many more were driven from their homes, never to return. Whether a particular vagabond is a dangerous fugitive, penniless vagrant, or devout pilgrim is a secret known only to them. After all, anonymity is a precious boon for the road-weary.": "流浪者经常在路上漂泊，漫无目的地穿梭于酒馆和偏远村庄之间，进行永无止境的漫游之旅。有些人选择了无根之生活，但更多的人被迫离开家园，永远无法返回。一个特定的流浪者是危险的逃犯、一名一贫如洗的流浪汉，还是虔诚的朝圣者，只有他们自己才知道。毕竟，匿名对于那些疲惫的旅人来说是一种宝贵的恩赐。",
	"Many vagabonds prefer to travel alone, but just as many find themselves in the company of adventurers. There is safety in numbers, after all, and a lifestyle of questing and dungeon-delving rarely lets one settle in one place for long.": "许多流浪者更喜欢独自旅行，但同样也有许多人发现自己与冒险者为伍。毕竟，人多力量大，而追求探险和探险很少让人长时间停留在一个地方。",
	"The long miles of their journeys instill a feeling of desperation in vagabonds. They're desperate to continue, to reach their destinations. But most of all, they're desperate to survive. When a vagabond is backed into a corner, they fight like a crazed animal, slashing wildly, biting and scratching if necessary. But they also learn more practical tools for survival.": "他们漫长的旅程让流浪者感到绝望。他们渴望继续前行，抵达目的地。但最重要的是，他们渴望生存。当一个流浪者被逼入绝境时，他们会像疯狂的动物一样拼命反抗，疯狂地挥舞着，必要时还会咬和抓。但他们也学会了更实用的生存技能。",
	"Vagabonds are experts at performing maneuvers picked up from traveling companions and warriors they encounter on their globe-spanning travels. Those that fail to master these exotic fighting styles end their wanderings early, dead on the roadside.": "流浪者是在环球旅行中从同伴和战士那里学到各种技巧的专家。那些未能掌握这些异国格斗风格的人很快就会在路边死去。",
	"When other means fail, vagabonds can always find short-term employment as sellswords or bodyguards, for few can match their experience in perilous combat with equal vigor.": "当其他手段失败时，流浪者们总是可以作为雇佣兵或保镖找到短期就业，因为很少有人能够与他们在危险战斗中的经验相匹敌。",
	"As you create your vagabond, consider why your character has taken to the road. Do you one day wish to return home? Consult the options in the {@classFeature Wanderer's Secret|Vagabond|MHP:VB|1} feature for ideas. Also consider how your journey has shaped your character so far. Do you take joy in finding companionship wherever you travel, or do you prefer anonymity underneath a drawn hood? Are you roadweary from your travels or does seeing a new horizon invigorate you each day?": "在塑造你的流浪者角色时，考虑一下为什么你的角色选择了漫游。你是否有一天希望回到家乡？可以参考{@classFeature Wanderer's Secret|Vagabond|MHP:VB|1}特性中的选项来获取一些想法。同时考虑一下你的旅程如何迄今塑造了你的角色。你是否喜欢在旅途中随处寻找伙伴，或者更喜欢戴着帽子保持匿名？你是否因为旅行而感到疲惫不堪，还是每天看到新的地平线都能让你精神振奋？",
	"Who taught you how to wield a weapon, and who trained you in the deeper arts of battle tactics? You might be self-trained, learning through near-death experiences and careful observation of others. Or you might have had a tutor, even several of them, whose teachings have resulted in your unique fighting style. Were you a dangerous combatant before you left home, or are your fearsome maneuvers a survival mechanism learned on the road?": "谁教会了你如何挥舞武器，谁训练了你更深层次的战术技能？你可能是自学成才，通过濒死经历和仔细观察他人来学习。或者你可能有导师，甚至有几位导师，他们的教导导致了你独特的战斗风格。在离开家之前，你是一个危险的战士，还是你的可怕动作是在旅途中学到的生存机制？",
	"You can make a vagabond quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on a combination of archery and finesse weapons. Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Charisma if you plan to take a subclass, such as Mage Brand, that employs spellcasting or other magical abilities. Finally, choose any background, preferably one that ties into your choice for your Wanderer's Secret feature.": "按照以下建议，您可以快速创建一个流浪者。首先，根据您是想专注于近战武器还是弓箭和灵巧武器的组合，将力量或敏捷作为您的最高能力值。您的次高分应该是体质，或者如果您打算选择一个子职业，比如法师印记，那么就应该是魅力，因为这些子职业会使用咒语或其他魔法能力。最后，选择任何背景，最好是与您对“漫游者秘密”特性的选择相关的背景。",
	"Searing runes and arcane geometry into one's skin is an agonizing practice known as spellbranding. Though it was once used by tyrannical giants to imbue their conscripts with a mote of magical potential, spellbranding has long since been disparaged in polite society. However, a few that are willing and desperate enough to burn themselves with magical runes might still utilize that magic today. The so-called \"Mage Brands\" need none of a mage's intellect or a priest's faith; they need only tenacity and atolerance for pain.": "将灼热的符文和奥术几何图案刻在皮肤上是一种极其痛苦的做法，被称为咒印。尽管曾经被暴虐的巨人用来赋予他们的士兵一丝魔法潜能，但咒印早已在有礼貌的社会中受到唾弃。然而，仍有一些愿意和绝望到足够程度以用魔法符文烙伤自己的人可能会利用这种魔法。这些所谓的“法师印记”不需要法师的智慧或神职人员的信仰；他们只需要坚韧不拔和对疼痛的忍耐力。",
	"Starting when you set out on this road at 3rd level, you have been taught the agonizing magic of spellbranding.": "从你在3级时开始踏上这条道路时，你已经学会了令人痛苦的法术印记魔法。",

	"By searing arcane symbols into your flesh, you gain the ability to harness certain spells. You gain two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Branded Spells table. At 6th level, you gain two 2nd-level spells of your choice from the table.": "通过将奥术符号烙印在你的肌肤上，你获得了利用特定咒语的能力。你可以从《烙印咒语》表中选择两个1级咒语。当你达到6级时，你可以从表中选择两个2级咒语。",

In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a branded spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.": "魅力是你的品牌法术的施法能力，因此当一个法术提到你的施法能力时，你会使用你的魅力。此外，当你施放一个品牌法术并设定豁免 DC 时，以及进行攻击检定时，你会使用你的魅力修正值。",
	"Starting at 6th level, due to your spellbrands, you can smell and taste the lingering evidence of magic. You can instantly identify a creature that has cast a spell within the last 24 hours. If you touch an object, you can detect if it is a magic item, but not its properties.": "从6级开始，由于你的法术印记，你可以嗅到和尝到魔法的残留证据。你可以立即识别出在过去24小时内施放过法术的生物。如果你触摸一个物体，你可以检测出它是否是一件魔法物品，但不能知道它的具体属性。",

	"Beginning at 14th level, when a spell is cast that targets you, or you are in the area of a spell's effect, you can temporarily learn that spell if it is of 5th lever or lower, marking it on your skin as a faint spellbrand. You can't use this ability to learn a spell that had no effect on you, even if it forced you to make a saving throw against it.": "从14级开始，当有一个以你为目标的法术被施放，或者你处于一个法术效果范围内时，你可以暂时学习该法术，前提是它是5级或更低级的法术，并将其标记在你的皮肤上，形成一个淡淡的法术印记。你不能利用这个能力来学习对你没有产生任何影响的法术，即使它迫使你对其进行豁免才能。",

	"Brigands encompass all manner of highwaymen, pirates, raiders, and other dastardly folk. No tactic, no matter how heinous, is off the table for a band of brigands, whether that means roadside ambushes or taking hostages at knifepoint. Ultimately, most brigands are driven to their thievery through desperation; it is fitting that they leave others as few choices as were afforded to them.": "强盗包括各种强盗、海盗、掠夺者和其他恶棍。对于一群强盗来说，没有任何卑劣手段是不能采取的，无论是路边伏击还是持刀劫持人质。最终，大多数强盗之所以走上盗窃之路，是因为绝望；他们留给他人的选择很少，这是合适的。",
	"Starting when you set out on this road at 3rd level, you are always prepared to strike first.

You have three-quarters cover from attacks while holding a creature hostage. Attacks that miss you hit the hostage instead.": "当你扣留一只生物时，你可以在对该生物的盟友进行的魅力检定中加上你的战斗骰({@skill Intimidation})。扣留生物时，你对攻击获得三分之四掩护。未命中你的攻击会击中扣留的生物。",

You can roll each damage die up to a maximum of four times.": "从14级开始，无情对你来说是第二天性。当你用近战武器攻击命中一只生物并在任何伤害骰上掷出最大数字时，你可以再次掷那个骰子并将其加到这次攻击的伤害中，如果再次掷出最大数字，则继续掷，依此类推。你最多可以掷每个伤害骰四次。",
