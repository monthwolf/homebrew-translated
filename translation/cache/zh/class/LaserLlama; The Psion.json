	"As the elderly human watched his apprentice struggle to lift the pebble with his mind, he thought back to his youth, and the years of training it had taken to unlock his own psionic gift. After traveling the world he had realized that true enlightenment was only found within, and he retreated to the cave he called home. As his remaining years had grown fewer in number, he had taken the young lad who now stood before him as an apprentice to pass on all he had learned.": "当这位年迈的人类看着他的学徒挣扎着用意念举起那块小石头时，他回想起自己的青年时代，以及为解锁自己的超能力所花费的多年训练。在周游世界后，他意识到真正的启示只能从内心找到，于是他退隐到他所称之为家的洞穴中。随着他剩下的岁月越来越少，他收了眼前的年轻小伙子为徒，传授他所学到的一切。",
	"Selected at birth due to her psionic potential, the young elf had been molded into the perfect assassin. As held her latest mark firmly beneath her, the baron let out a soft cry as a blade of pure psionic energy pierced his heart. The next morning, the baron's guards would find him dead, though the cause of his untimely demise would forever remain a mystery.": "因为她潜在的超能力，这位年轻的精灵在出生时就被选中，被塑造成完美的刺客。当她将最新的目标牢牢地压在身下时，男爵发出了一声轻轻的呼喊，一道纯粹的超能力之刃刺穿了他的心脏。第二天早晨，男爵的卫兵们会发现他已经死了，尽管他的突然死亡原因将永远成为一个谜。",
	"The young dwarf fled into the forest, consumed with the terror of what he'd done. For as long as he could remember, there was {@i something} within his mind that h struggled to keep bottled up. That morning, in a moment of weakness, his focus slipped, and a torrent of wild psionic power erupted from within him. He had awoken in the rubble of his home to find his family buried in the ruins. Deep down, he had always known this power would break free. He would live his life as a hermit in the wild where he couldn't harm anyone else.": "年轻的矮人逃进森林，心中充满了对自己所做之事的恐惧。在他记忆中的很长一段时间里，他心中一直有{@i something}，他努力压抑着。那天早晨，在一时的软弱中，他的注意力松懈了，一股狂野的精神力量从他体内爆发出来。他醒来时，家园已经变成了废墟，他的家人被埋在废墟中。他心底深处，他一直知道这股力量终将挣脱。他决定在荒野中过着隐士的生活，以免再伤害他人。",
	"Whether through years of practice, or a once in a generation innate talent, Psions learn to manipulate the world with the wondrous power of their minds. Drawing upon the mystical power within, they can communicate without speaking, move objects, alter their physical bodies, and even manifest spells. Relying solely on mastery of their mind, Psions can perform feats thought impossible, even by the most erudite Wizards and devout Clerics. For Psions, it is a point of great pride that they can produce wonders without the help of external power.": "无论是通过多年的实践，还是一代人中难得一见的天赋，（Psions）（异能者）学会用他们惊人的心灵力量操纵世界。借助内在的神秘力量，他们可以在不说话的情况下进行交流，移动物体，改变自己的身体，甚至施展法术。（Psions）（异能者）仅依靠对自己心灵的掌握，可以完成被认为是不可能的壮举，即使是最博学的巫师和虔诚的牧师也无法做到。对于（Psions）（异能者）来说，他们可以在没有外部力量帮助的情况下创造奇迹，这是一种巨大的骄傲。",
	"Due to their potential, Psions are often misunderstood and feared by the common folk. If they don't learn to control their power, their strange abilities can cause them to be shunned and hated by those around them. Most Psions reveal their power only when necessary, and are hesitant to trust others.": "由于他们的潜力，（Psions）通常被普通民众误解和害怕。如果他们不学会控制自己的力量，他们奇特的能力可能会导致他们被周围的人排斥和憎恨。大多数（Psions）只在必要时展示他们的力量，并且不愿轻易信任他人。",
	"If they are lucky, potential Psions are discovered by a master and taken away from their home to hone their psionic power in seclusion. No matter their philosophy on life, every Psion holds it as their sacred duty to one day take on an apprentice with the psionic gift and teach them to control their power, passing on everything they themselves have learned.": "如果他们幸运的话，潜在的灵能者会被一位大师发现，并被带离家园，以独自磨练他们的灵能力。无论他们对生活持何种哲学观，每位灵能者都将这视为自己的神圣职责，有朝一日接受具有灵能天赋的学徒，并教导他们控制自己的力量，传授一切他们自己所学到的知识。",
	"A Psion's master and how they are trained has great effect on the nature of their abilities. For some, their gift is honed through years of practice and meditation. Others are trained to use their mystic abilities to morph their bodies into deadly weapons. And for the rare few who are never discovered by a master, or attempt to stifle their power, they risk outbursts of wild psionic energy that can have devastating effects.": "一位（Psion）的导师以及他们的训练方式对他们的能力性质有着巨大影响。对于一些人来说，他们的天赋是通过多年的练习和冥想来磨练的。其他人则接受训练，利用他们的神秘能力将自己的身体变形成致命的武器。对于那些从未被导师发现或试图扼杀自己力量的少数人来说，他们面临着野蛮的超能能量爆发，可能会造成毁灭性后果。",
	"When creating your Psion, consider how you first discovered your psionic potential. Was it in a moment of pure emotion? Or did you realize your power through peaceful meditation? Did you have a mystical experience that awoke something asleep inside of you? Whatever your experience, the first time that a Psion realizes the true potential of their mind will have a lasting impact on how they view and wield their power.": "在创建你的灵能者时，考虑你是如何首次发现自己的超能力的。是在纯情感的瞬间吗？还是通过平静的冥想意识到自己的力量？是有一次神秘的经历唤醒了你内心沉睡的某种东西吗？无论你的经历是什么，第一次灵能者意识到自己心灵的真正潜力将对他们如何看待和运用自己的力量产生持久影响。",
	"Also, consider your psionic master. Did another Psion take you under their wing, teaching you to control your wondrous power as their apprentice? Or, did you learn to wield this mysterious inner power on your own? How do you feel about your psionic gift? Is it a point of great pride? Something that separates you from the commoners? Or, do you view your gift as a curse to be hidden and used in the direst situations?": "另外，考虑一下你的灵能大师。是另一位先知将你收为徒弟，教导你控制你那神奇的力量吗？还是你自己学会驾驭这种神秘的内在力量？你对自己的灵能天赋有什么感觉？是一种巨大的骄傲吗？是一种让你与普通人区分开来的东西吗？还是你认为这份天赋是一种需要隐藏，并只在最危急情况下使用的诅咒？",

	"The psionic power of your mind is represented by a pool of Psi Points. You have a number of Psi Points equal to 1 + your Psion level. To manifest one of the Psion spells you know, you must expend a number of Psi Points equal to the level of the spell (0 for cantrips), and you regain all of your expended Psi Points each time you finish a short or long rest.": "你的心灵异能力由一组灵能点表示。你拥有的灵能点数等于1 + 你的先知（Psion）等级。要施展你所知道的先知法术之一，你必须消耗与该法术等级相等的灵能点数（对于零级法术则为0），每当你完成一次短休或长休时，你会恢复所有已消耗的灵能点数。",

	"Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Psion spells since your magic is drawn from the power of your mind. You use your Intelligence when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Intelligence modifier when you set the saving throw DC or make an attack roll for a Psion spell.": "智力是你的（Psion）法术的施法能力，因为你的魔法源自你的心灵力量。当一个法术提到你的施法能力时，你使用你的智力。当你为（Psion）法术设置豁免 DC 或进行攻击骰时，你也使用你的智力修正值。",
