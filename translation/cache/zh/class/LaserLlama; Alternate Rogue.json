	"Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.": "一名半身人示意她的同伴等待，小心翼翼地穿过地牢大厅。她把耳朵贴在门上，然后拿出一套工具，在眨眼间就打开了锁。接着，她消失在阴影中，当她的战士朋友向前踢开门时。",

When their target/u2014a notorious slaver/u2014passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.": "一个人潜伏在小巷的阴影中，而他的同伙则在准备伏击中扮演她的角色。当他们的目标——一个臭名昭著的奴隶贩子——经过小巷时，同伙大喊一声，贩子前来调查，刺客的刀锋在他还来不及发出声音之前割断了他的喉咙。",

	"Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match.

	"When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength.

Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.": "在战斗中，盗贼更注重狡诈而非蛮力。一名盗贼宁愿进行一次精准的打击，将攻击准确地放在对方最脆弱的地方，而不是用一连串的攻击来消耗对手。盗贼几乎有一种超自然的本领来避开危险，而一些人学会了魔法技巧来补充他们的其他能力。",
	"Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families.

	"As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law.

Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.": "作为冒险者，盗贼们在法律的两边都有人。有些是彻头彻尾的罪犯，决定在财宝堆中寻找财富，而另一些则选择冒险生活来逃避法律的制裁。有些人学会并完善了他们的技能，专门潜入古代遗迹和隐藏的地下室寻找财宝。",
	"As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past/u2014or present?

Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?": "在创建你的(*rogue*)盗贼角色时，考虑角色与法律的关系。你是否有犯罪记录—过去或现在？你是在逃离法律还是在逃离愤怒的盗贼行会头目？还是你离开行会寻找更大的风险和更丰厚的回报？是贪婪驱使你冒险，还是其他欲望或理想？",
	"What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career?

	"You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation or plan to take up the Arcane Trickster archetype. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the {@background charlatan} background.": "按照以下建议，您可以快速创建一个游荡者。首先，敏捷应该是您最高的能力值。如果您想在调查方面表现出色，或者打算选择奥术戏法师职业分支，那么智力应该是您的次高能力值。如果您打算强调欺骗和社交互动，那么选择魅力。其次，选择{@background charlatan}背景。",

	"Some rogues who turn to adventuring are former criminals who have decided that dodging monsters is preferable to remaining one step ahead of the law. Others are professional killers in search of a profitable application of their talents between contracts. Some simply love the thrill of overcoming any challenge that stands in their way.": "一些转而从事冒险的流氓是以前的罪犯，他们决定躲避怪物比继续逃避法律更可取。另一些是职业杀手，在合同之间寻找能够利用他们天赋的有利机会。还有一些人只是热爱战胜一切阻碍的挑战所带来的刺激。",
	"On adventures, a rogue is likely to mix an outwardly cautious approach/u2014few rogues enjoy combat/u2014with a ravenous hunger for loot.

	"A rogue's guilty pleasure could be the acquisition of a physical item, something to be experienced, or a way of conducting oneself at certain times. One rogue might not be able to pass up any loot made of silver, for instance, even if said loot is hanging around the neck of a castle guard. Another one can't go through a day in the city without lifting a purse or two, just to keep in practice.": "一个游荡者的罪恶快感可能是获得一个实物，某种体验，或者在某些时候的行为方式。一个游荡者可能无法抵挡银制战利品，即使这些战利品挂在城堡卫兵的脖子上。另一个可能无法在城市里度过一天而不偷几个钱包，只是为了保持技艺。",
