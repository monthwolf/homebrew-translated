He tells them that he awoke trapped in some sort of cocoon, with giant birds fighting over him.

	"In short, Yartar is a fortified fishing and barge building town set on the banks of the Dessarin River. It is divided into a citadel on the west bank, and the town proper on the east bank, with a sturdy stone bridge between them.

	"{@creature Lord Artan Rossolio|KG|Artan's} home is a two-story building on the outskirts of town. Large and old, fenced in and foreboding, the Rossolio manor reeks of wealth and power. Inside, the manor is decorated with lavish paintings, tapestries, busts and statues, the floors are polished mahogany where they aren't covered by massive carpets, and gaudy chandeliers hang from the high ceilings.": "{@creature Lord Artan Rossolio|KG|Artan's}家是一座位于城镇郊外的两层建筑。这座古老而宽敞的罗索里奥庄园被围墙环绕，给人一种威严和权力的感觉。庄园内装饰着奢华的画作、挂毯、半身像和雕塑，地板是抛光的红木，除非被厚重的地毯覆盖，而华丽的枝形吊灯悬挂在高高的天花板上。",
	"The Rossolio manor is guarded by 12 elite guards (LN and N male and female {@creature veteran|MM|veterans}), which take orders from the unassuming 'butler' {@creature Khemed|KG} (N male assassin).

	"As {@creature Lord Artan Rossolio|KG|Artan} bows his head and retreats to his chambers, {@creature Lady Dezhia Rossolio|KG|Dezhia} turns her attention to the party. She demands they explain what happened to {@creature Lord Artan Rossolio|KG|Artan}, how they found him and how they got him to Yartar. Regardless of what promises {@creature Lord Artan Rossolio|KG|Artan} has made, she'll refuse to pay anything more than 100 gold pieces for the party's aid in returning {@creature Lord Artan Rossolio|KG|Artan}. However, she'll entice the party with a job offer:": "当{@creature Lord Artan Rossolio|KG|Artan}低头退回自己的房间时，{@creature Lady Dezhia Rossolio|KG|Dezhia}将注意力转向了聚会。她要求他们解释发生了什么事情导致{@creature Lord Artan Rossolio|KG|Artan}，他们是如何找到他的，以及是如何将他带到雅塔尔的。无论{@creature Lord Artan Rossolio|KG|Artan}做出了什么承诺，她都不会支付超过100金币作为对于聚会帮助{@creature Lord Artan Rossolio|KG|Artan}返回的报酬。然而，她会用一份工作提议来吸引聚会：",

	"The Waterbaron of Yartar, {@creature Waterbaron Nestra Ruthiol|KG|Nestra Ruthiol} (LE female human noble), resides in the Waterbaron's Hall which sits at the center of Yartar. It's a large, squat building with a vaulted roof. Within are all sort of meeting rooms, a vast feast hall, and the Waterbaron's grand chambers.

	"If the party asks about disappearing nobles, {@creature Waterbaron Nestra Ruthiol|KG|Nestra} immediately seems interested in what they have to say. She's noted the disappearance of several nobles with concern, and she's suspicious that {@creature Khaspere Drylund|SKT|Lord Drylund} (the owner of {@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame}) is somehow involved. She thinks the lord is vying for her seat, and finds it suspicious that all the nobles who've gone missing so far, are from families that back her as Waterbaron. She finds herself unable to act on the suspicions, though, because she doesn't have sufficient proof to warrant a thorough investigation into {@creature Khaspere Drylund|SKT|Lord Drylund}. Any brash move risks tipping her hand and turning more nobles against her.": "如果队伍询问关于失踪贵族的事情，{@creature Waterbaron Nestra Ruthiol|KG|Nestra} 立刻对他们所说的感兴趣。她已经注意到几位贵族的失踪，感到担忧，并怀疑{@creature Khaspere Drylund|SKT|Lord Drylund}(%2%的所有者)可能与此有关。她认为这位领主正在争夺她的位置，并发现所有迄今失踪的贵族都是支持她作为水男爵的家族成员，这让她感到可疑。然而，她发现自己无法采取行动来调查{@creature Khaspere Drylund|SKT|Lord Drylund}，因为她没有足够的证据来证明。任何鲁莽的举动都会冒着暴露底牌并让更多贵族对她产生敌意的风险。",
	"She doesn't tell the party all of this, of course, but instead poses as a benevolent leader, concerned for the safety and well-being of the people she governs. She can provide the following information:": "当然，她并没有把所有这些都告诉给冒险小组，而是假装成一个仁慈的领袖，关心统治的人民的安全和福祉。她可以提供以下信息：",
	"Three nobles have gone missing over the last few weeks. {@creature Lord Artan Rossolio|KG|Artan Rossolio}, Jakkob Dawnflower and Timothy Salzberg. All are young men.": "在过去几周中，已经有三位贵族失踪了。{@creature Lord Artan Rossolio|KG|Artan Rossolio}，雅各布·黎明花和蒂莫西·索尔兹伯格。他们都是年轻男子。",
	"Timothy was a regular at {@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame} and Jakkob might've been involved with the Hand of Yartar, or so the rumors say.": "Timothy是{@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame}的常客，而Jakkob可能与(Yartar之手)有牵连，至少传言如此。",
	"No clues have been found about where any of them are, and all seem to have disappeared during the night.": "关于他们的下落没有任何线索被发现，所有人似乎在夜间消失了。",
	"If the party seem hesitant to investigate, or ask why she doesn't get her Shields to look into the matter, {@creature Waterbaron Nestra Ruthiol|KG|Nestra} says that she can't legally investigate {@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame} with so little actual evidence, and ask the party to get to the bottom of this for her. She'll pay them a 100 gold pieces up front for the effort, but warns the party that they do not officially work for her or the city, and if they are caught doing anything illicit, or take up arms against the Shields or any other of Yartar's citizens, she'll deny having ever met them and punish them according to harsh Yartarian law.": "如果冒险小组似乎犹豫不决，或者询问为什么她不让她的护卫调查此事，{@creature Waterbaron Nestra Ruthiol|KG|Nestra} 表示她不能仅凭如此少量的实际证据就进行合法调查{@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame}，并请冒险小组帮忙查清真相。她会预付给他们100金币作为酬劳，但警告冒险小组他们并不是正式为她或城市工作的，如果他们被抓到进行任何非法活动，或对抗护卫或亚塔尔其他市民，她会否认曾经见过他们，并根据亚塔尔严厉的法律对他们进行惩罚。",
	"If the party wants to speak with the all-female thieves' guild, they'll first have to find a representative. There's a couple of places that they might choose to visit for this: the Yartar market (called the Fishyard by the locals), the many alleys in the town, or one of the more sordid taverns, such as the Cointoss or the White-Winged Griffon.": "如果队伍想要和全女性的窃贼行会交谈，他们首先必须找到一个代表。有几个地方他们可以选择去寻找：当地人称之为鱼市场的(Yartar)市场，城镇中的许多小巷，或者一些更为肮脏的酒馆，比如(Cointoss)或(White-Winged Griffon)。",
	"Describing each of these locations are out of the scope of this document, but a thorough investigation should eventually allow the party to find one of the Hands. In an alley it's a woman beggar that looks a little too well-fed and sharp-eyed, in the taverns it's a stern-faced woman that everyone else seems to give a wide berth, and in the marketplace it's a lone woman who seems more focused on observing passersbys than buying anything.": "描述这些地点中的每一个超出了本文档的范围，但彻底调查最终应该能让队伍找到其中一个（The Hands）。在巷子里是一个女乞丐，看起来有点过于饱满和目光犀利，在酒馆里是一个面容严峻的女人，其他人似乎都避之不及，在市场上是一个独自一人的女人，似乎更专注于观察过路人而不是购买任何东西。",
	"If you prefer to do a montage-style-investigation, you can have each party member involved in the search roll a {@dc 15} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check each hour, to determine how long it takes them to find a Hand.": "如果你喜欢进行蒙太奇式调查，你可以让每个参与搜索的队伍成员每小时投掷一个 {@dc 15} 智力 ((Intelligence)) 检定，以确定他们找到一只 Hand 需要多长时间。",
	"Regardless where the party finds her, {@creature Scimitar Sally|KG} isn't keen on mincing words with well-armed strangers. She'll deny any open accusation about being a member of the Hand of Yartar, but might confess to 'knowing some people'. If the party cough up sufficient coin—a few platinum pieces at the least—and make a good Charisma roll or two, Sally will tell them some or all of what she knows, at your discretion (see the '{@adventure Scimitar Sally|KG|0|Scimitar Sally}' textbox). If the party tries to intimidate her, or becomes violent, she'll make her way to an alley (if she isn't already in one) where three {@creature Hand of Yartar|KG|Hands of Yartar} joins her against the party. If she's close to being defeated, she surrenders the information willingly, rather than die.": "无论派对在哪里找到{@creature Scimitar Sally|KG}，她都不喜欢与全副武装的陌生人绕弯子。她会否认任何公开指责她是雅塔之手的成员，但可能会承认“认识一些人”。如果派对支付足够的硬币——至少几枚白金币——并进行一两次成功的魅力检定，Sally会根据您的判断告诉他们她所知道的一部分或全部内容（请参阅“{@adventure Scimitar Sally|KG|0|Scimitar Sally}”文本框）。如果派对试图恐吓她，或变得暴力，她会前往一条小巷（如果她还不在那里），三名{@creature Hand of Yartar|KG|Hands of Yartar}会加入她对抗派对。如果她快被打败，她会自愿交出信息，而不是去死。",
	"{@adventure The Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame} and its notable inhabitants are detailed on {@adventure page 215 to 219 of the Storm King's Thunder campaign book|SKT|11|The Grand Dame}, so we won't go over the interior in great detail here.": "{@adventure The Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame}及其著名居民在{@adventure page 215 to 219 of the Storm King's Thunder campaign book|SKT|11|The Grand Dame}上有详细介绍，因此我们不会在这里详细介绍内部。",
	"The brief summary is that {@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame} is an ornately decorated riverboat owned by {@creature Khaspere Drylund|SKT|Lord Khaspere Drylund}, who is a member of the Kraken Society. In essence, {@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame} is a nightly, floating casino catering to rich nobles.": "简要概述是，{@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame} 是一艘由克拉肯协会成员{@creature Khaspere Drylund|SKT|Lord Khaspere Drylund} 拥有的装饰华丽的游船。本质上，{@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame} 是一个每晚在河上漂浮的赌场，专门迎合富有的贵族。",
	"The ship is captained by {@creature Nelvin Storn|KG|Nelvin Storn (LE male bandit captain}) who employs eight deckhands (NE male and female {@creature bandit|MM|bandits}), and the casino is overseen by {@creature Pow Ming|SKT} (N female mage). Around 80 people work on {@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame} (deckhands, rowers, chefs, servers, dealers, escorts and musicians) and {@dice 2d6 + 5} wealthy aristocrats or guild members spend their money there each night.": "这艘船由船长{@creature Nelvin Storn|KG|Nelvin Storn (LE male bandit captain}指挥，雇佣了八名甲板水手（NE男性和女性{@creature bandit|MM|bandits}），赌场由{@creature Pow Ming|SKT}（N女性法师）监督。大约有80人在{@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame}（水手、桨手、厨师、服务员、荷官、护卫和音乐家）工作，每晚有{@dice 2d6 + 5}富有的贵族或行会成员在那里消费。",
	"The only thing in this adventure that is really different from what is detailed in the book, is that {@creature Khaspere Drylund|SKT|Lord Khaspere Drylund} is away on business at this time. No one knows where, not even his most trusted employee {@creature Pow Ming|SKT}. He's supposed to come back in a week or two, and she's in charge while he is away. This change is made to avoid the party accidentally killing {@creature Khaspere Drylund|SKT|Lord Khaspere} or otherwise badly disrupt {@adventure Chapter 11 of Storm King's Thunder|SKT|11}.": "在这次冒险中，唯一与书中详细描述不同的事情是，此时{@creature Khaspere Drylund|SKT|Lord Khaspere Drylund}因公务在外。没有人知道他去了哪里，甚至他最信任的雇员{@creature Pow Ming|SKT}也不知道。他应该在一两周内回来，而在他离开期间，她负责管理。这个改变是为了避免冒险小组意外杀死{@creature Khaspere Drylund|SKT|Lord Khaspere}或者严重干扰{@adventure Chapter 11 of Storm King's Thunder|SKT|11}。",
	"As it is detailed on {@adventure Storm King's Thunder page 216|SKT|11|The Grand Dame}, there are four obvious ways to gain access to {@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame}. Enter by force, pose as a worker, pose as a wealthy guest or sneak onto the riverboat. Remember, the party doesn't have to all get onboard, and they don't have to all get onboard the same way. Any characters openly wearing weapons and armor won't be allowed onto the boat, under any circumstances.": "正如在{@adventure Storm King's Thunder page 216|SKT|11|The Grand Dame}中详细说明的那样，有四种明显的方法可以获得{@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame}的通行权。强行进入、假扮工人、假扮富裕的客人或潜入游船。请记住，整个队伍并不需要全部上船，也不必以相同的方式上船。任何公开佩戴武器和盔甲的角色都不会被允许登上船，无论任何情况。",
	"We'll cover each of the options below, expanding on the information in the campaign book, so that you're prepared for what your party might try. Be advised, posing as guests is probably the approach that'll get them the longest, and is easiest to pull off.": "我们将逐个讨论以下选项，详细阐述活动手册中的信息，以便您对您的团队可能尝试的方法有所准备。请注意，假扮客人可能是他们能够维持最长时间并且最容易实现的方法。",
	"Really, you should do everything to make sure your players do not choose this option. Drop hints like 'the captain and his deckhands seem ready for trouble' and maybe even remind the players that 'there's a guard station just at the end of the pier'.": "真的，你应该尽一切努力确保你的玩家不选择这个选项。像“船长和他的水手们似乎准备好闹事”这样的暗示，甚至可以提醒玩家“码头尽头就有一个警卫站”。",
	"If your party still end up in a fight with {@creature Nelvin Storn|KG|Nelvin} and his deckhands, or even {@creature Pow Ming|SKT}, you can have one of the characters spot the {@creature Atalia Nimmeryn|KG|Purple Lady} during the fight, standing a hundred feet away—perhaps at the end of the pier. She sees the character noticing her, and immediately starts walking away. This does two things: it's now no longer necessary to get onboard of {@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame}, and the party will have an excuse to quickly make their escape, instead of continuing a fight they shouldn't fight. It's not an optimal outcome, but it's better than nothing. If the party catch up to her, you can jump straight to '{@adventure Following the Purple Lady|KG|0|Following the Purple Lady}'.": "如果你的队伍最终还是与{@creature Nelvin Storn|KG|Nelvin}及其水手们发生冲突，甚至{@creature Pow Ming|SKT}，你可以让其中一名角色在战斗中发现{@creature Atalia Nimmeryn|KG|Purple Lady}，站在一百英尺外——也许在码头的尽头。她看到角色注意到她，立即开始走开。这样做有两个好处：现在不再需要登上{@adventure the Grand Dame|SKT|11|The Grand Dame}，而且队伍将有借口迅速逃跑，而不是继续一场他们不应该打的战斗。这并不是最理想的结果，但总比没有好。如果队伍追上她，你可以直接跳到'{@adventure Following the Purple Lady|KG|0|Following the Purple Lady}'。",
	"Workers usually arrive early in the evening, a few hours before the guests. {@creature Nelvin Storn|KG|Nelvin} has the workers line up, before going down the line one by one and appraising them.
