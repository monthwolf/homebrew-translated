	"The alchemist's furnace is a device that transmutes one material into another. Every transformation brings the material infinitesimally closer to perfection.": "炼金术士的熔炉是一种将一种物质转化为另一种的装置。每次转化都让物质无限接近完美。",
	"The function of the furnace is not simply the manufacture of potions, acids, alchemist's fire, and other alchemical concoctions. Those mundane pursuits can be accomplished on any workbench. The furnace exists to aid the alchemist in nothing less than unlocking the mysteries of the material and spiritual universe.": "熔炉的功能不仅仅是制造药水、酸类、炼金术火和其他炼金混合物。这些平凡的追求可以在任何工作台上完成。熔炉的存在是为了帮助炼金术士揭开物质和精神宇宙的奥秘。",
	"The discipline of alchemy is built upon rigorous reasoning. A common misunderstanding is that alchemists are interested in turning lead into gold in order to make themselves rich. Everyone would like to be rich, but that's not what drives alchemists in their quest for gold. Their reasoning goes like this:": "炼金术的学科建立在严谨的推理基础之上。一个常见的误解是，炼金术士想要将铅变成黄金以致富。每个人都想变得富有，但这并不是驱使炼金术士追求黄金的动机。他们的推理如下：",
	"Lead is a base metal. Although it's useful, it's ugly and has little value. This is because lead is imperfect and impure.": "铅是一种碱金属。尽管它有用，但它很丑并且价值低。这是因为铅是不完美和不纯的。",
	"Gold is a noble metal. It's beautiful and has tremendous value. This is because gold is pure and nearly perfect.": "黄金是一种贵重金属。它美丽且价值巨大。这是因为黄金纯净且几乎完美。",
	"If lead could be cleansed of its impurities—if its imperfections could be made more perfect—its nature would also be perfected and it would become gold.": "如果铅可以被净化，如果它的瑕疵可以变得更完美，它的本质也将得到完善，它将变成黄金。",
	"Alchemy must be understood on those terms. It's not a search for wealth, it's a search for perfection. And it's not limited to metals. All things come in grades of perfection. Quartz is imperfect; a diamond nears perfection. A grape is imperfect; aged wine nears perfection. Knotty pine is imperfect; white oak nears perfection. What's true of minerals and plants can also be true of animals. A rat is imperfect; an Andalusian horse nears perfection. If it's true of lesser animals, it can also be true of people. If metal can be perfected, and the grape can be perfected, and the rat can be perfected, then why not a person? Perfection of the human spirit is the alchemist's true and ultimate goal. Learning to transmute (or purify) lead into gold is only the first step in that process. (And of course, the transformation must be permanent, not temporary as with the transmutation wizard's {@subclassFeature Minor Alchemy|Wizard|PHB|Transmutation|PHB|2|PHB} class feature.)": "炼金术必须根据这些条件来理解。这不是为了追求财富，而是为了追求完美。而且它不仅限于金属。所有事物都有不同程度的完美。石英是不完美的；钻石接近完美。葡萄是不完美的；陈年葡萄酒接近完美。多节松木是不完美的；白橡木接近完美。对矿物和植物成立的规律也适用于动物。老鼠是不完美的；安达卢西亚马接近完美。如果较低级别的动物适用，那么对人类也适用。如果金属可以被完善，葡萄可以被完善，老鼠可以被完善，那么为什么人类不可以呢？人类精神的完美是炼金术士真正和最终的目标。学会将铅转化为黄金（或净化）只是这一过程的第一步。（当然，转化必须是永久的，而不是像转化术士的{@subclassFeature Minor Alchemy|Wizard|PHB|Transmutation|PHB|2|PHB}职业特性那样是暂时的。）",
	"The alchemist's furnace aids that process. Heat and pressure perfect coal into diamonds, cold perfects water into ice, flame perfects wood into charcoal, sunlight and water perfect the acorn into the oak. The alchemist's furnace can replicate all these conditions and more for the alchemist who knows how to manipulate its controls.": "炼金术士的熔炉辅助这一过程。热量和压力将煤炭完美地转化为钻石，冷却将水完美地转化为冰，火焰将木材完美地转化为木炭，阳光和水将橡子完美地转化为橡树。炼金术士的熔炉可以为了懂得如何操控其控制装置的炼金术士复制所有这些条件以及更多。",
	"To use the alchemist's furnace, an item is placed inside along with appropriate catalysts, reagents, and purifying agents. The furnace is then sealed and the controls are adjusted to the desired settings. Once the activation lever is thrown, the furnace locks into its process and can't be stopped or altered until it's run its course. After {@dice 1d10} days, it unlocks and its contents can be removed.": "为了使用炼金术士的熔炉，在其中放入物品以及适当的催化剂、试剂和净化剂。然后密封熔炉，调整控制器至所需设置。一旦拉动激活杆，熔炉就会锁定并开始运行，直到完成过程后无法停止或更改。{@dice 1d10}天后，熔炉解锁，其中的物品可以取出。",
	"The controls on the furnace are tremendously varied and complex, with possible settings running into the hundreds of millions.": "炉子上的控制非常多样化和复杂，可能的设置数量高达数亿。",
	"For the desired transmutation to occur successfully, the alchemist overseeing the project must make a successful Intelligence check. The DC for the check depends on the desired effect. Sample DCs are listed on the Transformations table. If characters decide to experiment, the GM will probably need to make several judgment calls. The overseeing character's proficiency bonus can be added if the character is trained in the use of alchemy tools, and the number of previous attempts at this same transmutation can be added as a bonus on the roll.": "为了成功进行所需的转化，监督项目的炼金术士必须进行一次成功的智力检定。检定的难度取决于所需效果。样本难度等级列在变形表中。如果角色决定进行实验，GM可能需要做出几次判断。如果监督角色在使用炼金工具方面受过训练，他的熟练加值可以添加到检定中，而之前尝试过这种相同转化的次数可以作为奖励加到检定中。",
	"Additional bonuses on the Intelligence check can be gained by adding appropriate reagents and catalysts. Conversely, inappropriate reagents can impose penalties on the check. The appropriateness of any particular additive is up to the GM.": "通过添加适当的试剂和催化剂，可以获得智力检定的额外奖励。相反，不恰当的试剂可能会对检定造成惩罚。任何特定添加剂的适用性由（GM）决定。",
	"The result of a failed check usually is nothing more severe than wasted components and a mess that needs to be cleaned up. If the overseer's Intelligence check result is a natural 1, something went seriously wrong. The furnace might release toxic gas when it opens, it might create an angry quasit or manes instead of the desired item, or it might explode and blow everyone into atoms.": "失败的检定通常只会导致浪费材料和需要清理的混乱。如果监督者的智力检定结果是自然1，那么情况就严重了。当熔炉打开时可能会释放有毒气体，也可能会制造一个愤怒的小恶魔或曼斯，而不是期望的物品，或者可能会爆炸，把所有人炸成原子。",
	"The severity of the mishap should increase directly with the DC of the transformation being attempted.": "事故的严重程度应该与尝试的转化DC直接相关。",
	"It's also possible for a mishap to produce a serendipitous result. If the Intelligence check result is one lower than the DC or is a natural 20 but still a failure, the furnace produces something different from the desired item but still useful or interesting. This might be a powerful potion, a valuable substance, or a rare catalyst that can be included in the next attempt to gain a bonus on the check.": "即使出现意外，也有可能产生意外的结果。如果情报检定结果比DC低一点，或者是自然20但仍然失败，那么熔炉会产生与期望物品不同但仍然有用或有趣的东西。这可能是一瓶强力药水、一种有价值的物质，或者一种稀有催化剂，可以在下一次尝试中加入以获得检定奖励。",

	"The fish-cylinder is hollow, as anyone who taps on it quickly discovers. It has no apparent means of opening such as a screwed-in plug or a clamped‑down hatch. A few minutes of close examination and a successful {@dc 13} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check reveals a narrow, mud-clogged slot along the fish's belly. This slot is just wide enough for a knife edge to grip, and that's what's required; if a knife is dragged along the slot as if cutting the fish open, the cylinder splits apart into left and right halves that are joined by a concealed dorsal hinge.": "这个鱼形圆柱体是空心的，任何快速敲击它的人都会发现。它没有明显的打开方式，比如螺纹塞或夹紧的舱口。仔细观察几分钟并成功通过一次{@dc 13}智力检定({@skill Investigation})，会发现鱼腹部有一个狭窄、被泥巴堵塞的槽。这个槽只够宽以供刀刃握住，而这正是所需的；如果像切开鱼一样沿着槽拖动刀刃，圆柱体就会分裂成左右两半，它们由一个隐藏的背脊铰链连接在一起。",

	"Ooze plasma is the distilled essence of a {@creature gelatinous cube}, {@creature black pudding}, or other ooze creature. Visually, it resembles both a thick liquid and a gas. It's heavier than air so it can be held in open-topped bowls or tanks, and an object dipped gently into it comes out coated in ooze plasma. If a hand, wand, or other object is waved slowly through ooze plasma, the substance reacts and feels much like a thick liquid. It can be piped through tubes and drained through a spigot into a lower container, or even siphoned like water. If an object is waved quickly through ooze plasma, however, or if it's pressurized and squeezed through a nozzle, it behaves like a gas; the plasma flows around objects with no resistance, it floats upward and outward as if it's weightless before slowly settling back toward the ground. If sufficiently agitated, ooze plasma can even appear to dissipate or evaporate into the air, but this is an optical illusion; the plasma has only become so thin that it can't be seen. Eventually it settles downward and resembles a liquid again.": "软泥浆是{@creature gelatinous cube}、{@creature black pudding}或其他软泥怪物的精华。在视觉上，它既像浓稠的液体又像气体。它比空气重，因此可以放在敞口的碗或罐中，轻轻地将物体浸入其中，物体就会被软泥浆包裹。如果用手、魔杖或其他物体缓慢地在软泥浆中挥动，物质会产生反应，感觉就像浓稠的液体。它可以通过管道输送，并通过龙头排入下面的容器，甚至可以像水一样虹吸。然而，如果快速地挥动物体穿过软泥浆，或者通过喷嘴加压并挤压，它就会表现得像气体；软泥浆会在物体周围无阻力地流动，它会像无重力一样向上漂浮和向外流动，然后慢慢地回落到地面。如果软泥浆受到足够的搅动，甚至会看起来消散或蒸发到空气中，但这只是一种视觉幻觉；软泥浆只是变得如此稀薄，以至于看不见。最终，它会沉向下方，再次变成液体的样子。",
	"Ooze plasma is acidic. A creature that starts its turn in ooze plasma takes acid damage; the amount depends on how deeply the creature is submerged.

	"Upon drinking this potion, a creature is filled with feelings of inferiority and worthlessness. It has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and its speed is halved. Beneficially, however, other creatures pay no attention to it. They're aware of it—they see and hear the submissive creature normally—but they consider it to be no threat whatsoever and not worth paying attention to. Enemies that would normally attack the creature on sight don't lift a finger against it or even raise an eyebrow over its presence, in much the same way that powerful figures ignore lowly servants and attendants. The effect lasts 10 minutes or until the submissive creature makes an attack, is noticed taking something that doesn't belong to it, speaks to someone, or otherwise causes harm or steps out of line. Using a potion of submission guarantees that a creature can gain a surprise round in combat, but its first attack will be made with disadvantage (which may be canceled out if circumstances also grant it advantage).": "饮用此药水后，生物会充满自卑和无价值感。它在攻击检定和能力检定上有劣势，并且速度减半。然而，其他生物并不会关注它。他们意识到它——他们正常地看到和听到顺从的生物——但他们认为它根本不构成威胁，不值得关注。通常会对该生物发动攻击的敌人不会对其抬手攻击，甚至对其出现也不会抬眉，就像有权势的人忽视卑微的仆人和侍从一样。效果持续10分钟，或者直到顺从的生物发动攻击、被注意到拿走不属于它的东西、与某人交谈，或者以其他方式造成伤害或越线。使用顺从药水可以确保生物在战斗中获得意外回合，但它的第一次攻击将带有劣势（如果情况也给予它优势，则可能抵消）。",
	"The amethyst brooch is significant on deeper levels of the citadel, where it indicates its wearer is a person of importance to {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} and shouldn't be murdered without good reason. It is not, however, a guarantee of safe passage under all circumstances. Creatures on the lower levels understand symbols can be stolen and used by their enemies, and allowing the wrong person through just because they had a brooch is worse than not allowing the right person through because they didn't. For example, trollkin in the dwarven barracks (Level 3) won't defer to a character just because they have the brooch. It must be brandished as a sign of authority, and the wearer must behave as if they understand its significance. Otherwise, the trollkin assume the characters are murderers and thieves who should be dealt with as harshly as possible. The most likely way for characters to figure this out is by seeing leaders on lower levels wearing similar brooches.": "紫水晶胸针在城堡更深层次上具有重要意义，它表明佩戴者对{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}来说是一个重要人物，不应该没有充分理由就被谋杀。然而，在所有情况下，它并不是安全通行的保证。更低层次的生物明白符号可以被敌人窃取并利用，因此仅仅因为某人有了胸针就放行错误的人比因为没有胸针而不放行正确的人更糟糕。例如，在矮人兵营（第3层）的巨魔族不会仅仅因为某人有了胸针就对其恭顺。必须挥舞胸针作为权威的标志，并且佩戴者必须表现出他们理解其重要性。否则，巨魔族会认为这些角色是谋杀犯和小偷，应该尽可能严厉地对待。角色最有可能弄清楚这一点的方法是看到更低层次的领导者也佩戴类似的胸针。",

It doesn't follow a program; it responds to requests and built-in prerogatives in the best manner it can, according to its knowledge and understanding. In this case, it's simply not capable of fulfilling the purpose for which it was built (overcoming the elves' magic and shifting the entire arcane scriptorium to the present time), but it keeps trying. The way it tries is by following different temporal pathways from the present to 100,000 years in the future and back to the present again.

	"The construct has a limited supply of energy. Every so often, it must stop to recharge its energy matrices by siphoning vitality from the time continuum itself. Typically, this occurs after every {@dice 1d4} shifts to a different era. Each time the construct triggers its defensive field counts as one shift. It usually pauses to recharge while it has enough energy remaining for one shift, because shifting into an unknown time period with no reserve energy is a huge risk. Recharging takes {@dice 1d3} days.": "这个构造体有限的能量供应。每隔一段时间，它必须停下来通过从时间连续体中汲取活力来重新充能它的能量矩阵。通常，这发生在每隔 {@dice 1d4} 次转移到不同时代之后。每次构造体触发其防御场都算作一次转移。它通常会在剩余能量足够支持一次转移时暂停充能，因为在没有储备能量的情况下转移到未知的时间段是一个巨大的风险。充能需要 {@dice 1d3} 天。",

He now deserves to be called gruesome, but the irony is that no one aside from {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC|Imortra} has ever seen him this way.": "当地人戏称他为“可怕者”。因为没有人见过他，于是便传出了各种故事，说他长得面目可怖。有人说他的伤疤是由于一次魔法实验失败，也有人说他在出生后的几分钟内被父亲扔进黑河中。事实上，盖勒特年轻时可能是个英俊的人。数十年来在附近地脉强烈的魔法波动下生活在地下，导致他皮肤苍白无力，眼睛呆滞，皮肤上的病变永远不愈。现在他确实配得上“可怕者”的称号，但讽刺的是，除了{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC|Imortra}，没有人见过他这样。",

	"{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC} is an elf wizard who's fanatically devoted to {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}. She heard tales about the unique magical properties of the Scarlet Citadel region from elves who saw those properties firsthand centuries ago, before the Holzanger family laid any claim over the area. Those tales drew Imortra to the citadel to study, and {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC|Gellert} was already there.

	"Imortra's name originated during the years of her early adulthood, when her research and experiments in conjuring elementals and devils resulted in repeated tragedies.

When her conjurations resulted in innocent deaths, Imortra was banned from the elven community for two centuries.": "伊莫特拉(Imortra)的名字起源于她年轻时期的研究和实验，当时她召唤元素和恶魔的尝试导致了一系列悲剧。她所属的精灵社区传统认为这些行为属于“黑暗艺术”，谴责她触及了她无法理解和控制的邪恶力量。当她的召唤导致无辜者死亡时，伊莫特拉被精灵社区放逐了两个世纪。",

Like most dust goblins who rise to positions of leadership in their tribe, Keluikinj's mind is twisted and grim. He's no more sadistic than most dust goblins, but he has a fascination with the Void—or at least with the idea of the Void, as his understanding of the Void's nature is only a caricature of reality. Based on what he's seen inside the citadel, Keluikinj believes {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} and {@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC} have a connection to the Void that he'd like to exploit. They don't, but that belief is what's stopped the dust goblins so far from finishing what they came here for, which is murder and looting.

	"{@i The Scarlet Citadel} is a relatively straightforward adventure for players and the GM, but levels of the complex are connected both by key story elements and stairs. You'll also need to understand the relationships between inhabitants to get the most from this material.": "{@i The Scarlet Citadel} 是一个相对简单的冒险，适合玩家和主持人，但是复杂的层级之间通过关键故事元素和楼梯连接在一起。您还需要了解居民之间的关系，才能充分利用这些材料。",
	"The unifying villain of the Scarlet Citadel is {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, last (or nearly last) scion of the noble family of Holzanger, who built the citadel and once ruled the surrounding territory. Gellert dwells deep in the catacombs, where he can conduct his research on Void magic and the manipulation of ley energy in perfect seclusion. He's not, however, entirely cut off from the world. Powerful figures on other levels of the dungeon serve as his lieutenants in the underworld and as his liaisons to the surface world. Everything living beneath the Scarlet Citadel fears Gellert's power to one extent or another, though few have ever met the legendary sorcerer face-to-face.": "血色城堡的统一反派是{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}，霍尔赞格贵族家族的最后一位（或几乎是最后一位）后裔，他建造了城堡，曾统治周围的领土。盖勒特深居地下墓穴，可以在完美的隐居中进行有关虚空魔法和操纵地脉能量的研究。然而，他并非完全与世隔绝。地下城的其他层级上有强大的人物担任他的地底世界中的副手，并作为他与地表世界的联络人。血色城堡下的所有生物都害怕盖勒特的力量，尽管很少有人真正见过这位传奇巫师的真面目。",
	"Much of the original aboveground structure still stands, although it's not usable as a fortress in its present condition. Over the decades it has been used as a hideout by bandits and as a base of operations for adventurers exploring the area. Currently, it's been taken over by harpies that live in the basement of the main keep. They drive away most would-be heroes and sometimes terrorize nearby farms and logging camps. The harpies also throw their scraps to the owlbears that prowl the territory. The occasional presence of those predators contributes to keeping the crumbling fort free of curious interlopers.": "原始的地面以上结构仍然屹立不倒，尽管在目前的状态下无法用作堡垒。几十年来，它一直被强盗用作藏身之处，并成为探索该地区的冒险家的行动基地。目前，它已经被占领，由生活在主要城堡地下室的鹰身女妖(`harpies`)接管。它们驱赶了大多数想要成为英雄的人，有时还恐吓附近的农场和伐木营地。鹰身女妖还把剩饭扔给在领地里徘徊的猫头鹰熊(`owlbears`)。这些捕食者偶尔出现有助于使这座摇摇欲坠的堡垒远离好奇的闯入者。",
	"The entrances characters are most likely to find lead to underground passages and chambers that served as the castle dungeon when the Scarlet Citadel was still occupied by the Holzanger family and by the bandits who used it afterward. Unsurprisingly, in a world where rocs and dragons are real security concerns, the underground portion of the fortress was more extensive than the aboveground works. The current chief occupants of this level are a psychotic, sadistic torturer and serial killer known locally as {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}, along with a handful of equally twisted creatures that serve him. {@creature The Gaoler|KPSC} has no connection with {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, who tolerates his presence as a deterrent to explorers.": "在斯卡雷特城堡（Scarlet Citadel）仍由霍尔赞格家族（Holzanger family）和之后使用它的强盗占领时，角色最有可能发现的入口通往地下通道和室内，这些地方曾作为城堡地牢。在一个存在巨鹏和龙等真实安全威胁的世界里，堡垒的地下部分比地上建筑更加广阔。这一层的现任主要居住者是当地人称为{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}的精神病患者、虐待狂和连环杀手，以及一些同样扭曲的生物，它们为他效劳。{@creature The Gaoler|KPSC}与{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}没有关联，后者容忍他的存在是为了吓阻探险者。",
	"Beyond {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}'s chambers are ancient crypts of the Holzanger family. This section is rife with undead, thanks to a weak spot in the dimensional barrier between Midgard and the Dry Lands. That realm's corruption seeped into the crypts for centuries and worked its foul magic on the remains interred here. Even {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} avoids the crypts and guards against incursions from wandering undead.": "在{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}的房间之外是Holzanger家族的古老地下墓穴。这一区域充斥着不死生物，这要归功于中加德和干旱之地之间维度屏障的薄弱点。那个领域的腐化已经渗透到这些地下墓穴中数个世纪，并对这里安葬的遗骸施加了邪恶的魔法。即使{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}也避开这些地下墓穴，并防范来自游荡不死生物的侵袭。",
	"This level of the dungeon houses the arcane scriptorium and the mystical alchemy furnace. {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}, {@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC}, and their servants reside here, as do a group of covert dust goblins.": "这层地牢里有奥术书房和神秘炼金熔炉。{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}，{@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC}和他们的仆人居住在这里，还有一群秘密的尘土哥布林。",
	"{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} is a gnome wizard who hopes to unlock the secrets hidden in the forgotten scriptorium. The monographs buried here date back to the earliest years of the Holzanger residency and even to the time of the elves who predated them. In his quest to restore the heavily damaged manuscripts, {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} has become a master of time-manipulating magic. He is also a loyal vassal and apprentice of {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, since {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}'s arcane interests overlap Gellert's areas of study. When Gellert needs to be represented on the surface, {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} is the person he's most likely to send as his agent.": "{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}是一名侏儒巫师，希望解开被遗忘的书房中隐藏的秘密。这里埋藏的专著可以追溯到Holzanger驻地最早的年代，甚至可以追溯到比他们更早的精灵时代。在修复严重损坏的手稿的过程中，{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}已经成为了一名擅长操控时间的魔法大师。他也是{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}的忠诚臣民和学徒，因为{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}的奥术兴趣与Gellert的研究领域重叠。当Gellert需要在地表上代表时，{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}是他最可能派遣作为代理人的人选。",
	"The alchemist {@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC} is a human from the Magdar Kingdoms. Maksilov specializes in the study of slimes and oozes. She's managed to assemble an impressive laboratory for her studies, which also involve propagating novel species of her favorite creatures with unique properties.": "炼金术士{@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC}是来自马格达王国的人类。马克西洛夫专门研究史莱姆和软泥怪。她成功地建立了一个令人印象深刻的实验室用于她的研究，这些研究还涉及培育具有独特特性的新物种。",
	"Finally, a scavenging band of dust goblins has crept into this level, unbeknown to {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} and Maksilov. They're discreetly exploring, mapping the level's layout, and spying on its inhabitants with admirable caution while they size up the prospects for plunder.": "最终，一群尘土哥布林的搜寻队悄无声息地潜入了这个层面，{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}和Maksilov毫不知情。他们小心翼翼地探索，绘制着层面的布局图，并且以令人钦佩的谨慎观察着居民，同时评估着掠夺的前景。",
	"This level was carved out by a band of dwarven mercenaries from Melana who joined forces with Gerhardt III 150 years ago. All one hundred dwarves of the warband (which included not only soldiers of fortune but also owlbear trainers and a few skilled ring mages) resided in these spacious barracks styled after the great subterranean halls of their homeland.": "这个层级是由150年前与格哈特三世联手的来自梅拉纳的一支矮人雇佣兵团队开凿而成的。这支战队的一百名矮人（不仅包括了军事雇佣兵，还有猫头鹰熊训练师和一些熟练的戒指法师）都住在这些宽敞的兵营里，这些兵营的风格仿照了他们祖国的巨大地下大厅。",
	"When the aboveground portion of the Scarlet Citadel was overthrown and sacked by the knights of Khors 110 years ago, the dwarves stayed on, secure in their underground fortress with their ring magic and specially bred dire owlbears—or so they believed. But trollkin knew about the barracks. A few had even been hired as heavy laborers during construction, and that proved a fatal mistake for the dwarves. After a protracted siege to weaken the dwarves, the trollkin assaulted the fortifications with fierce determination. Gate by gate, room by room, barricade by barricade, the trollkin battered, smashed, mined, and burned their way through the stronghold until every dwarf was slain and the magnificent halls were theirs.": "110年前，卡斯(`Khors`)骑士攻占并洗劫了绯红城堡(`Scarlet Citadel`)的地面部分，但矮人们留了下来，安全地待在他们的地下堡垒里，依靠他们的戒指魔法和特别培育的恐怖猫头鹰熊(`dire owlbears`)——他们认为如此就足够安全了。但巨魔子民知道兵营的情况。一些巨魔子民甚至在建筑过程中被雇为重体力劳动者，这对矮人来说是致命的错误。在经过漫长的围攻削弱矮人之后，巨魔子民以顽强的决心攻击了要塞。一扇扇大门，一个个房间，一道道栅栏，巨魔子民破坏、摧毁、挖掘和焚烧他们的方式穿过了这座堡垒，直到每个矮人都被杀死，壮丽的大厅成了他们的。",
	"A handful of trollkin still live here. They pledge no fealty to {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, but they fear him and his lieutenants {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} and {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}, who control the levels above and below this one, respectively.": "这里仍有一小群巨魔子族居住。他们对{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}不效忠，但他们害怕他及其手下{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}和{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}，分别控制着这一层楼上下的层级。",
	"Because of the dungeon's layout, characters are unlikely to find an entrance to the lower three levels that doesn't involve coming through this level. That means they must either kill all the trollkin or strike some sort of deal with them for safe passage. The first option won't be easy, but it might be more attainable than the second. If the trollkin aren't destroyed or bribed generously, they'll be a deadly threat to the explorers' only line of retreat.": "由于地牢的布局，角色们很难找到一个不经过这一层就能进入下面三层的入口。这意味着他们必须要么杀死所有的巨魔族，要么与他们达成某种协议以获得安全通行。第一种选择不会容易，但可能比第二种更可行。如果巨魔族没有被消灭或大笔贿赂，他们将对探险者唯一的撤退线构成致命威胁。",
	"Three distinct groups coexist on this level.": "这一层有三个不同的群体共存。",
	"First is a cult of humanoids who worship Camazotz, the demon lord of bats, and a colony of giant bats that shares the cult's large cavern. Other than their fearsome high priest, cult members tend to be maimed and degenerated examples of humanoid stock. The bats, however, are healthy and savage. These creatures have nothing to do with Gellert, and he takes little interest in them.": "首先是一群崇拜蝙蝠魔王卡马佐特(Camazotz)的人形生物邪教徒，以及与邪教共享大洞穴的一群巨型蝙蝠。除了他们可怕的高级祭司外，邪教成员往往是人形生物中残缺和堕落的典型。然而，这些蝙蝠健康而凶猛。这些生物与盖勒特(Gellert)无关，他对它们几乎不感兴趣。",
	"{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC} is the second of Gellert's disciples, ranking above {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} in power and influence with their master. She is an elfmarked diabolist who shares Gellert's interest in the Void and sometimes helps directly in his research. Imortra commands several devils of significant power and can call more when needed.": "{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}是盖勒特的第二位门徒，在力量和影响力上超过{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}，与他们的导师关系密切。她是一位半精灵标记的恶魔术士，与盖勒特一样对虚空感兴趣，有时直接协助他的研究。伊莫特拉指挥着几只实力强大的恶魔，并在需要时可以召唤更多。",
	"The last group is a small band of derro outcasts who pledged themselves to Imortra out of deference to her diabolical power. They provide her some amount of security (supplementing her indentured devils) and bring her humanoid captives gathered from far and wide to serve as menial laborers and test subjects.": "最后一组是一小群德罗流亡者，他们向伊莫特拉宣誓效忠，出于对她邪恶力量的尊敬。他们为她提供一定程度的安全（补充她的契约恶魔），并带来从四面八方搜集来的人类俘虏，作为苦力和实验对象。",
	"Important features of the caverns shared by Imortra and the derro exist outside the normal reality of Midgard. They are accessible only by imbibing fungal potions distilled by the derro.": "伊莫特拉 (Imortra) 和德罗 (derro) 共享的洞穴具有重要特征，存在于中加德 (Midgard) 正常现实之外。只有通过饮用德罗蒸馏的真菌药剂才能进入这些洞穴。",
	"The earliest members of the Holzanger family who built the Scarlet Citadel, and possibly the elves before them, understood the site was the confluence of three ley lines. What they didn't know was the fortress also sat atop a stretch of the Black River (the term applied by cultists of Charun to shadow roads). Ironically, this section of shadow road coincides with a subterranean river, making the cult's metaphoric label literally true in this locale. In the manner of most theologically driven zealots, the cultists fixated on that accident of nature and invested it with an importance far beyond its simple symbolic coincidence. They carved a temple to their dark god into the caverns surrounding the river and set about their grim worship.": "Holzanger家族最早的成员建造了猩红城堡，可能是在他们之前的精灵，他们了解到这个地点是三条地脉的交汇处。他们不知道的是，这座堡垒也坐落在黑河的一段上面（Charun邪教徒对暗影之路的称呼）。具有讽刺意味的是，这段暗影之路与地下河重合，使得邪教徒对这个地方的隐喻标签在字面上成为了事实。像大多数受神学驱使的狂热者一样，邪教徒们专注于自然的这种偶然性，并赋予它远远超出简单象征巧合的重要性。他们在围绕着这条河流的洞穴中雕刻了一个供奉他们黑暗神灵的神庙，并开始了他们阴森的崇拜。",
	"Eventually, the cultists discovered the Howling Halls beneath their temple, and the head of the cult was drawn to investigate Void magic. He entered into an alliance of convenience with Void cultists, and soon they were as numerous in the temple as followers of Charun. Conflicts followed inevitably, until eventually the Void cultists declared the temple theirs and made it clear Charun's adherents were not welcome and wouldn't be tolerated.": "最终，异教徒们发现了他们庙宇下面的嚎叫大厅，该异教团的首领被吸引去调查虚空魔法。他与虚空异教徒结成了便利联盟，很快他们在庙宇中就像卡伦的追随者一样众多。冲突随之不可避免地发生，直到最终虚空异教徒宣布庙宇为他们所有，并明确表示卡伦的信徒不受欢迎，也不会被容忍。",
	"Even the Void cultists couldn't hold the temple forever. Other creatures coveted what the cultists had and challenged them for possession of the site. The Void cult defended its shrine for decades, but the enemy was persistent and patient.

	"Despite such fearsome neighbors, one resident is the undisputed master of this level: {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}.

	"At the lowest level of the dungeon is an enigma: a massive {@item sphere of annihilation}, somehow bound in place by an unknown entity in a forgotten age. It pulls terrific wind through the twisting, elementally-charged tunnels of the labyrinth. The sphere's connection to the Void makes it of great interest to {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}. Ideally, he'd like to find a way to take control of it, but that goal has eluded him for four decades. Meanwhile, the Howling Halls surrounding the sphere are flooded with elemental energy, making them by far the most dangerous places in the entire dungeon complex.": "在地牢的最底层有一个谜团：一个巨大的{@item sphere of annihilation}，以某种方式被一个在遗忘时代的未知实体束缚在那里。它通过迷宫中扭曲、元素充斥的隧道中吹来可怕的风。这个球体与虚空的联系使其对{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}非常感兴趣。理想情况下，他想找到一种控制它的方法，但这个目标已经让他苦苦追寻了四十年。与此同时，环绕着这个球体的咆哮大厅充斥着元素能量，使它们成为整个地牢复合体中最危险的地方。",
	"The site of the Scarlet Citadel is extremely potent with ley-line energy. The titanic White Road runs fewer than 60 miles to the south, and lesser ley lines crisscross the region. Most importantly, a ley line tributary wanders across almost the entire site and forms a sizable eddy beneath the fortress. Even better, this ley line forms a connection between the White Road, the Pontoretto ley line of Valera, a smaller line called the Wandering Crow, and even a shadow road to the northwest—or at least it does now, thanks to blood-soaked rituals enacted centuries ago by Gellert's ancestor Gerhardt the Elder.": "血色城堡遗址处的地势异常陡峭，充满了地脉能量。巨大的白色之路向南不到60英里，而次要的地脉在该地区交错纵横。最重要的是，一个地脉支流几乎横穿整个遗址，并在堡垒下形成一个相当大的涡流。更好的是，这条地脉连接了白色之路、瓦莱拉的庞托雷托地脉、一个名为流浪乌鸦的较小地脉，甚至是西北方的暗影之路——至少现在是这样，多亏了格勒特的祖先格哈特老者几个世纪前进行的染血仪式。",
	"This confluence and pooling of energy is all but unique in Midgard, and it's the most closely guarded secret about the site. The only way for low-level characters to uncover a bit of arcane history this esoteric would be to spend at least a month in research at one of the great libraries of Zobeck or Hirschberg—or a few hours in the Arcane Scriptorium beneath the citadel. It's why {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} and his minions value the family estate so highly in spite of its gross deterioration.

	"Characters relying on light sources can be seen by everyone, friend or foe, at any distance. No matter how quiet they are, they broadcast their approach if the halo from their light extends past the corner of a hallway or can be seen through an open doorway or under a closed door.

Some traps are meant to kill intruders, some to trap them, and some just to warn inhabitants that trouble is approaching.": "这些角色并不是第一批入侵堡垒的袭击者，因此其居民已经做好了应对这种情况的准备。血色城堡是他们的家园，而怪物和其他居民则熟知它的通道、瓶颈和死胡同，以及它的陷阱。一些陷阱旨在杀死入侵者，一些用于困住他们，还有一些只是为了警告居民有麻烦正在接近。",
	"Where traps are concerned, it's important for the GM and players to keep some things in mind.": "在考虑到陷阱时，GM和玩家需要记住一些重要事项。",
	"First, you don't want traps to become routine. Players easily fall into lazy habits such as scanning every room and hallway for traps before entering if they're allowed to. It would be a poor trap that could be spotted in a few seconds of scanning from 20 feet away. Give the trapmakers more credit than that. They work hard to conceal their handiwork.": "首先，你不希望陷阱变得司空见惯。如果玩家被允许的话，他们很容易养成懒惰的习惯，比如在进入每个房间和走廊之前都会仔细搜索陷阱。如果一个陷阱在20英尺外的几秒钟扫描中就能被发现，那将是一个很糟糕的陷阱。请给陷阱制造者更多的信任。他们努力工作来隐藏他们的手艺。",
	"Second, the {@skill Investigation} and {@skill Perception} skills are easily confused (and abused) where trap-finding is concerned. Players and GMs tend to over-rely on {@skill Perception}, which leads players to maximize their {@skill Perception} scores and ignore {@skill Investigation}. There's nothing wrong with a character specializing in something and becoming really, really good at it. The problem arises when a specialist is allowed to apply their narrow specialization in every situation, whether or not it fits.": "其次，{@skill Investigation}和{@skill Perception}技能在寻找陷阱时很容易被混淆（和滥用）。玩家和GM往往过分依赖{@skill Perception}，这导致玩家最大化他们的{@skill Perception}分数并忽视{@skill Investigation}。角色专精某项技能并在其中变得非常擅长是没有问题的。问题在于当一个专家被允许在每种情况下应用他们狭窄的专长，无论是否合适时就会出现。",
	"Here's how {@skill Investigation} and {@skill Perception} are treated in {@i The Scarlet Citadel}. Note this discussion relates  specifically to finding traps and secret doors. Both skills have uses beyond those described here.": "这里是在{@i The Scarlet Citadel}中如何处理{@skill Investigation}和{@skill Perception}的情况。请注意，这个讨论特别涉及到寻找陷阱和秘密门。这两项技能还有其他用途，不在此讨论范围内。",
	"{@skill Perception} represents a character's general awareness of surroundings and their ability to sense when something is amiss, along with their ability to spot things that are small and hard to see. A successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check tells a character something about the scene is wrong, but it doesn't necessarily reveal specifically what's wrong. Sometimes it does, but not always; it depends on the situation.": "{@skill Perception}代表角色对周围环境的一般认知以及察觉到异常情况的能力，还包括发现那些微小且难以察觉的事物的能力。成功的感知（智力{@skill Perception}）检定会告诉角色场景中有什么不对劲，但不一定会具体揭示是什么不对劲。有时候会，但并非总是；这取决于具体情况。",
	"{@skill Investigation} represents a character's ability to collate bits of information into a specific conclusion. Where {@skill Perception} often deals in hunches and instinct or in revealing the presence of something without clarifying its meaning or significance, {@skill Investigation} allows specific, sometimes seemingly unrelated details to be focused into a coherent picture.": "{@skill Investigation}代表角色将信息整合成特定结论的能力。而{@skill Perception}通常凭直觉和本能处理事情，或者揭示某种存在而不澄清其含义或重要性，{@skill Investigation}则允许将具体的、有时看似不相关的细节聚焦成一个连贯的画面。",
	"With those two definitions in mind, here's how characters can locate traps and secret doors in the citadel.": "牢记这两个定义，这里是角色如何在要塞中找到陷阱和秘密门的方法。",
	"{@b If a trap has visible features}, a successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check is enough to reveal it. A tripwire across a hallway is one example; once it's noticed, characters can just step over it. They don't know what the trap does. They could opt to trigger the trap from a distance by tossing a stick onto the wire, but that's risky without knowing what will happen. Another example would be holes in the wall with scorch marks around them; flames must shoot out of those holes. Characters don't know what triggers the trap, but they can avoid the flames by crawling under the holes or by plugging them up.": "{@b If a trap has visible features}, 一次成功的感知 ({@skill Perception}) 检定就足以揭示它。走廊上的绊线就是一个例子；一旦被注意到，角色们可以轻松跨过它。他们不知道陷阱的作用。他们可以选择远距离触发陷阱，比如扔一根棍子到绊线上，但在不知道会发生什么的情况下这是有风险的。另一个例子是墙上有烧焦痕迹的洞口；火焰必定会从这些洞口喷射出来。角色不知道是什么触发了陷阱，但他们可以通过爬过洞口下方或者堵住洞口来避开火焰。",
	"In these situations, characters can learn more about the trap by interacting with it carefully (while asking you questions). If they're still unsure what to do, they can attempt an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check at the original DC to get a clearer understanding. Encourage them to treat the situation like a puzzle instead of an exercise in dice-rolling.": "在这些情况下，角色可以通过仔细与陷阱互动（并向你提问）来了解更多信息。如果他们仍然不确定该怎么做，他们可以尝试进行一个智力检定（{@skill Investigation}）以原始难度等级来更清楚地理解。鼓励他们将情况视为一个谜题，而不是一个掷骰子的练习。",
	"This type of Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check can search one adjacent 5-foot-square area of floor or 5-foot wall section in a turn (6 seconds). Don't check separately for each area, just estimate how long the search takes and make one roll. Most rooms can be scanned this way in a minute or so.": "这种智慧检定({@skill Perception})可以在一个回合（6秒）内搜索一个相邻的5英尺正方形地板区域或5英尺的墙壁部分。不要为每个区域单独检查，只需估计搜索需要多长时间并进行一次检定。大多数房间可以在一分钟左右用这种方式扫描完毕。",
	"If a trap has no visible features—no tripwire, no spikes protruding from the ceiling, no scorch marks on the wall, no bloodstains on the floor—{@skill Perception} is much less useful. These situations are made for {@skill Investigation}.": "如果一个陷阱没有明显的特征——没有绊线，天花板上没有突出的尖刺，墙壁上没有烧焦的痕迹，地板上没有血迹——{@skill Perception} 就不太有用了。这种情况适合使用{@skill Investigation}。",
	"{@skill Investigation} requires an active search. Actively investigating a 5-foot-square area of floor or a 5-foot section of wall takes one character 1 minute. This may seem like a long time, but the characters' lives may depend on this search being thorough! It's not something to rush through.": "{@skill Investigation} 需要积极搜索。积极调查一个5英尺的正方形地板区域或一段5英尺长的墙壁需要一个角色1分钟。这可能看起来很长时间，但角色的生命可能取决于这次彻底的搜索！这不是一件应该草率对待的事情。",
	"{@skill Investigation} of a large area should be resolved with a single skill check, but it still takes 1 minute for every 5-by-5 floor square and 1 minute for every 5 feet of wall length. Thoroughly investigating a 25-foot-square room, for example, takes about 40 minutes (25 minutes for the floor plus 20 minutes for the walls minus a few minutes to account for obvious doorways).": "一个大区域的{@skill Investigation}应该通过一次技能检定来解决，但每5英尺×5英尺的地板方块需要1分钟，每5英尺的墙长也需要1分钟。例如，对一个25英尺×25英尺的房间进行彻底调查大约需要40分钟（地板25分钟加上墙壁20分钟减去一些时间来考虑明显的门口）。",
	"The time can be shortened by having multiple characters search different areas. In that case, each searcher makes an independent Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check for their own area.": "时间可以通过让多个角色搜索不同的区域来缩短。在这种情况下，每个搜索者为自己的区域进行独立的智力检定（{@skill Investigation}）。",
	"{@skill Investigation} reveals more than {@skill Perception} does. A successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check of a trap reveals the trigger and any understandable details about its effect. For example, the investigator might learn that stepping on {@i this} flagstone causes {@i that} wall panel to open, but it's impossible to know what's behind the wall panel without opening it. Successful investigation of a secret door reveals the door's location and how to open it.": "{@skill Investigation}比{@skill Perception}透露更多信息。一个成功的智力检查({@skill Investigation})可以揭示陷阱的触发器以及关于其效果的任何可理解的细节。例如，调查员可能会发现踩在{@i this}石板上会导致{@i that}墙板打开，但是不可能在不打开墙板的情况下知道墙板后面是什么。成功调查秘密门会揭示门的位置以及如何打开它。",
	"{@skill Perception} isn't useless in these situations, but all a successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check produces is a suspicion about the area, a knowing that something in it is {@i wrong}. There could be traps, or concealed doors, or something else entirely. To get more information, characters must explore more fully.": "在这些情况下，{@skill Perception}并不无用，但一个成功的智慧检定({@skill Perception})只会让人对这个区域产生怀疑，知道其中某些事物是{@i wrong}。可能会有陷阱，或隐藏的门，或者完全不同的东西。要获得更多信息，角色必须更全面地探索。",
	"{@b Magical traps} should be treated the same as traps with no visible features, but they're found with the {@skill Arcana} skill instead of {@skill Investigation}. If there are visible warning signs—a glyph carved into a stone step, for example— {@skill Perception} works as normal.": "{@b Magical traps}应该被视为没有明显特征的陷阱，但是它们是通过{@skill Arcana}技能而不是{@skill Investigation}来发现的。如果有可见的警告标志——比如刻在石阶上的符文——{@skill Perception}就像平常一样起作用。",
	"The only time a repeat check should be allowed is if the situation changes significantly. For example, an NPC telling them (not showing; that's automatic) where the door is or gaining an experience level are good reasons to allow a new try.": "唯一允许重新检查的情况是如果情况发生了显著变化。例如，NPC告诉他们（不是展示；那是自动的）门在哪里，或者获得一个经验等级都是允许重新尝试的好理由。",
	"{@b If areas being searched are more than 5 feet away}, the search can take longer or you can impose penalties on the check. Also remember that {@quickref Vision and Light||2||dim light} imposes disadvantage on visual Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks; this can be significant for characters who rely on {@sense darkvision} when scouting ahead of the main group.": "{@b If areas being searched are more than 5 feet away}, 搜索可能需要更长时间，或者你可以对检查施加惩罚。还要记住，{@quickref Vision and Light||2||dim light} 对视觉感知（{@skill Perception}）检查施加劣势；对于依赖{@sense darkvision}在主要小组前面侦察的角色来说，这可能很重要。",
	"Just seeing the {@dice d20} roll on a skill check is often enough to give players a good idea whether their attempt succeeded or failed, regardless of what you tell them about it and what their characters see afterward. Likewise, simply asking for a die roll when it seems unnecessary can tip players off that an area is more dangerous than it appears or it needs to be checked more thoroughly for secrets.": "仅仅看到{@dice d20}在技能检定中的点数，通常就足以让玩家大致知道他们的尝试是成功还是失败，无论你告诉他们什么，以及他们的角色之后看到了什么。同样地，当似乎没必要时简单地要求掷骰子，可能会让玩家意识到某个区域比表面看起来更危险，或者需要更仔细地检查是否有秘密。",
	"You can avoid these unwanted tip-offs by using the characters' passive scores. Passive {@skill Perception} is the most important of these, but others can be useful too.": "您可以通过使用角色的被动分数来避免这些不必要的提示。被动{@skill Perception}是其中最重要的，但其他分数也可能会有用。",
	"When characters approach a trap or pass a secret door, instead of asking for a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check and comparing it to the feature's DC, make a {@dice d20} roll for the feature and compare the result to the characters' passive {@skill Perception} scores. The modifier on your roll equals the feature's DC−8. For example, if text indicates noticing a trap requires a successful {@dc 14} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, then you roll a {@dice 1d20 + 6} and compare the result to the passive {@skill Perception} of characters who are in danger of triggering the trap (lower is better in this case). If characters are moving slowly and paying close attention to such things, roll {@dice 2d20} and use the lower of the two results (effectively giving the trap or secret door disadvantage to remain unnoticed). If the group is moving rapidly or not being careful in your estimation, roll {@dice 2d20} and use the higher of the two results.": "当角色接近陷阱或经过秘密门时，不要要求进行一个智力检定（{@skill Perception}）并将其与特征的DC进行比较，而是为该特征进行一个{@dice d20}检定，并将结果与角色的被动{@skill Perception}分数进行比较。你的检定修正值等于特征的DC-8。例如，如果文本指出注意到一个陷阱需要一个成功的{@dc 14}智力检定（{@skill Perception}），那么你进行一个{@dice 1d20 + 6}检定，并将结果与有可能触发陷阱的角色的被动{@skill Perception}分数进行比较（在这种情况下，较低的结果更好）。如果角色移动缓慢并且密切关注这些事物，进行{@dice 2d20}检定并使用两个结果中较低的一个（有效地使陷阱或秘密门难以被察觉）。如果团队移动迅速或在你的估计中不够小心，进行{@dice 2d20}检定并使用两个结果中较高的一个。",
	"A useful GM's technique when characters are searching for traps or secrets, trying to open a lock, or making any other skill check is to roll a {@dice d20} yourself when the players do. Players should know you're doing this, but they shouldn't see the result of the roll. Explain there are many cases in which a character has advantage or disadvantage on the check without knowing it. The {@dice d20} you roll could be helping their attempt or hurting it—or it could be you rolling a die just to keep them guessing.": "当角色搜索陷阱或秘密、尝试打开锁或进行任何其他技能检定时，一个有用的GM技巧是在玩家进行检定时自己掷出一个{@dice d20}。玩家应该知道你这样做了，但不应看到掷骰的结果。解释有许多情况下，角色在检定中具有优势或劣势，而他们并不知情。你掷出的{@dice d20}可能会帮助他们的尝试，也可能会阻碍，又或者只是为了让他们猜测而掷骰。",
	"The Scarlet Citadel is written with these assumptions about {@skill Investigation}, {@skill Perception}, and traps. As GM, you're not required to adopt any of these approaches in your game, but you should understand why certain encounters are written the way they are.": "《血色城堡》是根据对{@skill Investigation}、{@skill Perception}和陷阱的这些假设编写的。作为GM，您不必在游戏中采用这些方法，但您应该了解为什么某些遭遇被写成这样。",
	"Like traps, only one attempt should be allowed to pick a lock. Additional characters can aid in the attempt, but don't allow players to keep rolling until someone gets a high number.": "与陷阱类似，只允许尝试一次来撬锁。其他角色可以帮助尝试，但不要让玩家一直滚动骰子直到有人得到一个高数。",
	"If the attempt fails, characters have four options. They can search for the key, they can use magic such as a {@spell knock} spell or {@item chime of opening|DMG|chimes of opening}, they can smash the door open, or they can wait until they gain an experience level and try again. Unless text states otherwise, assume smashing a door open requires a successful Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check against the lock's DC + 3. Again, allow only one attempt (with aid) per experience level.": "如果尝试失败，角色有四个选择。他们可以寻找钥匙，可以使用魔法，比如{@spell knock}法术或{@item chime of opening|DMG|chimes of opening}，他们可以破门而入，或者他们可以等待直到获得一个经验等级再试一次。除非文本另有说明，假设破门需要通过一个成功的力量检定（{@skill Athletics}）来超过锁的DC + 3。再次强调，每个经验等级只允许一次尝试（可以有帮助）。",
	"If the roll to open the lock is a natural 1, the character's lockpick breaks. They'll need to get a new set of {@item thieves' tools|PHB} back in Redtower or elsewhere in the dungeon. At your option, you can allow characters without {@item thieves' tools|PHB} to try picking locks, but they do so with disadvantage and can't apply their proficiency bonus to the attempt.": "如果开锁的骰点结果是自然1，角色的撬锁工具会损坏。他们需要在Redtower或地牢其他地方重新获得一套{@item thieves' tools|PHB}。根据你的选择，你可以允许没有{@item thieves' tools|PHB}的角色尝试撬锁，但他们会带着劣势进行尝试，并且不能在尝试中应用他们的熟练加值。",
	"The early stages of the Scarlet Citadel are suitable for low-level characters (levels 1 and 2). From there, the challenge ramps up quickly as explorers press deeper into the dungeon. Characters probably won't gain enough experience in the Scarlet Citadel to advance at the same rate as the challenge. You should encourage players to return to the town of Redtower between dungeon levels and take on side quests there until they level up. Alternatively, if you're not interested in exploring the territory around the town and sending characters on secondary quests, you can ignore experience points and use milestones instead; in that case, characters gain a level each time they complete a major portion of the adventure.": "血色城堡的早期阶段适合低级角色（1级和2级）。从那里开始，随着探险者深入地牢，挑战迅速增加。角色可能不会在血色城堡中获得足够的经验来与挑战的速度保持一致。你应该鼓励玩家在地牢层级之间返回红塔镇，并在那里接受支线任务直到升级。或者，如果你对探索城镇周围的领土并派遣角色执行次要任务不感兴趣，你可以忽略经验点，改用里程碑；在这种情况下，角色每次完成冒险的一个重要部分时都会升级。",
	"A default DC is provided for those times when you need to make an on-the-fly decision about how difficult a task or saving throw should be. Challenges are generally geared toward a party of four characters. If your group is bigger than that, they may be able to deal with the Scarlet Citadel at levels 20 to 40 percent lower than what's listed here.": "在需要即时决定任务或豁免检定难度时，提供了一个默认 DC。挑战通常是针对四名角色的队伍设计的。如果你的团队人数超过四名，他们可能能够以比这里列出的等级低 20 到 40% 的水平应对 Scarlet Citadel (绯红城堡).",
	"The inhabitants of the Scarlet Citadel don't sit idly by as their sanctum is invaded and torn apart room by room. As soon as characters start fighting their way through Level 1, {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} becomes aware the complex is under attack and alerts {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}. Imortra doesn't care about {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} or any undead in the crypt, so her initial reaction is nothing more than telling {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} to deal with it. When he fails to do so (in other words, when the Arcane Scriptorium is sacked), Imortra starts taking the situation seriously.": "当血色城堡的居民看到他们的圣所被逐一入侵和摧毁时，并不坐视不管。一旦角色们开始在一层战斗，{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} 意识到复杂正在遭受攻击，并警告{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}。伊莫特拉并不关心{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}或者地下室里的任何不死生物，所以她最初的反应只是告诉{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}去处理。当他未能做到（换句话说，当奥术抄写室被洗劫时），伊莫特拉开始认真对待这种情况。",
	"From that point on, never allow the dungeons to be static places. If characters battle through the dwarven barracks on Level 3 and kill everything in sight, then when they retreat to rest, Imortra infiltrates some of her devils or duergar back into Level 3 to ambush the characters again when they return (as adventurers inevitably do).": "从那时起，永远不要让地牢保持静态。如果角色们在3级的矮人兵营中奋战并杀尽一切，那么当他们撤退休息时，伊莫特拉（Imortra）会派遣一些她的恶魔或杜尔加（duergar）重新潜入3级，在角色们再次返回时再次伏击他们（因为冒险者们不可避免地会回来）。",
	"At the end of each level is a section titled Restocking. It covers in greater detail exactly what the dungeon's occupants do to discourage characters from coming back after they've cleared a level. In extreme cases, these even suggest attacks against the characters outside the dungeon.": "在每个级别的末尾都有一个名为“补给”(Restocking)的部分。它更详细地介绍了地牢的居民为阻止角色在清理完一个级别后再次回来所做的事情。在极端情况下，甚至会建议对地牢外的角色发动攻击。",
	"The Scarlet Citadel is intensely dangerous. Most levels include foes and situations that are too powerful even for characters of the recommended experience level for that stage of the adventure. This is intentional. Characters are expected to retreat from overwhelming danger, regroup, and use what they learn to come up with a better plan before trying again.": "血色城堡是极其危险的。大多数层级包括对于建议经验等级的角色来说甚至过于强大的敌人和情境。这是有意为之的。角色们应该从压倒性的危险中撤退，重新集结，利用所学到的东西制定更好的计划，然后再次尝试。",
	"As the Game Master, you should point this out to players before the adventure starts. Ensure they understand that recognizing when a fight is too dangerous is essential, and retreating is expected. Many players are loath to retreat from anything for any reason and would rather try to mesmerize the dice than exercise good tactical sense. They won't survive.": "作为游戏主持人，在冒险开始之前，你应该向玩家指出这一点。确保他们明白，识别出战斗过于危险时是至关重要的，撤退是可以预料的。许多玩家不愿意因任何原因而撤退，宁愿试图迷惑骰子，而不是运用良好的战术意识。他们将无法生存。",
	"If retreat is not in your group's playbook, your responsibility as GM is to brief them outside of play— probably during character creation—that they need to \"get their minds right\" about retreating. Pulling back from a fight they can't win isn't cowardly, it's smart. They're guaranteed to face that situation more than once in the Scarlet Citadel.": "如果撤退不在你们小组的策略中，作为GM，你的责任是在游戏外向他们简要解释——可能是在角色创建过程中——他们需要“调整心态”来对待撤退。从一场他们无法赢得的战斗中撤退并不是懦弱，而是明智之举。在《血色城堡》中，他们肯定会面临这种情况不止一次。",
	"Characters setting out to explore the Scarlet Citadel hear rumors about it in the nearby town of Redtower. Exactly what and how they heard about it is up to you.": "一群角色决定探索绯红城堡，在附近的赤塔镇听说了一些关于它的传闻。关于它们听到了什么以及如何听说的，就由你来决定。",
	"Information on Redtower can be found in the following chapter. A few other possibilities are listed here.": "关于红塔（Redtower）的信息可以在以下章节中找到。这里列出了一些其他可能性。",
	"{@creature Ichbon Teastrainer|KPSC}, a halfling naturalist collecting samples from the countryside, disappeared about a week ago. The innkeeper who rented Teastrainer a room is concerned about what happened to his lodger. The halfling didn't seem the sort who'd skip out on a bill.": "{@creature Ichbon Teastrainer|KPSC}，一个从乡间采集样本的半身人博物学家，大约一周前失踪了。出租房间给Teastrainer的旅馆老板对他的房客发生了什么事感到担忧。这位半身人似乎不是那种会逃账的人。",
	"{@creature Dugan Lovay|KPSC} is a trader who was expected in Redtower a few days ago. Maybe she was just delayed, but it doesn't pay to take chances in these troubled times. A committee of local merchants wants to hire some capable travelers to follow the road Lovay should be on and learn what happened. She usually travels with a knight bodyguard called the Red Hart.": "{@creature Dugan Lovay|KPSC}是一位预计几天前就应该抵达红塔的商人。也许她只是延误了，但在这个动荡时期，冒险是不明智的。一群当地商人委托一些能干的旅行者沿着Lovay应该经过的道路前去调查发生了什么。她通常会有一名骑士护卫，名为红鹿。",
	"Some dungeons are dug out with precision by massive hordes of undead workers or tribes of goblins, built in great chaos and energy to the plan of some cunning mind. The Scarlet Citadel is more of a peculiar growth of layer upon layer of tunnels, defensive halls, hidden crypts and labs, and many secrets buried deep below the surface.": "一些地牢是由大量的不死工人或地精部落精确挖掘而成，以极大的混乱和能量建造，按照一些狡猾头脑的计划。血色城堡更像是一种奇特的地下隧道、防御大厅、隐藏的地穴和实验室层层叠加的生长，许多秘密深藏在地表以下。",
	"Human settlement of the White Forest started modestly indeed at the nearby river village of Redtower. However, over time, both the village and the castle deeper in the woods became a site of importance to dungeoneers, arcane seekers, geomancers, and a certain breed of dwarven mystic. Read on and know the truth of its founding, its blood-soaked history, and its current odd decay.": "白森林的人类定居确实是在附近的红塔沿河村庄开始的。然而，随着时间的推移，无论是村庄还是更深处的城堡都成为了地牢探险者、奥术探索者、地卜师和某种类型的矮人秘术师重要的场所。继续阅读，了解它建立的真相、其血腥历史以及当前奇怪的衰落。",
	"The castle now called the Scarlet Citadel sits on the site of an ancient elven hunting lodge in the White Forest, claimed by a noble family after the Great Retreat 400-some years ago. The land was thus owned by House Holzanger, who owed fealty at various times to Illyria, the Republic of Triolo, the Canton of Melana, and (most often) to the Magdar Kingdom. Always rather deft in politics and inclined to an unambitious policy of, \"Just leave us alone with our books and hawks and hunting,\" House Holzanger might have remained a footnote if it were not for their control of the Scarlet Crow ley line and their willingness to annoy the fey lords and ladies of the forest.": "现在被称为血色城堡的城堡坐落在白色森林中一座古老的精灵狩猎小屋的遗址上，这片土地在400多年前的大撤退后被一位贵族家族所拥有。因此，这片土地归豪尔赞格家族所有，他们曾在不同时期向伊利里亚、特里奥洛共和国、梅拉纳自治区以及（最常见的）玛格达王国效忠。豪尔赞格家族在政治上总是相当熟练，并倾向于一种不雄心勃勃的政策：“请让我们和我们的书籍、鹰和狩猎保持独处”。如果不是因为他们控制着血色乌鸦魔力线并且愿意惹恼森林中的仙族领主和女士，豪尔赞格家族可能一直只是一个脚注。",
	"Originally, the pretty lodge was visited each summer and fall for boar hunts, chasing deer in the White Forest, and fish-hawking along the Templine riverbanks. The family realized the road to the lodge could also be utilized for timber transport, so the lodge became the manor for a new lumber village along the river. The lodge itself remained a place of blissful seclusion, though with some ability to gather servitors, various goods, and skilled craftspeople from the village.": "最初，这座漂亮的小屋每年夏秋季都会迎来猎野猪、在白色森林中追逐鹿群，以及沿着坦普林河岸进行捕鱼的游客。这个家族意识到通往小屋的道路也可以用于运输木材，因此小屋成为了沿河一座新木材村庄的庄园。小屋本身仍然是一个幸福隐居的地方，尽管可以从村庄中聚集仆人、各种商品和熟练的手艺人。",
	"This village was named Redleaf. At first, they sold their finest oak, ash, and rowan either east to the city of Melana or north to the Magdar merchants for barrels, barge masts, and much else. The trade was not without problems (the forest fey included some alseid and bothersome druids), but in all, it was a worthwhile little fiefdom for the Holzangers. Over time, the village grew, and then Gerhardt Holzanger came along, the first of the Holzanger sorcerers.": "这个村庄被命名为红叶村。起初，他们将最好的橡木、白蜡树和欧白山梨树卖给东边的城市梅拉纳或北边的马格达商人，用于制作桶、驳船桅杆等物品。贸易并非没有问题（森林精灵中包括一些阿尔赛德和讨厌的德鲁伊），但总体来说，对于霍尔赞格家族来说，这是一个值得的小封地。随着时间的推移，村庄不断壮大，然后格哈特·霍尔赞格出现了，他是霍尔赞格家族的第一位巫师。",
	"About 250 years ago, the young Holzanger discovered a rich ley-line tributary nearby, connecting easily to the White Road to the south and (with only modest arcane rituals) also to the shadow road to the northwest and even (with rather more strenuous and blood-soaked rituals) to the ancient Pontoretto ley line of Valera and its elven lords. The ley line itself seemed to pool and gather strength near the hunting lodge more than at the village itself, and the isolated lodge was a good place for experiments that often involved chanting, arcane lights, and the strange smells of alchemical enhancements and distillations.": "大约250年前，年轻的霍尔赞格（Holzanger）发现了附近一条丰富的地脉支流，与南部的白色之路（White Road）轻松连接，（只需适度的奥术仪式）还能与西北部的暗影之路连接，甚至（通过更加艰苦和血腥的仪式）能够连接到瓦莱拉（Valera）的古老庞托雷托（Pontoretto）地脉及其精灵领主。地脉本身似乎更多地在狩猎小屋附近汇聚和聚集力量，而不是在村庄本身，这座偏僻的小屋是进行经常涉及吟唱、奥术光芒和炼金增强以及蒸馏的奇怪气味实验的好地方。",
	"Gerhardt kept his secret for almost ten years until he took an apprentice who later ran away to Schio and told his tale. A ley line that might connect other ley lines! Ley-line philters and encasements that reacted to Void power, radiant magic, and shadow! Ley-line distillations that gave his cruel master much added strength of body and mind! The tales were wild and had the effect that the apprentice Waldmer intended—the privacy of the White Forest Lodge was a thing of the past.": "格哈特（Gerhardt）保守了他的秘密将近十年，直到他收了一名学徒，后来学徒逃到斯基奥（Schio）并讲述了他的故事。一条可能连接其他地脉线（ley lines）的地脉线！对虚空能量、光辉魔法和阴影有反应的地脉线过滤器和封装！地脉线蒸馏物给他残酷的主人带来了更强大的身体和头脑！这些故事荒诞不经，产生了学徒瓦尔德默（Waldmer）打算达到的效果——白色森林小屋的隐私成为过去时。",
	"With the wider understanding of the discovery, the area was suddenly of interest to geomancers, the shadow fey, and darker forces who wished to travel the fey roads between the three lines, plumb the mysteries of why": "随着对这一发现的更广泛理解，这个地区突然引起了风水师、影子精灵和那些希望穿越三线之间的精灵之路、探究其中奥秘的更黑暗的势力的兴趣。",
	"this backwater might connect ley lines in this way, and discover how this strong ley line might be harnessed. The first few visitors were greeted politely and told to go away. Later visitors were treated as foes. Over the years, the hunting lodge—at the ley line's strongest point—was rebuilt with the red stone common to the area, first as a single tower and then as a small keep.": "这个偏远之地也许以这种方式连接了地脉，发现这条强大的地脉如何被利用。最初的几位访客受到礼貌的招待，然后被告知离开。后来的访客被视为敌人。多年来，在地脉最强的地方，狩猎小屋被重新建造，使用了当地常见的红色石头，起初是一座孤立的塔楼，然后是一个小堡垒。",
	"Arcane secrets were under frequent investigation. Gerhardt Holzanger grew rich taking on various comely, cunning, and willing apprentices (some believe {@book Arshin the Enchanter|W02DM|3}—see {@loader Warlock #2|collection/Kobold Press; Warlock 02 Dread Magic.json}—was one of them, more long-lived than most) and having built his redstone castle on the site of the ley line's greatest resonance and generally making the most of it. He bound himself to the ley line, giving himself and his children greater strength in using its magic but also making it difficult to wander far from the Wandering Crow. At first, he could travel as far as Zigistad, Melana, and Triolo itself, but over time, this narrowed to Peltzenheim and the town of Erdovar (before its ruin) and Schio. Some believe this same ritual binds the master of Demon Mountain to his own domicile, granting him great power in a highly limited space.": "奥秘经常受到频繁调查。格哈德特·霍尔赞格（Gerhardt Holzanger）通过接纳各种美丽、狡猾且乐意的学徒而变得富有（有人认为{@book Arshin the Enchanter|W02DM|3}—见{@loader Warlock #2|collection/Kobold Press; Warlock 02 Dread Magic.json}—是其中之一，比大多数人活得更久），他在地脉共振最强的地方建造了他的红石城堡，并充分利用了这一点。他将自己与地脉绑定，使自己和他的子女在使用其魔法时更强大，但也使自己难以远离“流浪乌鸦”。起初，他可以前往齐吉斯塔德、梅拉娜和特里奥洛本身，但随着时间的推移，这一范围缩小到佩尔岑海姆和埃尔多瓦镇（在其毁灭之前）以及斯基奥。有人认为，同样的仪式将恶魔山的主人与他自己的住所绑定在一起，在高度有限的空间内赋予他巨大的力量。",
	"Despite the lack of travel, Gerhardt's private ley line offered strength and the seemingly boundless ability to study, learn, and tinker, delighting first Gerhardt and then his progeny (his wife was one Edelfrieda the Golden, said to be a druid, a sorceress, or an elfmarked petty noble of Dornig—some insist on all three). Within the reach of the White Forest, first Gerhardt the Elder and then Gerhardt the Younger and then Gertruda and Gunthar and Gerhardt III all had control over the ley lines, countering any foe or assassin skillfully, inventing new ways to charm a friend or turn an enemy into a bug. Over generations, their interests delved deep into newts and amphibians, and then the family became obsessed with horology, celestial mechanics, flotation and levitation, night creatures, angelic languages, and on and on. Always seeking knowledge purely to possess it, rarely using it to better their small barony or even to enrich themselves or their peasantry.": "尽管无法旅行，格哈特的私人地脉线提供了力量，似乎无限的学习、探索和动手能力，先是让格哈特感到愉悦，然后是他的后代（他的妻子是一位名为埃德尔弗里达·黄金的德鲁伊，据说她是多尼格的一位被认为是德鲁伊、巫师或精灵印记的小贵族——有人坚持说她具备这三种身份）。在白色森林的范围内，先是老格哈特，然后是年轻的格哈特，接着是格特鲁达和冈萨尔，以及格哈特三世，他们都掌控着地脉线，熟练地对抗任何敌人或刺客，创造新的方法来迷惑朋友或将敌人变成虫子。随着世代的传承，他们的兴趣深入研究蝾螈和两栖动物，然后家族变得着迷于钟表学、天体力学、浮力和悬浮、夜间生物、天使语言等等。他们总是追求知识，纯粹是为了拥有它，很少用它来改善他们的小领地，甚至不用来丰富自己或他们的农民。",
	"For a brief period, the area was quasi-independent, and each Holzanger sorcerer styled himself the \"Baron of Citarossa, Lord of the White Forest, and Master of the Scarlet Citadel.\" So it went for nigh 200 years: always a tiny power, always independent, though sometimes paying tribute to one power or another, and always a strange little oddity known mostly to merchants, timberfolk, and the southern Magdar villages.": "在一个短暂的时期内，这个地区几乎是独立的，每位Holzanger巫师都自称为\"西塔罗萨男爵，白色森林之主，绯红城堡大师\"。如此持续了近200年：始终是微弱的力量，始终独立，尽管有时向某个势力纳贡，但始终是一个奇怪的小怪异存在，主要为商人、木材工人和南部Magdar村庄所知。",
	"However, their overweening pride and power drew attention, and in time, an unexpected arrival ended the first age of the citadel roughly 150 years ago.": "然而，他们过分的骄傲和权力引起了注意，在一段时间后，一位意想不到的到来者结束了大约150年前的堡垒第一时代。",
	"The dwarves of the cantons and of the city-state of Melana are makers, forgers of steel, imbuing weapons with the power of Mavros and Svarog—and even Ninkash and Rava—and durable armor, enchanted barrels, and wondrous works in gold, steel, and stone. A few dwarves though, especially those of Nordmansch and Alpentor, still hew to the older ways, forging rings of surpassing power and loveliness, alive with the circling strength of runes, binding raw arcane might and turning it to fire and shadow, to glamours as durable as stone.": "卡顿（Cantons）和城邦（Melana）的矮人是钢铁的制造者、铸造者，赋予武器玛弗洛斯（Mavros）和斯瓦罗格（Svarog）——甚至宁卡什（Ninkash）和拉娃（Rava）的力量，以及耐用的护甲、附魔桶和黄金、钢铁和石头的奇妙作品。然而，一些矮人，尤其是来自诺德曼斯奇（Nordmansch）和阿尔彭托尔（Alpentor）的人，仍然坚持传统的方式，锻造出具有超凡力量和美丽的戒指，活力四射，环绕着符文的力量，将原始奥术力量捆绑并转化为火焰和阴影，制造出坚固如石头的幻术。",
	"These dwarves, the ring wardens and the ring mystics, are the keepers of lore said to have been handed down by bearded Wotan himself. Their understanding of embodying magic in physical form is rarely surpassed, and they took a keen interest in House Holzanger. When the human house was weak, they showed up one day, told Gerhardt III they would be his new soldiers and providers, and somehow either charmed him (some say the gift of an enchanted ring secured Gerhardt III's cooperation) or won him through bribery (others say the ring mystics shared their secrets of binding arcane essences into circular form and that Gerhardt himself forged dozens of powerful rings in this manner).": "这些矮人，戒指守护者和戒指秘术师，是传说中由有胡子的沃坦(Wotan)传承下来的知识守护者。他们对将魔法具现化的理解很少有人能超越，他们对霍尔赞格家族(House Holzanger)表现出浓厚的兴趣。当人类家族虚弱时，他们某天出现，告诉格哈德三世(Gerhardt III)他们将成为他的新士兵和供应者，并以某种方式迷住了他（有人说是一枚魔法戒指的礼物确保了格哈德三世的合作），或者通过贿赂赢得了他（其他人说戒指秘术师分享了将奥术精华绑定成圆形的秘密，而格哈德本人以此方式锻造了数十枚强大的戒指）。",
	"In either case, suddenly there was a company of one hundred dwarves and a half-dozen ring mages in the village of Redleaf—and many arguments with the locals over the paucity of ale and proper sausages. The dwarves chased down and tamed owlbears as hunting animals and guardians for the newly built Dwarf Hall in the village, a fine dwarven-style structure with a lookout tower. A palisade was raised to protect the village from woodland raiders. And relations between villagers and dwarves never improved. The dwarves followed Ninkash a bit too closely, often drunk and pissing in the streets or singing their endless songs late at night. The dwarven hall was a bit too fine and too imposing. Brawls were common, though the humans had much the worst of it. Complaints to Baron Gerhardt went unheeded. The owlbears ate local goats and chickens and even a beloved dog.": "在任何情况下，突然间在红叶村出现了一百个半人高的矮人和六个戒指法师，与当地居民就酒精和合适香肠的稀缺问题发生了许多争执。矮人们追捕并驯服猫头鹰熊作为狩猎动物和新建的矮人大厅的守护者，这是一座精美的矮人风格建筑，带有一个瞭望塔。村子周围筑起了栅栏，以防止森林袭击者。村民和矮人之间的关系从未改善。矮人们对尼卡什(Ninkash)的追随有些过于紧密，经常喝醉酒、在街上小便，或在深夜唱着他们无休止的歌曲。矮人大厅有些过于精致和过于威严。斗殴很常见，尽管人类受到了更严重的打击。对格哈德男爵的投诉被置之不理。猫头鹰熊吃掉了当地的山羊、鸡甚至一只可爱的狗。",
	"One night, while most of the dwarves were digging at the old Scarlet Manor Hall, the Dwarf Hall burned to the ground. The streets of the village of Redleaf glowed brightly, and the humans sang their own songs of Khors. Some of the Redleaf druids and doughtier men-at-arms mused about throwing the dwarves out entirely and \"rescuing\" Baron Gerhardt from their evil influences.": "在一个晚上，当大多数矮人在挖掘旧的猩红庄园大厅时，矮人大厅被烧毁了。红叶村的街道明亮地发光，人类唱着他们自己的Khors之歌。一些红叶德鲁伊和勇敢的武士们在思考是否应该将矮人彻底赶出去，并“拯救”从他们邪恶影响中“拯救”Gerhardt男爵。",
	"Baron Gerhardt finally saw the danger of further strife between the humans and dwarves. He called the dwarves to stay at the manor house and keep and told them to build it into a finer citadel with a new name: the Scarlet Citadel. The owlbears left the village of Redleaf to live with the dwarves, coming to the riverside village only occasionally when the baron's dwarves came calling. These grim-faced dwarves came twice a year to collect taxes or gather up barrels of ale from Peltzenheim or to send furs to their dwarven brothers in Melana and Brescia. The dungeons beneath the Scarlet Citadel were vastly expanded and improved to include owlbear stables, barracks, shrines to dwarven gods, and a vast library and workspace carved out for the Holzangers.": "Gerhardt男爵终于意识到人类和矮人之间进一步冲突的危险。他召集了矮人们留在庄园，并告诉他们将其建设成一个更好的城堡，并赋予其新名称：血色城堡。猫头鹰熊离开了Redleaf村庄去和矮人们一起生活，只有在男爵的矮人们前来时偶尔会来到河畔村庄。这些面色阴沉的矮人们每年两次前来征收税款或从Peltzenheim收集酒桶，或者将毛皮送往他们在Melana和Brescia的矮人兄弟那里。血色城堡下的地牢得到了大规模扩建和改善，包括猫头鹰熊的马厩、兵营、矮人神的神龛，以及为Holzangers开凿出的广阔图书馆和工作空间。",
	"The dwarves brought more than rings and owlbears to the Scarlet Citadel. They also brought the faith of Charun the Boatman with them from Melana, and over time, they connected some elements of the citadel with the Black River of Tears, sacred to Charun and said to be a source of connection between the mortal world and Yggdrasil or between Midgard and the many realms of the outer planes.": "矮人们不仅仅带来了戒指和猫头鹰熊到血色城堡。 他们还从梅拉纳带来了船夫卡伦(Charun the Boatman)的信仰，并随着时间的推移，他们将城堡的一些元素与泪水之河(Black River of Tears)联系在一起，这条河对卡伦而言是神圣的，据说是连接凡间世界与世界树(Yggdrasil)或者连接米德加德(Midgard)与外域众多位面之间的一处联系之源。",
	"About 130 years ago, the dwarves of the Scarlet Citadel grew impatient with what seemed like plentiful coin and ale, plus the fine magical treasures they occasionally gained from the Holzangers. Tired of hunting and guarding and drinking, and led by the canny Captain {@creature Chansar the Pale|KPSC}, they began to take empty carts pulled by enormous tamed owlbears out to the Schio-Wagenstein Road where they plundered merchants and rolled away with fine steel from Melana, copper bars, leather hides from Trombei, spices from Triolo, barrels of salt fish from Friula, and strings of Septime coin. This banditry was small at first—a trader here, a lone peddler there—but it quickly grew into a business of serious danger for trade between the Seven Cities and the Crossroads.": "大约130年前，猩红城堡的矮人们对看似丰富的金币和啤酒，以及偶尔从霍尔赞格家族那里获得的精美魔法宝物感到不耐烦。厌倦了狩猎、守卫和饮酒的生活，在精明的队长{@creature Chansar the Pale|KPSC}的带领下，他们开始驾驭巨大的驯养猫头鹰熊拉着空车前往席奥-瓦根斯坦大道，劫掠商人，抢走来自梅拉纳的精钢、来自特罗姆贝的铜条、来自特里奥洛的香料、来自弗里乌拉的盐鱼桶和一串串的塞普蒂姆硬币。这种抢劫起初规模很小——这里的一名商人，那里的一名孤立的小贩——但很快就发展成了对七城和十字路口之间贸易的严重威胁的生意。",
	"Trade is always dangerous of course, especially among the Septime cities, so the usual precautions were taken. Merchants hired guards, which slowed the banditry but made some trade quite difficult; the price of salt fish won't support a squadron of lancers. Rewards were posted.": "贸易当然是危险的，尤其是在七月城市中，因此采取了通常的预防措施。商人雇佣了护卫，这减少了抢劫，但也使一些贸易变得相当困难；盐鱼的价格支持不了一队枪骑兵。悬赏令被张贴出来。",
	"For years, various cantonal dwarves and the dwarves of Melana were blamed, for the canny dwarves of the Scarlet Citadel displayed shields and banners of Tijino, Juralt, and Melana or of famous mercenary companies within the Seven Cities. In time, however, it became clear these dwarves lived to the east of the road, and they operated from some stronghold in the White Forest. Given the notorious strength of the forest's owlbears and the well-known dangers of the sorcerers of the Scarlet Citadel taking offense at trespassers, the merchants all agreed that someone else should seek out the bandit stronghold and put a stop to the whole mess. The rewards grew larger.": "多年来，各个州的侏儒和梅拉纳的侏儒都受到指责，因为血色城堡的狡猾侏儒展示了提吉诺、朱拉特和梅拉纳的盾牌和旗帜，或者展示了七城内著名雇佣兵公司的标志。然而，随着时间的推移，很明显这些侏儒住在道路的东边，并且他们在白色森林的某个据点活动。鉴于白色森林猫头鹰熊的臭名昭著的力量，以及众所周知的血色城堡的巫师对闯入者的危险，商人们一致同意应该让其他人去寻找强盗据点并制止整个混乱。奖励也变得更加丰厚。",
	"The end of the bandit era came in a different way when canny Captain Chansar bragged a bit too loudly at Redleaf's tavern, the Cage. A young squire of the Faithful Knights of Khors was visiting the village as part of a simple devotional journey to the shrine there, and she overheard this boasting about pillaging a full mule train, so Squire Emmalyn told her sergeant of the bragging dwarven bandit. The paladins and faithful knights of Khors had recently had one of their own wine shipments from the Smolten Hills plundered by bandits, and the order's commander was incensed. A wing of knights, a squad of the Wands of Khors battle mages, and the high priest of Khors in Zigistad himself all followed the young squire Emmalyn into the White Forest to Redleaf village and then to the citadel.": "土匪时代的结束以不同的方式来临，当精明的卡普坦查恩萨在雷德利夫的酒馆，铁笼里有些夸夸其谈时。一位忠诚骑士团的年轻侍从正在该村庄进行一次简单的朝圣之旅，她无意中听到了这位矮人土匪吹嘘掠夺了一整列骡子队的事情，于是侍从艾玛琳告诉了她的中士这位吹嘘的矮人土匪。Khors忠诚骑士团最近有一批来自Smolten Hills的葡萄酒被土匪抢劫，该团的指挥官感到愤怒。一支骑士分队，一队Khors战斗法师团的魔杖，以及Zigistad的Khors高阶祭司本人都跟随年轻侍从艾玛琳进入白色森林，前往雷德利夫村庄，然后前往城堡。",
	"When the dwarves refused to hand over Captain Chansar and his accomplices to the king's justice and the mercy of Khors, the knights laid siege to the citadel for a month. In time, owlbears within the citadel ate all there was to eat, and canny Chansar sent the starving beasts out the citadel gate, expecting to make short work of the knights. He was quite mistaken; High Priest Tadeas Toller struck the owlbears with holy fire, the Wands of Khors unleashed lightning, and the countercharge carried the knights into the citadel courtyard.": "当矮人们拒绝将Chansar船长和他的同谋交给国王的审判和Khors的仁慈时，骑士们围攻了这座城堡一个月。随着时间的推移，城堡内的猫头鹰熊吃光了所有食物，精明的Chansar将饥饿的野兽送出城堡大门，期望迅速解决骑士们。他大错特错了；Tadeas Toller高阶祭司用神圣之火击打猫头鹰熊，Khors之杖释放闪电，反击将骑士们带入了城堡庭院。",
	"The battle might yet have gone to the dwarves with their crossbows firing into the courtyard from well- built arrow slits if not for the fine timbers of the keep catching fire when a lucky fireball went through an arrow slit into the interior. The Scarlet Citadel floors, stairs, rafters, and tapestries burned bright and strong, and the conflagration quickly poured smoke into the buildings, the dungeons, and the courtyard. It became impossible to shoot through the smoke and soon to breathe within the tower. The smoke and flames drove a few dwarves into the deeper tunnels, though most were forced to surrender to the waiting company of knights. Captain Chansar's body was never found, and his ring mystic lieutenant Valence Hellhand is known to have survived and fled to Nordmansch. The citadel walls still stood, blackened with smoke, and the dungeons below were no longer home to dozens of owlbears.": "如果不是一颗幸运的火球穿过箭孔进入内部，点燃了要塞的优质木材，战斗可能会由于矮人们从箭孔中向庭院射击的弩箭而转向矮人一方。绯红城堡的地板、楼梯、横梁和挂毯燃烧得明亮而猛烈，大火迅速向建筑物、地牢和庭院中涌入浓烟。射击穿过浓烟变得不可能，很快在塔内也无法呼吸。浓烟和火焰迫使一些矮人逃入更深的隧道，尽管大多数被迫向等待的骑士队投降。查恩萨队长的尸体从未被找到，而他的戒指神秘中尉瓦伦斯·赫尔汉德已知幸存并逃往诺德曼斯。城堡墙壁仍然屹立，被浓烟熏黑，地下的地牢不再是数十只猫头鹰熊的家园。",
	"But the age of the Scarlet Citadel as a functional fortress was over and done, and the cracked, blackened mortar and missing rafters meant the walls themselves were weakened. Soon other inhabitants came to the citadel, and the villagers of Redleaf came to gather up useful stone blocks and take them by wagon to reinforce their own keep and palisade. These scarlet stones were carried for miles and used with care. And one morning, a mysterious red tower was erected, making such a fine impression overlooking the village, which was soon renamed Redtower, and it has kept that name ever since.": "但是，猩红城堡作为一个功能性要塞的时代已经结束，裂开的、烧黑的砂浆和缺失的椽子意味着墙壁本身已经变得脆弱。很快，其他居民来到了城堡，红叶村的村民们来收集有用的石块，并用马车将它们运到自己的城堡和栅栏中加固。这些猩红色的石块被远远地搬运并小心使用。一天早晨，一座神秘的红色塔楼被建立起来，俯瞰着村庄，给人留下了深刻的印象，村庄很快就改名为红塔镇，从那时起就一直保持着这个名字。",
	"The sack of the Scarlet Citadel affected the village of Redtower very little indeed. Timber was still cut, some logs rafted down to Triolo to build the fleets, many of the finest timbers going north to the Magdar plain for houses, barrels—all the things for which stout oak, maple, and ash are most prized. A few arcanists came to sniff around at the ruins, though most left quickly once they met the feral owlbears or were vexed by the sprites and pixies and alseid who guarded the forest paths against intruders.": "红塔村的斯卡雷特城堡被洗劫对村庄影响甚微。木材仍在被砍伐，一些原木被筏送到特里奥洛（Triolo）用于建造舰队，许多最优质的木材被送往马格达平原（Magdar plain）用于建造房屋、桶等一切需要坚固橡木、枫木和白蜡树的物品。一些奥术师前来探查废墟，尽管大多数在遇到野生猫头鹰熊或被精灵、小妖精和阿尔赛德（alseid）阻挡森林小径的入侵者后很快就离开了。",
	"However, one group came not by forest path but by shadow road, powered by the Wandering Crow ley line. These were the cultists of Charun, the boatman between the living and the dead, whose followers took a pilgrimage from Kammae-Straboli along the Black River (as they call their temples' shadow roads) and wound up underneath the citadel. The whole company of pilgrims was quite confused at first, but the shadow-fey wizard Quendreth the  Wise immediately saw the power and strange geomantic convergence of the site. He insisted a shrine be built immediately, and he brought in shadow-fey guards and mages to embed it with power and bind the ley line.": "然而，有一群人并非通过森林小道而是通过暗影之路来到这里，他们受流浪乌鸦(Ley Line)的力量驱动。这些人是查伦(Charun)的教徒，他是生者和死者之间的船夫，他的追随者们从坎迈-斯特拉博利(Kammae-Straboli)沿着黑河前来朝圣（他们称之为他们神庙的暗影之路），最终来到了城堡下方。起初，所有朝圣者都感到困惑，但暗影精灵巫师智者昆德雷斯(Quendreth the Wise)立刻看出了这个地点的力量和奇特的地理能量汇聚。他坚持立即建造一座神龛，并带来暗影精灵卫士和法师，将其注入力量并绑定这条(Ley Line)。",
	"The small community could not find its way back to Kammae via the river, but with Quendreth's help, they did establish shadow-river connections far and wide, both deep into the Shadow Realm and to the three titanic ley lines to the west, north, and southeast. Sometimes the Black River flowed south, powered the Wandering Crow to the White Road and thus to Revskaya, Raguza, Achillon, and occasionally Harkesh. Other seasons brought connections west and north to Brescia and St. Mischau along the shadow road, and once even to Zobeck. The most difficult connections were those along the Pontoretto, sometimes to Trombei and sometimes as far as Capleon. Charun's faithful used the Black River connection quietly and without fuss, retaining it as a secret of the deeper initiates of the Temple of Charun. And even to those who never traveled the shadow rivers, it knit the community together with a physical embodiment of their faith, though only Quendreth truly seemed to understand how to pilot a vessel to connect the shadow roads, a secret he shared with no others. Or at least with no humans.": "这个小社区无法通过河流找回到卡玛埃，但在昆德雷斯的帮助下，他们确实建立了遍布遥远的影子河连接，深入到暗影界，以及通往西部、北部和东南部三条巨大的魔力线。有时，黑河向南流动，为漫游乌鸦提供动力，进而通往白路，然后到达雷夫斯卡亚、拉古扎、阿基隆，偶尔还有哈克什。其他季节会带来通往西部和北部的连接，沿着影子之路到布雷西亚和圣米绍，甚至有一次到了佐贝克。最困难的连接是沿着蓬托雷托，有时通往特罗姆贝，有时甚至远至卡普利昂。查伦的信徒们默默地利用黑河连接，保持它作为查伦神殿深层入门者的秘密。即使那些从未游历过暗影河流的人，它也用实体的方式将社区联系在一起，体现了他们的信仰，尽管只有昆德雷斯似乎真正懂得如何驾驶船只连接影子之路，这是他与其他人，或者至少是与其他人类，分享的秘密。",
	"With the cult of Charun ensconced in the lower levels of the citadel, trading with inhabitants of the underworld and using the ley line to strengthen its presence from the Seven Cities to the heart of the Dragon Empire, things changed. The arcane power of the Holzangers was passed to the Boatman's followers. Quendreth was suddenly held in high esteem among the congregants who had once made their pilgrimages entirely on the surface world, and he was granted the title of Ferryman within the church. A period of fifteen years kept him at the forefront of Charun's works over a vast territory.": "随着(Charun教派)在城堡的下层安家落户，与地底居民进行贸易，并利用地脉从七城到龙帝国核心地带加强其存在，情况发生了变化。霍尔赞格家族的奥术力量传承给了(船夫)的追随者。昆德雷在曾经完全在地表世界进行朝圣的教众中突然备受尊敬，并被授予了教会内的(渡船人)头衔。在接下来的十五年里，他在广阔领土上一直处于(Charun)事业的前沿。",
	"Alas, Quendreth was as susceptible to hubris and arrogance as many of the shadow fey, and he dabbled in Void magic, opening portals to other planes entirely, speaking to demons and devils, and inviting the satarre priestess Miskra ai-Vellec to advise him. This went about as well as you might expect, for even a less zealous priestess such as Miskra was delighted to have such power in her hands—a tool for her own plans—though she also shared much lore with Quendreth, and the two were allies of convenience for a decade. In time though, the satarre Void cultists and the true believers of Charun fell out with each other, but not before Miskra realized she could use the waters of the Black River for certain dark rituals and malign enchantments. In time, the Void cult arrived in force, and Quendreth was forced to leave quickly.": "然而，可惜的是，昆德雷思和许多暗影精灵一样，容易骄傲自大，他涉足虚空魔法，打开通往其他位面的传送门，与恶魔和魔鬼交谈，并邀请了萨塔雷祭司密斯卡·艾-维莱克为他提供建议。这一切发展如你所料，即使像密斯卡这样不那么狂热的祭司也很高兴拥有这样的力量——这对她自己的计划来说是一个工具——尽管她也与昆德雷分享了许多知识，两人在接下来的十年里是便利的盟友。然而，随着时间的推移，萨塔雷虚空教徒和真正信仰卡伦的人发生了分歧，但在此之前，密斯卡意识到她可以利用黑河的水进行某些黑暗仪式和邪恶魔法。最终，虚空教徒大举而来，昆德雷被迫匆匆离开。",
	"When the shadow-fey wizard departed, he did {@i something} to the ley line that entirely removed its ability to easily connect to the Pontoretto or the shadow road, and its connection to the White Road remained spotty at best. At the same time, Quendreth brought one of the Holzangers back to the Scarlet Citadel—the child of Gerhardt IV—to hold the place and the White Forest in perpetuity (more precisely until their return). He was called Gerhardt the Changeling and had a definite elfmarked look to him. He lived for one hundred years, and at age 70, he took a human wife from Raguza, said to be a pirate captain and certainly a hellraiser. Her name was Melanchia the Reaver, and {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} is her son.": "当影影精灵巫师离开时，他对完全移除了其轻松连接到Pontoretto或影之路的能力的地脉做了{@i something}，而其与白色之路的连接至多也只是断断续续。与此同时，Quendreth带了一个Holzangers回到了猩红城堡——格哈德四世的孩子——来永久守护这个地方和白色森林（更准确地说是直到他们的返回）。他被称为变形者格哈德，看起来明显有着精灵的特征。他活了一百年，在70岁时，他娶了来自拉古扎的人类妻子，据说是一名海盗船长，绝对是一个惹事精。她的名字是掠夺者梅兰奇亚，{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}是她的儿子。",
	"In the current age, {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} is a man of years and deep experience, certainly an older sorcerer, though still full of wild energy and fanciful plans, always striving to learn something new and keep the power of the citadel close. He is frankly too forgetful to always remember to chase away some of the Charun River cultists or to seal the Void portal when he's done with it, and horrible things creep into the citadel without him really paying attention. His son and daughter—Garent and Vespertina—are said to await the day he dies and his personal bond to the Wandering Crow ends, giving them power to use ley-line energies for their friends among the fey and the cults.": "在当前时代，{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} 是一位年迈且经验丰富的人，无疑是一位年长的巫师，尽管仍充满着狂野的能量和奇特的计划，始终努力学习新事物，并保持着对城堡力量的掌控。他实在太过健忘，无法始终记得要赶走一些查伦河邪教徒，或者在使用虚空传送门后将其封印，因此一些可怕的事物在他不太留意的情况下潜入了城堡。据说他的儿子和女儿——加伦特(Garent)和夜莓(Vespertina)——正在等待他去世的那一天，等待他与流浪乌鸦的个人联系结束，这将赋予他们使用地脉能量为精灵和邪教友人提供力量的能力。",
	"The decaying dungeons, crypts, and stones of the old Scarlet Citadel remain to be explored, their many years of rich magic interwoven with blood and betrayal. Surely some great treasures still remain, and a few of the inhabitants of Redtower—perhaps those who remember when it was Redleaf—can point a daring soul in the right direction or warn of some of its better-known dangers.": "古老的绯红城堡中的腐朽地牢、地下墓穴和石头仍待探索，其中众多年代悠久的丰富魔法与血腥和背叛交织在一起。肯定还有一些伟大的宝藏尚未被发现，而红塔的一些居民——也许是那些记得它曾经是红叶的人——可以指引一个勇敢的灵魂朝正确的方向前进，或者警告一些众所周知的危险。",
	"The town of Redtower has grown somewhat since its days as the village of Redleaf, adjusting to and even taking advantage of the new influx of adventurers, but it still has much of the same rustic, self-determined earnestness that it always had. Located on a tributary of the Templine River in southern Magdar between Peltzenheim and Schio, Redtower is an unremarkable logging settlement by itself but is better known as a launching point for adventuring expeditions into the infamous ruined castle and cave complex nearby—the Scarlet Citadel.": "红塔镇（Redtower）自从它作为红叶村（Redleaf）的日子以来已经有所发展，适应甚至利用了新一波冒险者的涌入，但它仍然保留着与往常一样的乡村风情和自主决心。红塔镇位于玛格达南部Templine河的一条支流上，介于Peltzenheim和Schio之间。红塔镇本身是一个普普通通的伐木定居点，但更为人所知的是作为冒险远征的起点，前往附近臭名昭著的废墟城堡和洞穴群——血色城堡（the Scarlet Citadel）的探险。",
	"Approaching Redtower from the northwest goes through lowland prairie toward the White Forest where Redtower is nestled within the tree line. A wooden palisade surrounds most of the town with platforms and small watchtowers attached to the palisade at each entrance. On the far southeastern corner of town, a curious redstone tower rises over the wall, itself connected to the wall via rampart. A small tributary of the Templine flows from the southwest to the northeast on the far side of town.": "从西北方向接近（Redtower）红塔，穿过低地草原，前往白色森林，红塔就隐藏在树线中。一个木栅栏环绕着镇子的大部分区域，每个入口处都附有平台和小瞭望塔。在镇子的远东南角，一座奇特的红石塔矗立在墙上，通过城墙与墙相连。一条小支流从镇子的西南流向东北，流经镇子的远端。",
	"Redtower's principal export is lumber, but the residents have adopted an entrepreneurial spirit around its status as an adventurers' destination. While many townsfolk are honest, pioneering people, it also houses plenty of opportunists looking to take advantage of adventurers flush with coin. Redtower thrives off this sort of \"adventure tourism,\" simultaneously warning travelers away from the Scarlet Citadel while peddling wares guaranteed to—supposedly—allow them to survive it. While predatory, these adventure peddlers are not lying about the dangers of the citadel: everyone in Redtower knows few who venture into the citadel ever return.": "红塔城(`Redtower`)的主要出口是木材，但居民们已经在作为冒险者目的地的地位周围形成了一种创业精神。虽然许多镇民是诚实、开拓精神的人，但也有很多机会主义者想要利用那些身怀金币的冒险者。红塔城依靠这种“冒险旅游”而繁荣，同时警告游客远离(`Scarlet Citadel`)，同时兜售能够——据说——让他们在其中生存的商品。尽管具有掠夺性，这些冒险推销员并没有在谈论城堡的危险时说谎：红塔城的每个人都知道很少有人冒险进入城堡后能够返回。",

	"Ley lines abound in the area, many of them weak and uncharted. Investigating these ley lines or the inert shadow gate nearby could be a reason for the party's interest.": "该地区充满了地脉线，其中许多是微弱且未被探索的。调查这些地脉线或附近的不活跃的暗影之门可能会成为冒险小组感兴趣的原因。",
	"Goblins and bandits are common around Redtower, particularly along the roads where they harass traveling merchants. The party could be working to quell these attacks.": "红塔附近的地精和土匪很常见，特别是在道路上，他们经常骚扰旅行商人。队伍可以努力制止这些袭击。",
	"The town of Redtower welcomes you.": "红塔镇欢迎你。",
	"Redtower's stables stretch along the northwest palisade just outside the front gate.

	"A cluster of stately buildings embraces travelers coming from the northwest into Redtower, of which the town hall is the largest.

	"If the party doesn't visit town hall on their own, Wislaw sends them an invitation within a day of their arrival to Redtower. When they arrive, he's eager to make the acquaintance of these new adventurers in town; he makes pleasant conversation, plies them with food and drink, and welcomes their expedition. He plays up the threat of the Scarlet Citadel and the dangers roaming the woods but assures them they're in the best place to get equipped to face it. He claims to be so impressed that he authorizes them to use his name at the local merchants for a \"special\" discount.": "如果队伍没有主动去市政厅，Wislaw会在他们到达Redtower的第二天内发送邀请。当他们到达时，他急切地想要结识这些新来的冒险者；他进行愉快的交谈，款待他们食物和饮料，并欢迎他们的探险。他夸大了朱红城堡的威胁以及漫游在树林中的危险，但保证他们在这里是获得装备来面对它的最佳地方。他声称对他们印象深刻，授权他们在当地商人那里使用他的名字以获得“特别”折扣。",
	"Dropping Wislaw's name among the merchants is actually a signal that the characters are promising marks, and the merchant raises their prices accordingly and gives the mayor a cut. Raise the cost of goods and services by 10% whenever the PCs use the mayor's name; if they inquire, merchants explain demand is too high in Redtower, and without the mayor's go-ahead, prices would be higher. Otherwise, goods and services are priced as normal.": "在商人中提到Wislaw的名字实际上是一个信号，表明这些角色是有潜力的目标，商人会相应地提高价格并给市长一部分。每当PCs使用市长的名字时，将商品和服务的成本提高10%；如果他们询问，商人会解释在Redtower需求太高，没有市长的同意，价格会更高。否则，商品和服务的定价如常。",

	"Between the Cage Tavern ({@area R4|SC-R4|x}) and town hall ({@area R2|SC-R2|x}) is a prominent landmark in the town's center: a disused temple of Khors. The octagonal walls of the temple remain strong, as do the stoic-faced knightly statues flanking the doors on the temple's northwest face. Once inside, the temple's neglect is obvious: the elements have partially eroded the roof, leading to a section of collapse just beyond the door. Despite the added debris, the stone pews and large frescoes inside the temple are mostly intact, as is the altar standing at the southeast wall. The temple sits on a large patch of cleared, flat land intended for use as a training ground, but nature is reclaiming it with patches of grass and wildflowers.": "在笼子酒馆({@area R4|SC-R4|x})和市政厅({@area R2|SC-R2|x})之间是镇中心的一个显著地标：一座废弃的科尔斯神庙。神庙的八角形墙壁仍然坚固，门口两侧的骑士雕像面容冷峻，守护在神庙西北面的门前。一旦进入，神庙的荒废显而易见：风吹雨打已经部分侵蚀了屋顶，导致门口之后的一部分倒塌。尽管有额外的碎石，神庙内的石凳和大型壁画大多完好无损，东南墙上的祭坛也是如此。神庙坐落在一大片已清理、平坦的土地上，本来打算用作训练场，但大自然正在重新占领，草地和野花点缀其间。",
	"There hasn't been a priest at the temple in decades, so its upkeep has waned.

	"The Cage is the most visibly imposing structure upon entering Redtower by virtue of its unique construction and namesake: a row of curved bones, much like some massive ribcage, protrude from the ground in a corridor to the tavern's southern-facing wall and side entrance. The last few ribs are incorporated into the inn's construction, acting as supporting rafters visible on the inside of the building. The rest of the Cage's construction is eclectic, with the older parts of the inn—the space immediately connected to the enormous ribcage—of the wood-and-stone construction typical of the region but with newer elements showing more distant touches: sweeping iron gables from Zobeck, a dwarven-style hearth from the Ironcrags, Perunalian motifs in the columns, and so on.": "进入（红塔）时，（笼子）是最引人注目的结构，其独特的建筑和名字使其如此。一排弯曲的骨骼，就像一些巨大的肋骨，从地面伸出，在通向酒馆南墙和侧门的走廊中。最后几根肋骨被纳入客栈的建筑中，作为内部可见的支撑横梁。笼子的其余部分建筑风格多样，客栈的旧部分——与巨大肋骨直接相连的空间——采用了当地典型的木石结构，但新元素显示出更遥远的影响：来自佐贝克的铁瓦，来自铁峰的矮人式壁炉，柱子上有佩鲁纳利亚的图案等。",
	"Considering Redtower's small size and populace, the Cage is surprisingly full-featured: it boasts several rooms from comfortable to aristocratic in quality, though it has only one aristocratic suite. Owing to its adventurous— and often wealthy—patronage, travelers can find lodgings and fare suitable for up to a wealthy lifestyle.": "考虑到红塔(Redtower)的规模小和人口稀少，笼子(The Cage)却出奇地设施齐全：它拥有从舒适到贵族质量的几个房间，尽管只有一个贵族套房。由于它的冒险性——通常是富有的客户群，旅行者可以找到适合豪华生活方式的住宿和饮食。",
	"The Cage's name—and unique construction element— supposedly dates back to the town's earliest days as Redleaf when the proprietors' ancestors, Milena and Henrik Gjorski, slew a mighty giant on the spot the inn now rests. The toll of the fight would mean the end of their adventuring career, but they returned to this site of their last great battle to retire. They found the giant withered and scavenged to little more than a massive ribcage and decided to build an inn around it, preserving it as their final—and biggest—trophy.": "这个酒馆的名字——以及独特的建筑元素——据说可以追溯到镇上早期作为红叶镇时，业主的祖先米莉娜和亨利克·格约斯基在这个酒馆现在所在地杀死了一只强大的巨人。这场战斗的代价意味着他们冒险生涯的终结，但他们回到了他们最后一次伟大战斗的地点退休。他们发现巨人已经干瘪，只剩下一副巨大的胸腔，于是决定在周围建造一座酒馆，将其保留为他们最后——也是最大的——战利品。",

The pair arrived in Redtower as boat workers, wound up overdrinking at the Cage with some adventurers, and missed their boat to leave. Deciding to put their vice to good use, the two brewed up some concoctions that won over visiting adventurers, so they took over the brewery, naming it the Sweet Sap. Not being forest folk, they insist the name was a nod to Redtower's livelihood and nothing to do with the ingredients.

	"South of Agniezka's smithy ({@area R8|SC-R8|x}), past the gate over the southeast road, a squat stone tower sits on a little hillock where it connects to the town's timber palisade. It is a defensive fortification but also the town's namesake: the stones of the tower are somewhat faded but still a deep crimson.

Theories and rumors about it abound, however, and can be heard on the {@table Gossip Table|KPSC}.": "在阿格涅兹卡铁匠铺({@area R8|SC-R8|x})以南，穿过东南路上的大门，一个矮胖的石塔坐落在一个小土丘上，与城镇的木栅栏相连。这是一个防御设施，也是城镇的名字来源：塔的石头有些褪色，但仍然是深红色的。即使是在笼子里的阿里亚德娜和安布罗齐也不知道这座塔是如何建造的。然而，关于它的理论和传言却层出不穷，并可以在{@table Gossip Table|KPSC}上听到。",
	"The temple of the Gear Goddess is an odd, circular building in the southeast of town. Eight double windows protrude at even spaces around the temple, and its center is a small clearing, giving it a cog-like appearance from above. The building itself is a blend of wood and stone construction that, unlike the temple of Khors, has been well maintained. Reaching the temple of Rava from the road requires wading through a collection of the Spinner's \"sacred\" scrap: broken things, metal bits, and discarded items are given places of honor here.": "齿轮女神殿是镇上东南部一个奇特的圆形建筑。庙宇周围有八扇双层窗户，均匀分布，中心是一个小空地，从上方看起来像一个齿轮。建筑本身是木石结构的混合体，与Khors神殿不同，这座庙宇一直保持得很好。从道路到达Rava神殿需要穿过一堆Spinner的“神圣”废料：破碎的物品、金属碎片和被丢弃的物品在这里被赋予了尊贵的地位。",
	"The interior of the temple opens into a large chamber that circles to the left and right.

His last assignment came from a group of noble thrill seekers from Cronepisht, looking to conquer the Scarlet Citadel; some sinister trap unleashed waves of undead on them before they made it far, and Konrad barely escaped with his own life—and what treasures they'd found before the end. He chose a long life against an adventurous one and settled in Redtower, pursuing the entrepreneurial opportunity he saw in appealing to an adventurer's greed for power.": "{@creature Konrad of Runkelstad|KPSC} 住在这里，是一位退休的战斗法师，他在为王国效力和作为一名自由佣兵（人类 {@creature mage|MM}）时赚了一大笔财富。他的最后一次任务是来自克罗尼皮斯特的一群贵族冒险家，他们想征服绯红城堡；在他们走得很远之前，一些邪恶的陷阱释放了大批不死生物，康拉德勉强逃脱，并带着他们在灾难结束前找到的宝藏。他选择了长寿而不是冒险生活，并在红塔镇定居，追求他看到的满足冒险者对权力贪婪的创业机会。",

	"Eva doesn't hesitate to welcome the party inside and treats them with ciders, apple pies, and nosy questions.

The looming presence of the citadel itself can't be ignored as Gellert's henchmen and experiments do not always stay contained.": "尽管红塔（Redtower）在白色森林（White Forest）边境开辟了一个相对安全的地盘，但即使没有城堡，这个地区也是相当危险的。这里的植物和动物受到魔法和{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}的影响而发生了变化，这里可能隐藏着一些更好不去探索的神秘。城堡本身的悬而未决的存在也不容忽视，因为盖勒特（Gellert）的手下和实验并不总是受到控制。",

	"A small hut cobbled together from loose stone and reclaimed wood perches on the opposite side of the riverbank northeast of Redtower. The hut looks like it has been knocked down and rebuilt multiple times, evidenced by the scattering of half-buried debris around it. On the south side of the hut is a large, gnarled tree with a sturdy, covered platform nestled in its branches. It is of much better construction than the hut below.": "在红塔东北的对岸，有一座用松散的石头和回收木材拼凑而成的小棚屋。这座小屋看起来像是被拆除并多次重建过，周围散落着半埋的碎片，证明了这一点。在小屋的南侧是一棵古老的、多瘤的大树，树枝上有一个坚固的、有顶的平台。这个平台的建造质量比下面的小屋要好得多。",
	"This is the home of Tobiasz, an elderly human {@creature commoner|MM} hermit who once lived in Redtower but grew horrified by the complicity of the townsfolk in letting adventurers run to their slaughter in the Scarlet Citadel. He takes it upon himself now to warn people away, which is why he hasn't left yet; he goes into Redtower only for supplies and to shame the townsfolk. Otherwise, he spends his time writing letters to Queen Dorytta to bring an army to raze the citadel once and for all. Tobiasz's trade is carpentry, and he built both the hut and tree stand, which is where he flees to when monsters inevitably attack. The hut, on the other hand, has been ransacked so much he only bothers with \"good enough.\"": "这是托比亚斯(Tobiasz)的家，一个年迈的人类{@creature commoner|MM}隐士，曾经住在红塔，但对镇民在斯卡雷特城堡让冒险者去送死的勾结感到震惊。他现在自己承担起警告他人的责任，这也是他为什么还没离开的原因；他只进红塔买些必需品并羞辱镇民。除此之外，他的时间都花在给多丽塔女王写信，希望她带领军队彻底摧毁城堡。托比亚斯的手艺是木工，他建造了小屋和树台，当怪物袭击时，他会逃到树台上。小屋则经常被洗劫，他只顾“勉强够用”了。",

	"Set in a small clearing in the woods southwest of Redtower is an airy temple to the Twin Gods, Yarila and Porevit, Mother Field and Father Harvest. The temple itself is a roomy structure with few walls and has archways instead of doors. The roof supports come from wooden posts wrapped in ivy and vines, most of them in perpetual bloom. An altar to the Twin Gods is set before the temple structure, an elevated stone block skirted by flowers and bountiful fruits and vegetables. In a rectangular periphery around the altar is a \"fence\" of stakes in the ground, marking growth stands of tomatoes, berries, grapes, and other seasonal crops.": "位于雷德塔西南的树林中的一个小空地上，是一座供奉双神雅里拉(Yarila)和波列维特(Porevit)的通风庙宇，分别代表着母亲田野和父亲丰收。这座庙宇本身是一个宽敞的建筑，几乎没有墙壁，而是用拱门代替门。屋顶的支撑来自缠绕着常年开花的常春藤和藤蔓的木柱。庙宇前设有一个供奉双神的祭坛，一个高耸的石块，周围围绕着鲜花和丰盛的水果蔬菜。在祭坛周围的矩形边缘上，是一圈插在地上的桩子，标志着番茄、浆果、葡萄和其他季节作物的生长区。",

	"The focal point of the clearing is a weather-worn stone arch, lopsided and half-sunk into the ground, its engravings faded with the passing of eras. A withered black vine winds around both sides of the arch, never blooming but also never crumbling. The vines are unyielding and cold as iron when touched, and the stone itself imparts such a frigid sensation that, even in the hottest summers, the chill on the skin lingers for hours.": "这片空地的焦点是一个风化的石拱门，歪斜地半埋在地里，上面的雕刻随着岁月的流逝而褪色。一根干枯的黑藤蔓缠绕在拱门的两侧，从不开花也从不崩塌。当触摸到这些藤蔓时，它们坚韧而冰冷如铁，而石头本身则传递出一种刺骨的感觉，即使在炎炎夏日，皮肤上的寒意仍然持续数小时。",
	"The arch once led to a shadow road that fed into the greater White Road nearby. At some point, the connection collapsed, and the arch went dormant. Recently, however, the archway has been showing signs of life, prompting interest from others in the region.": "这个拱门曾经通向一条影子之路，它汇入附近更大的白色之路。在某个时候，这个连接崩溃了，拱门变得沉寂。然而最近，这个拱门开始显示生机的迹象，引起了该地区其他人的兴趣。",

	"No path leads to Zula's cottage in the woods near the northwestern road into Redtower. The party might stumble into her cottage clearing or perhaps notice the trail of hearth smoke above the trees.

	"The door is ajar just enough for an unarmored Small creature to slip through if it makes a successful {@dc 12} Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. Otherwise the door moves and squeaks loudly unless the hinges are oiled beforehand— which is difficult to do because the hinges are on the opposite side of the door. If a Small character slips through and oils the hinges, the rest of the party can get through quietly.

	"The largest, nastiest-looking hook hangs motionless above a five-foot hole in the floor that drops into blackness. Something is lashed to the hook—a pair of lacerated human hands, gnawed off at the wrists. The chain extends through a pulley attached to the ceiling and back down to a winch with hundreds of feet of chain spooled around it.": "一根最大、看起来最恶心的钩子悬挂在地板上一个五英尺深的洞口上方，洞口通向黑暗。有什么东西被绑在钩子上——一对被撕裂的人类手，被咬断在手腕处。链条穿过连接在天花板上的滑轮，再回到一个绕着数百英尺链条的绞盘上。",
	"When a body needs to be disposed of—usually a dead body, but not always—{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} ties it to the hook at the end of the chain and has {@creature Scar|KPSC} lower it through the hole in the floor.

Before the corpses animate into {@creature zombie|MM|zombies}, they're just corpses, and damage dealt to them has no effect.

	"The zombies can be wherever in the chamber you want them, but they should be spread around. If a zombie can attack a creature while hanging from its chain, it does. Otherwise, zombies must spend 5 feet of movement dropping off the chain before approaching their targets.": "僵尸可以在房间里任何地方，但它们应该分散开来。如果一个僵尸可以在悬挂在链条上的情况下攻击生物，它会这样做。否则，僵尸必须花费5英尺的移动来从链条上掉下来，然后接近它们的目标。",

	"The chest contains {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}'s most precious belongings: trophies of his victims.

	"{@creature Ushulx|KPSC} is a blood cultist who venerates Charun in the domain of death.

When the citadel was built, the entrance to the catacombs was outside the walls. This was the first chamber of the catacombs. It served various ritual purposes during interment ceremonies. When the citadel was besieged, the defenders caved in this section of the catacombs to prevent the attackers from gaining entrance this way or from collapsing the catacombs to undermine the walls.": "这些地下墓穴比血色城堡要古老。它们的历史可以追溯到这里曾经是霍尔赞格狩猎小屋（由几座独立建筑组成）的所在地。当城堡建成时，地下墓穴的入口位于城墙外。这是地下墓穴的第一个房间。在葬礼仪式期间，它被用于各种仪式用途。当城堡被围困时，为了阻止攻击者从这里进入或者倒塌地下墓穴以破坏城墙，守卫者将这一部分地下墓穴封闭了起来。",

	"Three large, metal vats dominate the center of this huge room. The vats emit burps of gas and splashes of foul-smelling, thick liquid. Slime drips or squirts from cracked hoses patched with rags and resin. Occasionally, a shudder runs through the whole assembly.": "这个巨大房间的中心有三个大金属大缸。这些大缸时不时冒出气泡和恶臭、浓稠液体的飞溅。从用破布和树脂修补的破裂软管上滴下或喷出黏液。偶尔，整个装置会发生一阵颤动。",
	"Work tables around the vats are covered with beakers, vials, burners, bowls of powder, bottles of liquid, grinders, forceps, heavy gloves, jars of ink, quills, and paper. Imp-like creatures of elemental composition flit across the tables, sending papers flying and knocking over glass beakers that shatter on the stone floor.": "在酒桶周围的工作台上摆满了烧杯、小瓶、燃烧器、粉末碗、液体瓶、研磨机、镊子、厚手套、墨水瓶、羽毛笔和纸张。元素构成的小恶魔在桌子上飞来飞去，让纸张飘起来，打翻玻璃烧杯，碎裂在石地板上。",
	"A nook in the south wall serves as a reading area with a chair, a lamp stand, and shelved books and scrolls. A similar nook in the north wall is occupied by simple living arrangements: a bed, a chest, and a cooking grate piled with dishes.": "南墙的一个角落作为阅读区，有一把椅子、一盏灯架和放置书籍和卷轴的架子。北墙的一个类似角落被简单的生活用具占据着：一张床、一个箱子和堆满碟子的烹饪架。",
	"If you decide to place Maksilov here, be sure to read her entry in the {@adventure appendix|KPSC|10} and the notes for {@area Area 206|SC-206|x} in order to understand her motivation and state of mind. She doesn't immediately attack characters who intrude on her work, but she is highly suspicious of anyone who shows knowledgeable interest in it; they might be plotting to steal her accomplishments. Wherever Maksilov is, the {@creature quasit|MM} {@creature Bastronombecqua|KPSC|Bastron} is always nearby.": "如果你决定把Maksilov放在这里，请务必阅读她在{@adventure appendix|KPSC|10}中的条目以及{@area Area 206|SC-206|x}的注释，以了解她的动机和心态。她不会立即攻击闯入她工作区域的角色，但对于展现出对此有知识性兴趣的人却持高度怀疑；他们可能正在策划窃取她的成就。无论Maksilov身在何处，{@creature quasit|MM} {@creature Bastronombecqua|KPSC|Bastron}总是附近。",
	"Maksilov already created one {@creature dire gelatinous cube|KPSC} in these vats. She's now trying (for the twenty-second time) to incubate a {@creature gelatinous cube|MM}/{@creature ochre jelly|MM} {@creature Gelatinous Cube/Ochre Jelly Hybrid|KPSC|hybrid}—and this attempt is about to pay off, more or less.": "Maksilov已经在这些大缸中创建了一个{@creature dire gelatinous cube|KPSC}。她现在正在尝试（第二十二次）孵化一个{@creature gelatinous cube|MM}/{@creature ochre jelly|MM}{@creature Gelatinous Cube/Ochre Jelly Hybrid|KPSC|hybrid}，这次尝试即将成功，或多或少。",
	"When characters arrive, the {@creature gelatinous cube/ochre jelly hybrid|KPSC} is about to burst from the tank. Not even Maksilov is prepared for this or knows what to expect.": "当角色们到达时，{@creature gelatinous cube/ochre jelly hybrid|KPSC} 就要从水箱里爆发出来了。就连Maksilov也没有准备好，也不知道会发生什么。",
	"If Maksilov is present, she's distracted by the unexpected forces at work in the vats and dismissive of the intruders to the point of being rude. If characters attack her, make threats, or seem overtly dangerous, she loses her {@status concentration} and mistakenly opens a valve on one of the tanks, which triggers the burst.": "如果(Maksilov)出现，她会被罐子里意想不到的力量分散注意力，并对入侵者不屑一顾，甚至变得粗鲁。如果角色攻击她、发出威胁或显得明显危险，她会失去她的{@status concentration}，错误地打开其中一个罐子的阀门，引发爆炸。",
	"If a character interacts with the apparatus and fails a {@dc 18} Intelligence saving throw, they turn, twist, or disrupt something they should have left alone and the vats erupt.": "如果一个角色与装置互动并未通过{@dc 18}智力豁免检定，他们会转身、扭曲或干扰本应该放过的东西，导致大桶爆发。",
	"If Maksilov isn't present (or the characters don't antagonize her) and no one pokes their fingers into the machinery, one of the {@variantrule ooze mephits|KPSC|mephits} triggers the burst out of pure mischievousness at an opportune moment.": "如果Maksilov不在场（或者角色们不对她进行敌对行为），也没有人把手指伸进机器里，其中一个{@variantrule ooze mephits|KPSC|mephits}会在合适的时机因纯粹调皮而触发爆发。",
	"Before the tanks burst, make sure you know where everyone is. When the vats split open and the hybrid erupts from them, ooze immediately flows across the floor in a thick wave. Place {@area the overlay|SC-202-MO|x} on the map. It shows the size of the {@creature gelatinous cube/ochre jelly hybrid|KPSC}, which is big enough to nearly fill the room to a depth of 12 to 18 inches! Every character in a space that's also occupied by the escaping hybrid must make a successful {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.": "在储罐爆裂之前，请确保你知道每个人的位置。当储罐裂开，混合怪物从中爆发出来时，粘液会立即以厚厚的浪潮流过地板。在地图上放置{@area the overlay|SC-202-MO|x}。它显示了{@creature gelatinous cube/ochre jelly hybrid|KPSC}的大小，足够大，几乎可以将房间填满，深度为12到18英寸！每个占据与逃脱的混合怪物相同空间的角色必须进行成功的{@dc 13}敏捷豁免才能避免被击倒{@condition prone}。",
	"Besides Maksilov and the hybrid, the room also contains four {@variantrule ooze mephits|KPSC}, one of each type ({@creature ooze mephit (dust)|KPSC|dust}, {@creature ooze mephit (ice)|KPSC|ice}, {@creature ooze mephit (magma)|KPSC|magma}, and {@creature ooze mephit (steam)|KPSC|steam}). They are well aware they're no match for the characters, so once chaos erupts, they spend the time laughing and jeering at the characters' plight from the library and sleeping nooks. If they see an opening to trip a character or significantly ratchet up someone's danger without getting themselves killed, they jump at the chance.": "除了Maksilov和混血人，房间里还有四个{@variantrule ooze mephits|KPSC}，每种一个({@creature ooze mephit (dust)|KPSC|dust}，{@creature ooze mephit (ice)|KPSC|ice}，{@creature ooze mephit (magma)|KPSC|magma}和{@creature ooze mephit (steam)|KPSC|steam})。他们心知自己不是角色的对手，所以一旦混乱爆发，他们会在图书馆和睡眠角落里笑着嘲笑角色的困境。如果他们看到一个机会可以绊倒一个角色或显著地增加某人的危险而不会置自己于死地，他们会抓住机会。",
	"If the hybrid erupts and a battle breaks out here, every other creature on this level hears it. Whether they come running to reinforce the fight is up to you. This is already a dangerous situation; you probably don't need to make it substantially worse just to keep things exciting. Even if reinforcements come, no one (including {@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC}) has seen a creature like the cube/ jelly hybrid before, and they're not going to wade into it just to get at the party. One potential outcome, if the battle overwhelms the characters, is that once they fall {@condition unconscious}, they're dragged out of the ooze and imprisoned. They could wake up in the cells above ({@area Area 105|SC-105|x}), bound and gagged on the landing atop the stairs to Level 3 ({@area Area 210|SC-210|x}), as captives of the trollkin (great hall, {@area Area 311|SC-311|x}), or even be passed all the way down to {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} on Level 4.": "如果混合体爆发，战斗在这里爆发，这一层的每个其他生物都会听到。他们是否前来增援战斗取决于你。这已经是一个危险的情况；你可能不需要让事情变得更糟，只是为了保持紧张刺激。即使有援军到来，没有人（包括{@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC}）见过像立方体/果冻混合体这样的生物，他们不会为了攻击队伍而冒险。如果战斗压倒了角色，一个可能的结果是，一旦他们倒下{@condition unconscious}，他们会被从软泥中拖出并被监禁。他们可能会在上面的牢房里醒来（{@area Area 105|SC-105|x}），被捆绑和堵嘴，位于通往第3层楼梯顶端的平台上（{@area Area 210|SC-210|x}），成为巨魔族（大厅，{@area Area 311|SC-311|x}）的俘虏，甚至被传送到第4层的{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}。",
	"Many potions and alchemical concoctions are spread around the work tables. Ten minutes of searching is enough to round them all up. They include: two {@item potion of ooze friendship|KPSC|potions of ooze friendship} (similar to {@item potion of animal friendship|DMG|animal friendship} but only oozes are affected), one {@item potion of diminution}, two {@item potion of gelatinous form (acidic)|KPSC|potions of gelatinous form (acidic variant}—see {@adventure the appendix|KPSC|10}), two {@item potion of greater healing|DMG|potions of greater healing}, one {@item eyedrops of see invisibility|KPSC} (as the {@spell see invisibility|PHB|spell}), one {@item dust of somnolence|KPSC} (as a 1st-level {@spell sleep} spell), and one {@item life-preserving salve|KPSC} (stabilizes a dying creature when smeared onto the creature's forehead; vial contains five doses). There's also one {@item experimental potion of invulnerability|KPSC}. The potion has the standard effect in addition to the following side effect: for the next hour after drinking it, the creature can regain hit points only by drinking {@item potion of healing (*)|DMG|potions of healing}, not through magic or resting or any other means. This effect can't be discovered until healing is tried and fails.": "许多药水和炼金药剂散落在工作台周围。搜索十分钟足以将它们全部找到。它们包括：两个{@item potion of ooze friendship|KPSC|potions of ooze friendship}（类似于{@item potion of animal friendship|DMG|animal friendship}，但只影响软泥怪），一个{@item potion of diminution}，两个{@item potion of gelatinous form (acidic)|KPSC|potions of gelatinous form (acidic variant}—见{@adventure the appendix|KPSC|10})，两个{@item potion of greater healing|DMG|potions of greater healing}，一个{@item eyedrops of see invisibility|KPSC}（作为{@spell see invisibility|PHB|spell}），一个{@item dust of somnolence|KPSC}（作为1级{@spell sleep}法术），以及一个{@item life-preserving salve|KPSC}（在涂抹到垂死生物的额头时稳定垂死生物；小瓶中含有五剂）。还有一个{@item experimental potion of invulnerability|KPSC}。这个药水除了标准效果外，还有以下副作用：在喝下药水后的接下来一个小时内，生物只能通过喝{@item potion of healing (*)|DMG|potions of healing}来恢复生命值，不能通过魔法、休息或其他方式。这个效果直到尝试治疗失败后才能被发现。",
	"The library nook contains most of Maksilov's reference material and her extensive notes, written in her unique cypher combining mathematical and alchemical symbols. Someone who studies this material for several months can learn a great deal from it; she's a gifted and accomplished alchemist. Her work would be impossible to reproduce, however, without the ooze incubators from this chamber, the ooze essence extractor ({@area Area 207|SC-207|x}), and the vital alchemist's furnace ({@area Area 206|SC-206|x}). The extractor and the vats are described in enough detail to be recreated from her notes, but the alchemist's furnace has been here for ages and Maksilov herself doesn't fully understand how or why it works. All the books, scrolls, and notes in this small library plus stray notes and books scattered across the work tables (about 220 pounds' worth of material) would fetch at least 1,000 gp from an alchemists' or wizards' college or from an ambitious practitioner of alchemy.": "图书馆角落里摆放着大部分Maksilov的参考资料和她的大量笔记，用她独特的密码书写，结合了数学和炼金符号。花几个月时间研究这些材料的人可以从中学到很多东西；她是一位有天赋且成就卓著的炼金术士。然而，如果没有这个房间里的软泥孵化器、软泥精华萃取器({@area Area 207|SC-207|x})和重要的炼金术士熔炉({@area Area 206|SC-206|x})，她的工作将无法复制。萃取器和大桶的描述足以从她的笔记中重现，但炼金术士熔炉已经存在很久，Maksilov本人也并不完全了解它是如何或为什么会运作。这个小图书馆里的所有书籍、卷轴和笔记，加上散落在工作桌上的杂乱笔记和书籍（约220磅的材料），可以从炼金术士或巫师学院，或者雄心勃勃的炼金术实践者那里至少卖出1,000金币。",
	"The sleeping nook contains nothing of special interest: a cot with a broken and badly repaired leg, an unlocked chest containing a few changes of clothing for Maksilov, and a stove for cooking. She relies on a {@creature steam mephit|MM} to clean her dishes, and it's clear from the pile that it's been slacking off.": "睡觉的角落里没有什么特别有趣的东西：一张有一条破损和糟糕修复的腿的小床，一个未锁的箱子里装着几套Maksilov的衣服，还有一个用来烹饪的火炉。她依靠{@creature steam mephit|MM}来清洗她的碟子，从堆积的碟子看来，这个{@creature steam mephit|MM}似乎有点懒散。",
	"This area and the smaller one across the hallway are used for mundane storage of food (preserved meat and fish, root vegetables, hard bread, etc.), water, wine, and other unremarkable supplies. The only other thing here is a {@creature suppurating ooze|CCodex} (Creature Codex) that got into a barrel of meat that's gone slightly off. It looks as if blood or other meat juice leaked out of one barrel and formed a small puddle on the floor. If no one pokes at the puddle or sorts through the barrel, the ooze remains quiet and still. If someone interacts with it, it attacks with surprise unless characters indicate they expect the puddle to flash into motion.": "这个区域和走廊对面的小区域用于存放食物（保存的肉类和鱼类、根茎类蔬菜、硬面包等）、水、葡萄酒和其他普通的物资。这里唯一的其他东西是一个{@creature suppurating ooze|CCodex}（生物图鉴）, 它钻进了一个已经变质的肉桶里。似乎有血液或其他肉汁从一个桶里渗出来，在地板上形成了一个小水洼。如果没有人去戳这个水洼或者整理桶子，这团软泥会保持安静和静止。如果有人与之互动，除非角色们表明他们预料到水洼会突然动起来，否则它会出其不意地发动攻击。",
	"A secret door on the south wall opens into a small, hidden room. A successful {@dc 13} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check reveals the door and the latch to open it. A {@skill Perception} check indicates only that a door may exist; finding it takes 10 minutes of moving crates, tapping on the wall, and poking between stones with a knife blade.": "南墙上的一个秘密门通往一个小小的隐藏房间。成功的{@dc 13}智力检定({@skill Investigation})会揭示门的存在以及打开它的方法。进行{@skill Perception}检定只会暗示可能存在一扇门；要找到它需要花费10分钟移动箱子、敲击墙壁，并用刀片在石头之间探索。",
	"When the door is opened, place the appropriate {@area overlay|SC-203-MO|x} on the map.": "当门打开时，在地图上放置适当的{@area overlay|SC-203-MO|x}。",

	"Also here but unseen by the characters is a {@creature gelatinous cube|MM} that completely fills the chamber. That's why Maksilov considers this area secure, not because of the secret door.

	"There are no completed potions here. Instead, these are rare and expensive potion components. All together, they weigh 40 pounds and are worth 2,600 gp to an alchemist. If sold to a normal merchant, they fetch only a quarter of that.": "这里没有成品药水。相反，这些是稀有且昂贵的药水成分。总共重40磅，对炼金术士价值2600 gp。如果卖给普通商人，它们只能卖出四分之一的价格。",
	"The secret door into this portion of the level is well hidden, and the leader of the dust goblins (firstblade Keluikinj) enforces strict discipline on the other members of his band to keep it that way. He suspects (rightly) that if their presence were discovered, they'd be in mortal danger from Maksilov's oozes or {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}'s magic.": "这一部分级别的秘密门隐藏得很好，尘土哥布林的首领（firstblade Keluikinj）对他的手下施加严格纪律，以保持秘密。他怀疑（正确地）如果他们的存在被发现，他们将面临来自Maksilov的软泥怪或{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}的魔法的致命危险。",
	"The door can't be noticed haphazardly or in passing. Only a dedicated search along the south wall of the corridor in {@area Area 203|SC-203|x} and a successful {@dc 15} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check reveals it.": "门不能随意或匆匆忽视。只有在{@area Area 203|SC-203|x}走廊南墙上进行专注搜索，并成功进行{@dc 15}智力检定({@skill Investigation})后才能发现它。",
	"The dust goblins stay quiet in their lair to avoid being heard by the level's other residents. Hearing anything beyond the secret door requires a successful {@dc 20} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. If the result is 17 or higher, the creature picks up the smells of whatever's on the other side of the door. The goblins have been in this sealed-up lair for a few weeks, and it's getting awfully foul inside. Dust goblins aren't especially perceptive, but one of them is always assigned to listen for movement in the hallway. If there's been a fight anywhere on the level in the last hour, the goblins are on alert. The same applies if characters searching for the door don't keep quiet. The dust goblins can be surprised only if they aren't on alert and either the creature opening the secret door makes a successful {@dc 13} Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check or characters burst through the door in a rush.": "灰尘地精在他们的巢穴里保持安静，以避免被本层其他居民听到。要听到秘密门外的任何声音，需要成功进行一次{@dc 20}感知({@skill Perception})检定。如果结果为17或更高，生物会嗅到门另一侧的气味。这些地精已经在这个封闭的巢穴里待了几个星期，里面变得相当恶臭。灰尘地精并不特别敏锐，但其中一个总是被指派听着走廊上的动静。如果在过去一小时内本层的任何地方发生了战斗，地精们就会保持警惕。如果搜寻门的角色没有保持安静，情况也是如此。灰尘地精只有在没有保持警惕的情况下才会感到惊讶，而且要么打开秘密门的生物成功进行一次{@dc 13}敏捷({@skill Stealth})检定，要么角色们冲破门而入。",
	"Inside the lair are six {@creature dust goblin|ToB|dust goblins} (Tome of Beasts) led by {@creature firstblade Keluikinj|KPSC} (see the appendix). Unless characters achieved surprise, the dust goblins make their initiative check with advantage to represent their preparations.": "在巢穴内有六本《野兽之书》{@creature dust goblin|ToB|dust goblins}，由{@creature firstblade Keluikinj|KPSC}领导（见附录）。除非角色们取得了先发制人的优势，否则尘土哥布林将以优势进行他们的先攻检定，以代表他们的准备工作。",
	"Five feet inside the doorway, the dust goblins have erected a barrier from stones, crates (filled with rocks), and planks. This barricade extends nearly to the ceiling; it's far too tall for the short dust goblins to use as a fighting bastion, but it forces invaders to enter along a narrow path. The barricade is tremendously heavy, but it can be toppled over with a successful {@dc 20} Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.": "在门口五英尺处，尘土地精用石头、装满岩石的板条箱筑起了一道屏障。这道 barricade 延伸到了几乎接近天花板；对于身材矮小的尘土地精来说，这个屏障太高了，无法用作防御堡垒，但它迫使入侵者只能沿着狭窄的路径进入。这个 barricade 非常沉重，但可以通过成功的 {@dc 20} 力量 ({@skill Athletics}) 检定来推倒。",
	"Embedded in the barricade are four {@item light crossbow|PHB|light crossbows} pointed toward the entrance. Dust goblins can trigger these crossbows with lanyards from anywhere in the room. They do so as characters come through the door. Each crossbow has {@hit 4} to hit, and a hit deals 3 ({@damage 1d6}) piercing damage plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) poison damage; a successful {@dc 11} Constitution saving throw against poison halves the poison damage.": "镶嵌在路障中的是四个{@item light crossbow|PHB|light crossbows}指向入口的弩弓。尘土哥布林可以通过房间中的绳套触发这些弩弓。他们会在角色通过门时这样做。每个弩弓有{@hit 4}命中，一次命中造成3({@damage 1d6})穿刺伤害加上9({@damage 2d8})毒素伤害；成功的{@dc 11}体质豁免可以减半毒素伤害。",
	"If the dust goblins are surprised, they don't have a chance to trigger the crossbow traps, and you should arrange them around the room however you like. Assuming they're not surprised, three stand near the east wall holding the lanyards and with crossbows ready to shoot; the other three plus Keluikinj are in {@area Area 205|SC-205|x}, sheltered behind the debris and also ready to shoot.": "如果尘土地精感到惊讶，它们就没有机会触发弩箭陷阱，你可以自行安排它们在房间里的位置。假设它们没有感到惊讶，三个站在东墙附近，手持绳索并准备射击弩箭；另外三个和凯鲁金吉在{@area Area 205|SC-205|x}，躲在碎石后面，也准备射击。",
	"The passage between {@area Areas 204|SC-204|x} and {@area 205|SC-205|x} is heaped with debris, and the heap is purposefully unstable. To make a melee attack across the heap, a creature must have reach of 10 feet. Otherwise, the creature must climb atop the debris. The heap is considered {@quickref difficult terrain||3}, but other than that, climbing up is automatic. Before a creature on the heap can make a melee attack, it must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw.

	"The dust goblins are accustomed to keeping silent, and that extends even to fighting in this place. They make little noise during the battle and communicate with gestures, grunts, and breathy whistles.": "尘埃地精习惯保持沉默，甚至在这个地方战斗时也是如此。他们在战斗中几乎不发出任何声音，通过手势、咕哝声和呼哧声进行交流。",
	"If the result is equal to or less than the number of dust goblins still alive, the survivors ask for a truce. (The more there are, the more likely they are to want to survive this.) If characters are at least willing to hear them out, they explain Keluikinj was a bad leader who wouldn't let them kill and steal. Why are they here, if not to bloody their weapons and fill their loot bags? They're glad he's dead, and they'll leave this place and never come back if the characters let them. The dust goblins know the layout of the level and can describe in vague terms what's to be found where, although most of it is worthless leavings of civilization that they neither understand nor want. They might agree to act as guides if they're promised plenty of gold, but trusting them would be a dangerous mistake.": "如果结果等于或小于尚存活的尘鬼数量，幸存者会请求停战。(%num%)（数量越多，他们越想活下去。）如果角色至少愿意听他们说，他们会解释凯鲁金吉（Keluikinj）是个坏领袖，不让他们杀人抢劫。如果不是为了让他们的武器染血、填满战利品袋，他们为何会在这里？他们很高兴他死了，如果角色们放过他们，他们会离开这里，永不返回。尘鬼们了解这一层的布局，并能模糊描述各处的情况，尽管其中大部分是他们既不理解也不想要的文明遗留物。如果承诺给他们足够的黄金，他们可能同意担任向导，但相信他们将是一个危险的错误。",
	"Keluikinj forbade the dust goblins from stealing anything on their surreptitious scouting patrols through the level to keep the inhabitants from getting suspicious, but that didn't stop them entirely.

Maksilov won't explain it—she has no time to waste on random intruders.": "如果角色与她交谈（她对奥术角色非常怀疑，不容忍任何人干扰她的工作），她谨慎地解释说她正在努力完善一种用于{@i prima materia}的配方。 一个有炼金术背景的角色知道那是什么（一切事物起源的原始物质）； 一个接受过{@skill Arcana}训练的角色可以尝试进行{@dc 20}智力({@skill Arcana})检定来认出它。 马克西洛夫不会解释——她没有时间浪费在随机闯入者身上。",
	"If characters leave Maksilov completely alone, she does the same for them. If, however, they pester her with questions, poke into the tools, notes, retorts, and reagents stocked around the room, or touch the furnace—especially if they touch the furnace, whose settings are exceedingly delicate and precise—she snaps and the fight is on.": "如果角色完全不打扰(Maksilov)，她也会对他们保持一样的态度。然而，如果他们纠缠她问问题，乱动工具、笔记、烧瓶和实验室里摆放的试剂，或者触碰熔炉——尤其是触碰熔炉，因为它的设置非常精密和细致——她会发火，然后就会发生争斗。",
	"{@creature Bastronombecqua|KPSC|Bastron} is a standard quasit, but Maksilov provided it with a unique potion that combines the effects of {@item Potion of Heroism|DMG|heroism} and {@item Potion of Hill Giant Strength|DMG|hill giant strength}. {@creature Bastronombecqua|KPSC|Bastron} keeps the small potion vial on a string around its neck. When it looks like a fight is about to break out (but ideally before initiative is rolled), {@creature Bastronombecqua|KPSC|Bastron} drinks the potion. It doesn't need to hoard this potion because Maksilov can always make another, and she'd rather have {@creature Bastronombecqua|KPSC|Bastron} use it to protect her than keep it corked.": "{@creature Bastronombecqua|KPSC|Bastron}是一只标准的小恶魔(quasit)，但Maksilov给它提供了一种独特的药水，结合了{@item Potion of Heroism|DMG|heroism}和{@item Potion of Hill Giant Strength|DMG|hill giant strength}的效果。{@creature Bastronombecqua|KPSC|Bastron}将小瓶药水挂在脖子上的绳子上。当看起来即将爆发战斗时（但最好是在开始战斗之前），{@creature Bastronombecqua|KPSC|Bastron}会喝下这瓶药水。它不需要囤积这瓶药水，因为Maksilov随时可以再制作一瓶，她宁愿让{@creature Bastronombecqua|KPSC|Bastron}用来保护她，也不愿让它闷在瓶子里。",
	"The mephits in this chamber are braver than most. They and {@creature Bastronombecqua|KPSC|Bastron} do their best to keep characters away from Maksilov during a fight. The vaulted ceiling is 30 feet high, so Maksilov can avoid melee if she drinks her {@item potion of flying}.": "这个房间里的小恶魔比大多数都更勇敢。它们和{@creature Bastronombecqua|KPSC|Bastron}尽力在战斗中让角色远离Maksilov。拱形天花板有30英尺高，所以如果Maksilov喝了她的{@item potion of flying}，她可以避开近战。",

Be quick; if players sense your answers are made up or random, they'll lose interest. All of it is meaningless; the furnace is far beyond their ability to comprehend at a glance. Maksilov has been working with it for years and barely understands it.": "如果有人开始旋转把手或拉动杠杆，灾难是可能的。如果玩家询问他们的角色是否可以进行任何形式的能力或技能检定来理解熔炉的控制，允许。这适用于战斗之前、期间或之后。无论结果如何，从{@table Alchemical Nonsense|KPSC}表中选择两到三个术语，以一种合理的组合向玩家提供这些信息，并尽可能认真地表达（比如，“啊，你已经识别出了磁反馈阻尼器”）。要快速；如果玩家感觉到你的回答是凭空捏造或随机的，他们会失去兴趣。所有这些都是毫无意义的；这个熔炉远远超出了他们一瞥就能理解的能力。Maksilov已经与它一起工作多年，却几乎不理解它。",

	"The alchemist's furnace itself is by far the most valuable thing here, assuming it survives. It's impossible to move, no reputable or good-aligned alchemist would come here unless the whole dungeon were cleared out, and it would take years of study and testing before characters could make any use of it. Note to yourself whether characters do anything about the furnace at the end of the adventure; if they just walk away, eventually another psychopath takes over and resumes Maksilov's work.": "炼金术士的熔炉本身是这里迄今为止最有价值的东西，假设它能幸存下来。它无法移动，除非整个地牢被清理干净，否则没有任何有声望或善良的炼金术士会来这里，而且角色们要想利用它还需要数年的研究和测试。在冒险结束时，请注意角色们是否对这个熔炉采取任何行动；如果他们只是走开，最终会有另一个精神病患者接管并继续马克西洛夫的工作。",
	"This chamber is where Maksilov extracts the essential ooziness from oozes—their precious bodily fluids—to create ooze plasma.": "这个房间是Maksilov从软泥怪身上提取精华黏液的地方——也就是它们宝贵的体液——用来制造粘液等离子体。",
	"Three huge vats stand along the south wall of this chamber. Although the vats appear to be sealed and covered by clear crystal lids, the air is acrid. Your nostrils sting, your eyes water, and you want to cough. The vats are linked by a complex web of hoses and tubes that gurgle and pulse as foul-looking bubbles and smears of slime trickle through them. The equipment makes this room resemble a distillery—a poisonous, rusted, cruft-encrusted distillery. A desk is pushed against the north wall between two doors. Writing implements are neatly arranged on it.": "这个房间的南墙上有三个巨大的大缸。尽管这些大缸看起来是密封的，并且被透明的水晶盖子覆盖着，但空气中有一股刺鼻的气味。你的鼻孔灼痛，眼睛泪流满面，你感觉想咳嗽。这些大缸通过一套复杂的软管和管道相连，里面冒出恶臭的气泡和一丝丝黏液。这些设备让这个房间看起来像一个蒸馏厂——一个有毒的、生锈的、长满污垢的蒸馏厂。一张桌子被推到了北墙之间的两扇门之间。写具整齐地摆放在上面。",
	"A character who spends at least 10 minutes inspecting the vats and makes a successful {@dc 15} Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check understands the vats' purpose—to extract the essence (whatever that is) from oozes—in general terms. A character who's proficient in both {@skill Arcana} and {@skill Investigation} can double their proficiency bonus on this check; one with a background in alchemy makes the check with advantage. A character who is proficient in neither {@skill Arcana} nor {@skill Investigation} makes the check with disadvantage (this is a perfect time for you to roll the second die in secret, as discussed in the {@adventure Traps and Secret Doors|KPSC|1|Traps and Secret Doors} section). The extractor is a dodgy piece of equipment, however, and poking into it without knowing what you're doing is risky. If the result of this check is 8 or lower, the character inadvertently releases a dangerous amount of ooze plasma into the room. Everyone in the room takes 9 ({@damage 2d8}) acid damage, or half damage with a successful {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw. Anyone who fails the saving throw is {@condition incapacitated} by coughing while they remain in the room. The ooze plasma settles out of the air in about 5 minutes, at which time creatures can safely return.": "一个角色花费至少10分钟检查这些大缸，并成功进行了 {@dc 15} 智力 ({@skill Arcana}) 检定，就能大致了解这些大缸的用途——从软泥怪中提取精华—。精通 {@skill Arcana} 和 {@skill Investigation} 的角色可以在这次检定中加倍他们的熟练加值；而在炼金术背景的角色可以带着优势进行检定。一个既不精通 {@skill Arcana} 也不精通 {@skill Investigation} 的角色将带着劣势进行检定（这是你秘密投掷第二个骰子的绝佳时机，正如在 {@adventure Traps and Secret Doors|KPSC|1|Traps and Secret Doors} 部分所讨论的）。然而，这个提取器是一个不靠谱的设备，没有知道自己在做什么的情况下乱戳它是很危险的。如果这次检定的结果是8或更低，角色会意外释放出危险数量的软泥浆到房间中。房间中的每个人会受到9 ({@damage 2d8}) 酸性伤害，或者在成功进行 {@dc 13} 体质豁免检定后只受到一半伤害。任何未通过豁免检定的人在留在房间时会因咳嗽而被 {@condition incapacitated}。软泥浆会在大约5分钟内从空气中沉淀下来，届时生物可以安全返回。",
	"Atop the desk are a notebook (similar to a modern lab record), several quills, and three jars of ink (blue, red, and green). The notebook on the desk is filled with columns and rows of numbers and alchemical symbols in different colors. None of it is intelligible to anyone but {@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC}. The book is an accounting record of the extractor's input and output over many generations of trial and error and eventual productive use. Someone who successfully investigated the extractor can draw this conclusion with confidence, though they can't actually \"read\" the ledger.": "桌子上放着一本笔记本（类似于现代实验记录本），几支羽毛笔，以及三罐墨水（蓝色、红色和绿色）。桌子上的笔记本上满是用不同颜色的列和行的数字和炼金符号。除了{@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC}外，没有人能理解其中的内容。这本书是提取者多代试验和错误以及最终生产性使用的投入产出记录。成功调查过提取者的人可以自信地得出这个结论，尽管他们实际上无法“阅读”这本账本。",
	"The green ink is actually an {@creature ink guardian|CCodex} ooze (Creature Codex). Its instructions don't include stopping people from leafing casually through the notebook. It attacks if anyone damages anything in the room, alters the notebook in any way, or pockets something from the desk.": "这绿色墨水实际上是一种{@creature ink guardian|CCodex}软泥怪（生物宝典）。它的说明中没有阻止人们随意翻阅笔记本。如果有人损坏房间内的任何东西，以任何方式改变笔记本，或者从书桌上拿走东西，它就会发动攻击。",
	"A drawer in the desk contains more quills, loose sheets of paper, blotting sand, and three potion vials.

	"This chamber serves as an overflow reservoir for ooze plasma that's had its essence distilled out. Two open-topped holding tanks are meant to safely store the material, but one tank has deteriorated and is leaking badly. Maksilov's {@creature dire gelatinous cube|KPSC} is drawn to the ooze-rich slurry seeping across the floor.": "这个房间作为一个溢出的储液池，其中的软泥浆已经提取出其精华。两个开口的储液罐旨在安全地存储这种材料，但其中一个罐已经破损严重并且正在严重泄漏。Maksilov的{@creature dire gelatinous cube|KPSC}被地板上渗出的富含软泥浆的混浊液体所吸引。",
	"An acrid stinging sensation in your nostrils and mouth alerts you the air ahead is laced with corrosive fumes. Two stone vats, each about seven feet tall, flank the corridor. Rusted ladders are attached to their sides, although the bolts holding them together appear badly corroded. A noxious, green, viscous fluid seeps out of one tank and covers much of the floor. A wooden desk pushed against the wall tilts oddly; its front legs, which are in the goop on the floor, are noticeably shorter than the legs closer to the wall. A chair that once sat in front of the desk lies in pieces on the floor.": "一股刺鼻的灼热感觉在你的鼻孔和嘴里蔓延开来，警示着你前方的空气中充满了腐蚀性气体。两个石质大缸，每个约七英尺高，矗立在走廊两侧。锈迹斑斑的梯子固定在它们的侧面，尽管固定它们的螺栓看起来已经严重腐蚀。一种有毒的绿色粘稠液体从一个大缸中渗出，覆盖了大部分地板。一张木桌斜靠在墙边，前腿沾在地板上的液体中，明显比靠近墙壁的腿短。曾经放在桌前的椅子散落在地板上。",
	"The tanks have open tops. Anyone who climbs one of the ladders sees more of the green fluid (ooze plasma) sloshing gently in the tank. The sloshing is caused by four {@creature Ooze Mephit (magma)|KPSC|ooze (magma) mephits} swimming through the plasma. If a character peers into the tank for more than 5 or 6 seconds, a mephit splashes a fistful of plasma at the character's face. The character must make a successful {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw or take 5 ({@damage 1d10}) acid damage and be {@condition blinded} until someone pours clean water into their eyes to flush away the caustic fluid.": "这些罐子有敞开的顶部。任何爬上梯子的人都会看到更多绿色液体（渗漏等离子体）在罐子里轻轻晃动。这种晃动是由四个{@creature Ooze Mephit (magma)|KPSC|ooze (magma) mephits}在等离子体中游动引起的。如果一个角色凝视罐子超过5或6秒，一个小恶魔会向角色的脸上泼一把等离子体。角色必须进行成功的{@dc 13}敏捷豁免才能避免受到5（{@damage 1d10}）点酸性伤害，并且会被{@condition blinded}直到有人向他们的眼睛倒入清水冲走腐蚀性液体。",
	"The ooze plasma on the floor is weakly acidic. A creature who starts its turn in a space that's mostly ooze-covered takes 2 ({@damage 1d4}) acid damage. If the creature is {@condition prone}, the damage is 4 ({@damage 1d8}). If the creature is in one of the ooze tanks, the damage is 18 ({@damage 4d8}).": "地板上的软泥浆是弱酸性的。一个生物如果在一个大部分被软泥浆覆盖的空间开始它的回合，会受到2 ({@damage 1d4}) 点酸性伤害。如果这个生物是 {@condition prone}，伤害为4 ({@damage 1d8}) 点。如果这个生物在软泥槽中，伤害为18 ({@damage 4d8}) 点。",
	"Far more dangerous than the mephits or the ooze plasma is a {@creature dire gelatinous cube|KPSC}. It's sitting in the spaces marked with the red outline, absorbing ooze plasma like a sponge. (If a different placement would allow for a more dramatic encounter in your situation, by all means, use your best judgment!) The cube is entirely {@condition invisible} to characters when they arrive, so unless they proceed cautiously, someone is likely to walk or even jump directly into it.": "比小恶魔或软泥浆更危险的是一个{@creature dire gelatinous cube|KPSC}。它坐落在用红线标记的空间中，像海绵一样吸收软泥浆。(如果在你的情况下，不同的放置方式可以让遭遇更加戏剧性，尽管用你的判断！) 当角色们到达时，这个方块对他们完全是{@condition invisible}的，所以除非他们小心前行，否则很可能有人会直接走进甚至跳进去。",
	"When the {@creature dire gelatinous cube|KPSC} first starts its turn with 28 or fewer hit points, it reflexively strikes the cracked holding tank as a bonus action. This ruptures the tank and floods the room with ooze plasma.

In addition, every creature in that area when the tank is ruptured must make a successful {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw or fall {@condition prone} as the corrosive plasma envelops their feet. The cube tries to engulf as many {@condition prone} characters as possible, and {@condition prone} characters attempt to save against the attack with disadvantage.": "当{@creature dire gelatinous cube|KPSC}的回合开始时，其生命值为28或更少时，它会作为一个奖励动作反射性地攻击破裂的储液罐。这会使储液罐破裂并将房间淹没在软泥等离子体中。从楼梯顶部到通往{@area Area 202|SC-202|x}的门的每个空间迅速变成了脚踝深的软泥等离子体，使其{@quickref difficult terrain||3}，并在它们的回合开始时，对站在其中的每个生物造成2({@damage 1d4})酸性伤害。凶猛的明胶立方体因等离子体的注入而恢复了18({@dice 4d4 + 8})生命值。此外，当储液罐破裂时，该区域内的每个生物必须进行成功的{@dc 13}敏捷豁免才能避免{@condition prone}，因为腐蚀性等离子体包裹了他们的脚。立方体会尝试吞没尽可能多的{@condition prone}角色，而{@condition prone}角色则试图带着劣势来抵御这次攻击。",
	"It's vital to remember this is probably the first time these characters have encountered a {@creature gelatinous cube}. Most players know all about gelatinous cubes and how to deal with them, but to someone who's never heard of such a thing before—like the rookie characters—an invisible, unknown effect that dissolves people should be terrifying. Never use the words \"gelatinous,\" \"cube,\" \"ooze,\" \"jelly,\" \"acid,\" or even \"object\" when describing it. Instead, mention an invisible field in the air that somehow seizes onto and discorporates whatever it touches, like some sort of slow-acting stasis or disintegration field.": "记住，这可能是这些角色第一次遇到一个{@creature gelatinous cube}。大多数玩家都很了解果冻立方体以及如何应对它们，但对于从未听说过这种东西的人——就像新手角色一样——一种能溶解人的看不见、未知效应应该是令人恐惧的。描述时永远不要使用“果冻状”、“立方体”、“软泥”、“果冻”、“酸”甚至“物体”这些词。相反，提到空气中的一个看不见的领域，以某种方式抓住并分解它接触的任何东西，就像某种缓慢作用的静止或解体领域。",
	"This being a {@creature dire gelatinous cube|KPSC}, it remains {@condition invisible} until someone uses an action and makes a successful {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to spot it. Even then, it looks like an out-of-focus disturbance in the air, not a solid object. If someone is engulfed in it, describe them as moving in slow motion, as if time itself flows differently around them, while their flesh and tissue drifts off them like smoke and disappears. If characters attack, as they inevitably will, give no indication their attacks are having any effect, because they can't see an effect on something that's {@condition invisible}. If someone touches it experimentally, describe it as offering some resistance and immediate, searing pain. The longer you keep them guessing about what they're up against, the better.": "这是一个{@creature dire gelatinous cube|KPSC}，直到有人使用一个动作并进行成功的{@dc 15}智慧({@skill Perception})检定来发现它。即使如此，它看起来像是空气中的一个模糊扰动，而不是一个实体物体。如果有人被吞没其中，描述他们移动得像慢动作，仿佛时间本身在他们周围流动得不同，而他们的肌肤和组织则像烟雾一样飘散消失。如果角色们发动攻击，他们总会这样做，不要暗示他们的攻击产生了任何效果，因为他们看不到对于一个{@condition invisible}的东西有任何效果。如果有人试探性地触碰它，描述它提供了一些阻力和即刻的灼热疼痛。你让他们对他们所面对的东西猜测得越久，就越好。",
	"Finally, just because the cube is eventually killed doesn't mean it stops being a threat. It can still block the passage (invisibly), and it's still powerfully acidic to anyone and anything attempting to climb over it or squeeze through it.": "最后，只是因为这个魔方最终被消灭了，并不意味着它不再构成威胁。它仍然可以阻挡通道（隐形地），对于任何试图爬过它或挤过它的人和物体来说，它仍然具有强大的腐蚀性。",

	"This chamber could be a typical sage's study or office if not for the rippling bolts of pink energy tearing across it from wall to wall. The bolts resemble lightning, and your hair stands on end here as if the air is statically charged. Despite the appearance of tremendous power, the unearthly display makes no sound and seems to create no other disturbance in the surrounding air. Occasionally, however, you glimpse something almost like a recognizable scene flashing past your eyes, but it's gone too quickly for you to even be sure it happened, let alone to identify what it was.": "这个房间如果不是墙壁上涌动的粉色能量闪电，可能会是一个典型的智者研究室或办公室。这些闪电类似闪电，当你在这里时，你的头发竖立起来，仿佛空气带有静电。尽管外观显示出巨大的力量，这种超自然的展示却没有声音，似乎也没有在周围空气中造成其他干扰。然而，偶尔你会瞥见几乎像是一个可识别的场景在你眼前闪过，但它消失得太快，以至于你甚至不能确定它是否发生过，更不用说识别它是什么了。",
	"The table in the northwest corner of the chamber is covered with complex instruments of {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}'s design that help him study the time stream. They allow him to measure the flow of time, its intensity, and its momentum, and even provide him with the means to scoop up raw time and capture it in a specialized container. These instruments are well beyond the characters' experience or understanding. A successful {@dc 18} Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check reveals they all bear some relationship to time, but it provides no guidance on their specific uses or any other clues beyond that basic information. Even this can be a valuable insight, however, toward concluding that the phenomenon in the room is raw, unfiltered time.": "房间西北角的桌子上摆放着{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}设计的复杂仪器，帮助他研究时间流。它们让他能够测量时间流动、其强度和动量，甚至提供了一种方式来捕捉原始时间并将其保存在专门的容器中。这些仪器远远超出了角色们的经验或理解范围。成功的{@dc 18}智力({@skill Arcana})检定揭示了它们都与时间有某种关系，但对它们具体用途或其他线索并没有提供指导。然而，即使如此，这也可能是一个有价值的洞察，有助于得出结论：房间中的现象是未经过滤的原始时间。",
	"The time stream is tremendously dangerous to unprotected creatures; it's certainly the most dangerous feature on the three upper levels of the Scarlet Citadel's dungeon. {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} is entirely immune to its risks, thanks to the {@item ring of being anchored in time|KPSC} (see {@adventure Magic Items in the appendix|KPSC|10}). A creature who steps into the time stream or even touches it must make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw. On a success, the creature immediately drops to 0 hit points and begins dying.

Its name is {@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC}, but if asked, it gives its name as Baska.": "原始的召唤阵是由精灵们在很久以前安装的，他们建造了地牢的这一部分。它是在{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}的请求下由{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}修复到可运行状态。这个阵法的功能类似于反向{@spell magic circle};它的魔法让恶魔和元素生物无法离开。{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}利用这个阵法安全地进行召唤咒语的实验。在对小型召唤术有了一些成功之后，他尝试了一些新的东西，并超出了所有人的期望。在阵法中的生物是一个{@creature barbed devil}。它的名字是{@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC}，但如果被问及，它会给出巴斯卡(Baska)这个名字。",
	"{@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC} has been trapped in the circle for sixteen days. It's a little hungry (the bowl contains raw meat, and {@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC} is waiting for it to rot a bit more before eating it), a little bored (but devils, being ageless, are accustomed to long stretches of boredom), and intensely angry. It hides its anger well behind a facade of curiosity, but it might be goaded into showing it by repeated taunts over its situation.": "{@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC}已经被困在魔法阵中十六天了。它有点饿（碗里装着生肉，{@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC}正在等待它腐烂更久一点再吃），有点无聊（但恶魔，作为永恒存在，习惯了长时间的无聊），而且极度愤怒。它将愤怒巧妙地隐藏在好奇心的伪装之后，但如果一再被嘲弄它的处境，它可能会被激怒而展现出来。",
	"{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} is unsure what to do with {@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC}. He doesn't dare release the devil, and he doesn't know how to send it away. He hit on a possible solution when he got wind the characters were carving their way through the dungeon toward the scriptorium. The gnome promised to set {@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC} free on one condition: the devil must do its best to kill the intruders.": "{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} 不确定该怎么处理 {@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC}。他不敢释放恶魔，也不知道如何将其赶走。当他得知角色们正在穿过地牢前往抄写室时，他想到了一个可能的解决方案。这个侏儒答应释放 {@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC}，但有一个条件：恶魔必须尽力杀死入侵者。",
	"Having reached an agreement with the barbed devil, {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} now awaits the right moment. He carries a bag of coarse salt in a pouch on his belt. Scattering that salt across the magic circle creates a pathway out of the circle for {@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC}. For its part, the devil made a bargain and must honor it if {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} upholds his end.": "与刺魔达成协议后，{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} 现在正在等待合适的时机。他在腰带袋里装着一袋粗盐。在魔法阵上撒下那些盐，为{@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC} 创造了一个走出魔法阵的路径。至于刺魔，它达成了一项交易，如果{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} 履行自己的承诺，它必须遵守。",
	"The exact timing of when {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} breaks the circle is up to you. He isn't overly afraid of the characters, but he doesn't underestimate them. And since he wants to be rid of {@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC} one way or another, this one solution will solve two problems. Either the barbed devil kills the intruders and then leaves, or it's destroyed in the process of weakening the intruders to the point where {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} and his other allies can deal with them.": "{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}打破圈圈的确切时机由你决定。他并不过分害怕这些角色，但也不会低估他们。而且由于他想要摆脱{@creature Lasbascilag|KPSC}，这一个解决方案将解决两个问题。要么这只带刺的恶魔杀死闯入者然后离开，要么在削弱闯入者到{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}和他的其他盟友可以处理他们的程度时被摧毁。",
	"This chamber is used for storing preserved food and casks of wine and ale. Any inspection reveals {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} has a taste for olives and anything pickled.": "这个房间用来存放保鲜食品和葡萄酒和麦酒的木桶。任何检查都会发现{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}对橄榄和任何腌制食物都情有独钟。",
	"Note {@area Area 211|SC-211|x} is 10 feet higher than this storeroom. The passage carved through the wall drops steeply downward.": "注：{@area Area 211|SC-211|x}比这个储藏室高出10英尺。穿过墙壁雕刻的通道陡然向下倾斜。",
	"{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} employs two {@creature clockwork servant|CCodex|clockwork servants} (Creature Codex) as librarians and scribes. They've undergone minor alterations to make them more suitable for their roles, but their stat blocks are identical to standard clockwork servants. Their time is equally split between this chamber and the scriptorium stacks ({@area Areas 215|SC-215|x}, {@area 216|SC-216|x}, and {@area 218|SC-218|x}). If they're here, add them to the description.": "{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}雇佣两只{@creature clockwork servant|CCodex|clockwork servants}(生物编目)作为图书馆管理员和抄写员。它们经过了轻微改造，使其更适合其角色，但其属性块与标准发条仆从完全相同。它们的时间平均分配在这个房间和抄写室的书架之间({@area Areas 215|SC-215|x}, {@area 216|SC-216|x}, 和 {@area 218|SC-218|x})。如果它们在这里，将它们添加到描述中。",
	"Two tall desks and a work table are the only furniture here. The desks are stained with ink and are covered in scrolls, paper, quills, blotters, and jars of ink. The lower portion of the work table doubles as a bookcase.": "这里只有两张高桌和一张工作桌。桌子上沾满了墨水，摆放着卷轴、纸张、羽毛笔、吸墨纸和墨水罐。工作桌的下半部分兼作书架。",
	"The clockwork servants have no instructions to fight anyone and they're not much good at it, but they fight back with their stools and fists if attacked. If a fight breaks out, or if characters poke around on the desks when no one else is here, an {@creature ink guardian|CCodex} ooze (Creature Codex) either gets knocked over or responds to the ruckus and attacks.": "这些发条仆役没有任何指令去攻击任何人，而且他们在这方面并不擅长，但如果受到攻击，他们会用凳子和拳头进行反击。如果发生斗争，或者角色在没有其他人在场时在桌子上乱摸，一个{@creature ink guardian|CCodex}软泥怪(Creature Codex)要么被打翻，要么会对骚动做出反应并发动攻击。",
	"The scribes' job is copying texts as they become available in the scriptorium. Because the scriptorium's contents reside in the distant future, {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} can't rely on having access to what he wants when he wants it. His solution is to send two other clockwork servants into the future with his {@item time construct|KPSC} to retrieve materials and bring them to the present so scribes in this chamber can make copies. The scribes work while they can, slavishly copying every aspect of an original onto a new scroll or book until it disappears back to the future. For the most part, the scribes have no understanding of what they're copying; they simply look at squiggly lines and transfer the same shapes to blank paper or parchment. They seldom manage to finish copying something before it disappears again (see {@item Time Construct|KPSC} in the appendix), so a big part of their job is keeping track of what's been logged before. When a text reappears after weeks or years, they pick up where they left off, avoiding duplication.": "抄写员的工作是在书房中抄写文本。由于书房的内容存在于遥远的未来，{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} 不能指望在他想要的时候获得所需的材料。他的解决方案是派遣另外两个发条仆役与他的{@item time construct|KPSC} 一起前往未来，检索材料并将它们带回现在，以便这个房间的抄写员可以制作副本。抄写员在能够的时候工作，奴性地将原件的每个方面复制到新的卷轴或书籍上，直到它再次消失回到未来。在大多数情况下，抄写员并不理解他们在抄写什么；他们只是看着蜿蜒的线条，将相同的形状转移到空白纸张或羊皮纸上。他们很少能在文本再次消失之前完成抄写（见附录中的{@item Time Construct|KPSC}），因此他们工作的一个重要部分是跟踪已记录的内容。当一段文本在几周或几年后重新出现时，他们会从上次停下的地方继续，避免重复。",
	"This pit of bones is the bottom of the ossuary ({@area Area 117|SC-117|x}) in the catacombs 40 feet above. It's also the entry and exit point to the Dry Lands. Undead use this accessway to travel between that realm and Midgard.": "这个骨坑是地下墓穴中的骨骼底部({@area Area 117|SC-117|x})，位于地面上方40英尺的地下墓穴中。这也是通往干旱之地的入口和出口。不死生物利用这个通道在那个领域和中加德之间旅行。",
	"What appears to be a crumbling hole in the wall between {@area Area 213|SC-213|x} and the pit was sealed by {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} with an arcane {@spell wall of fire} spell of his own devising. The wall appears as a translucent, fiery shimmer in the air. An object or creature can pass right through it, but a creature takes 22 ({@damage 5d8}) fire damage if it does so. This is enough to keep weak undead such as {@creature skeleton|MM|skeletons}, {@creature shadow|MM|shadows}, and even most {@creature specter|MM|specters} and {@creature ghoul|MM|ghouls} from wandering through the halls of the scriptorium. More powerful undead seldom come through, being drawn instead toward the crypts above.": "在{@area Area 213|SC-213|x}和坑洞之间的墙壁上出现了一个摇摇欲坠的洞，被{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}用他自己设计的奥术{@spell wall of fire}法术封住。这面墙看起来像是空气中一道半透明的火焰般的闪烁。物体或生物可以直接穿过它，但如果生物这样做，将受到22点火焰伤害({@damage 5d8})。这足以阻止像{@creature skeleton|MM|skeletons}、{@creature shadow|MM|shadows}甚至大多数{@creature specter|MM|specters}和{@creature ghoul|MM|ghouls}这样的弱不禁风的不死生物在抄写室的走廊中徘徊。更强大的不死生物很少会穿过，它们通常会被吸引到上方的墓穴。",
	"The wall is broken here, and the doorway-sized hole is filled with dense, shimmering light. Beyond the light, you see bones—heaps of them—carpeting the floor to a depth of several feet. Above the bones is a darkness made of twisting, smoky filaments. It grows and shrinks in time to no earthly rhythm.": "这面墙在这里被打破了，门洞大小的洞口充满了浓密闪烁的光芒。在光芒之后，你看到骨头——堆积如山——铺满地板，深达数英尺。在骨头上方是由扭曲、烟雾般丝线构成的黑暗。它随着没有地球节奏的时间而生长和收缩。",
	"If you like, undead can step through the pathway while characters are watching. Catching a glimpse of the party, the undead plunge through the {@spell wall of fire} and attack. Even fairly powerful undead, such as a {@creature wight}, {@creature wraith}, or {@creature vampire spawn}, won't be an overpowering threat to the characters because they'll be weakened significantly by coming through the fire. The characters may not know that unless they've already stepped or poked an arm through the wall.": "如果你愿意，不死族可以在角色们注视着的时候穿过通道。当不死族瞥见队伍时，它们穿过{@spell wall of fire}并发动攻击。即使是相当强大的不死族，比如{@creature wight}，{@creature wraith}，或{@creature vampire spawn}，也不会对角色们构成压倒性威胁，因为它们穿过火焰后会被大大削弱。除非角色们已经穿过或伸出手臂穿过墙壁，否则他们可能不会知道这一点。",
	"The ancient arcane scriptorium of the elves comprises three chambers: this one, {@area Area 216|SC-216|x}, and {@area Area 218|SC-218|x}. The elves stocked this library with all their accumulated knowledge of magic and lore. Only when the work was done did they pause to reflect and become terrified by the implications of their collection.": "精灵古老的奥术书房包括三个房间：这个，{@area Area 216|SC-216|x}，和{@area Area 218|SC-218|x}。 精灵们用他们积累的所有魔法和传说知识填满了这个图书馆。 只有当工作完成时，他们才停下来反思，并对他们收集的内容的含义感到恐惧。",
	"Scrolls and tattered books lie in heaps on tables in this enormous, ancient library. Shelves along the walls are nearly empty except for a few damaged books, torn sheets of parchment, cobwebs, and dust. The central portion of the floor is collapsed and plunges an unknown distance to who knows where.": "在这座巨大而古老的图书馆里，卷轴和破旧的书籍堆放在桌子上。沿着墙壁的书架几乎空无一物，只有几本破损的书籍、撕破的羊皮纸、蜘蛛网和灰尘。地板的中央部分坍塌了，向下延伸到不知道通往何处的深渊。",
	"The floor collapsed 80 years ago because of instabilities induced by the fluctuations of the {@item time construct|KPSC} ({@area Area 216|SC-216|x}). The ragged opening in the floor drops straight down to the center of the dwarven armory on Level 3 ({@area Area 304|SC-304|x}). The floor of the armory is 70 feet below the floor of the scriptorium, but the fall is only 60 feet because of the tall heap of rubble at the bottom. The floor is too far down for {@sense darkvision} or any lantern to illuminate from this area. A dropped object can be heard striking bottom (several times as it bounces down the rubble pile) after about 2 seconds. Players can calculate the distance from that if they know how, or they can drop or lower a light.": "80年前，由于{@item time construct|KPSC} ({@area Area 216|SC-216|x})的波动引发的不稳定性，地板坍塌了。地板上的破洞直通矮人军械库三层({@area Area 304|SC-304|x})的中心。军械库的地板比抄写室的地板低70英尺，但由于底部有高高的碎石堆，跌落的距离只有60英尺。这个地方离得太远，无法用{@sense darkvision}或任何灯笼照亮。当一个物体掉落时，大约2秒后可以听到它撞击底部（在碎石堆上反弹几次）。玩家可以根据这个来计算距离，如果他们知道如何，或者他们可以扔下或降低一个灯光。",
	"The floor near the collapse is still unstable. If a character stands within 5 feet of the edge of the hole (which would be necessary to lower a light or even just look down), roll any die; on an odd result, the crumbling edge gives way. Allow the character to make a {@dc 8} Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the character falls into the armory; on a success, the character manages to jump or fall backward onto the floor of the scriptorium.": "陷落附近的地板仍然不稳定。如果一个角色站在洞口边缘的5英尺内（这是为了放下灯光甚至只是往下看而必要的），掷任意骰子；在奇数结果下，崩塌的边缘会崩塌。让角色进行一个{@dc 8}敏捷豁免投掷。如果失败，角色会掉进军械库；如果成功，角色设法跳跃或向后倒在抄写室的地板上。",
	"Although the elves stocked this library with incredible knowledge, there's not much here of interest. When the elves realized the enormity of what this library represented, they cast an enchantment over the place to protect it. Their enchantment threw the library and its contents 100,000 years into the future. That distant age is far beyond the collapse of all predicted civilizations. The elves reasoned that even if the library were discovered to exist in that time, it's unlikely anyone of that era could understand its contents; according to elven oracles, whatever creatures inhabit Midgard 100,000 years in the future will have a completely different understanding of the fundamental underpinnings of magical philosophy. The library could offer no danger to the present; the secrets in its scrolls and books would be accessible only to a modern person who could travel one hundred millennia forward in time and return again. An entity with that sort of power probably already knew most of what the library could teach. Even materials brought back from the future are inextricably tied to the future; they cease to exist in the past and return to the scriptorium of the future after {@dice 1d10} days away.": "尽管精灵们用令人难以置信的知识填满了这个图书馆，但这里并没有太多有趣的东西。当精灵们意识到这个图书馆所代表的巨大意义时，他们对这个地方施加了一种魔法保护。他们的魔法将这个图书馆及其内容投送到了未来的十万年之后。那个遥远的时代远远超出了所有预测文明的崩溃。精灵们推断，即使在那个时候发现了这个图书馆的存在，那个时代的任何人也不太可能理解其中的内容；根据精灵先知的说法，无论未来的米德加德会有什么样的生物，他们对魔法哲学的基本原理会有完全不同的理解。这个图书馆对现在并没有危险；其中卷轴和书籍中的秘密只有现代人才能访问，而这些人必须能够穿越一百万年的时间并再次返回。拥有这种力量的实体可能已经知道了图书馆所能教授的大部分知识。即使从未来带回的材料也与未来紧密相连；它们在过去消失后会在{@dice 1d10}天后返回未来的抄写室。",
	"All the elves' careful planning didn't account for {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}.": "所有精灵们的周密计划都没有考虑到{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}。",
	"In their pride, the elves failed to grasp the few documents they'd left behind explained clearly what they'd done. {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} is not an awesomely powerful mage, but he is ambitious and something of a savant where time is concerned. Once he discovered from documents left in the otherwise abandoned scriptorium that this trove of knowledge existed a mere 100,000 years in the future, he turned his talent to creating the means of accessing it. The result is the {@item time construct|KPSC} in {@area Area 216|SC-216|x}.": "在他们的骄傲中，精灵们未能领会他们留下的少数文件清楚解释了他们所做的事情。{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} 不是一个极其强大的法师，但他雄心勃勃，对时间有一定的天赋。一旦他从留在废弃的书房里的文件中发现，这些知识宝库存在于未来的短短100,000年后，他便将自己的才能转向创造访问它的手段。结果就是{@item time construct|KPSC} 在{@area Area 216|SC-216|x}。",
	"When characters first enter this part of the scriptorium, the floor is littered with debris and there's not much of interest. Little do they know a time-bending construct occupies this space—but only when it's not in the future or the past.": "当角色们第一次进入这部分(`scriptorium`)时，地板上散落着碎片，没有太多有趣的东西。他们并不知道，一个时空扭曲的构造体占据了这个空间——但只有当它不在未来或过去时。",
	"Torn books and crumpled scrolls scattered across desks and otherwise empty shelves indicate this was once part of a great library. If the shelves were filled, it might have been the greatest library outside Zobeck. Whatever secrets it once held, it's now little more than a ruin.": "桌子上散落着撕破的书籍和皱巴巴的卷轴，空荡荡的书架显示这里曾经是一座伟大图书馆的一部分。如果书架上摆满了书，这里可能是除了佐贝克之外最伟大的图书馆。不管它曾经隐藏了什么秘密，现在它只是一座废墟。",
	"In the southern portion of the room, the central area of the floor is oddly free of dust, and the flagstones there are marred by deep scratches in a symmetrical pattern.": "在房间的南部，地板的中心区域异常干净，那里的石板被深深的划痕以对称的方式破坏着。",
	"The scratches on the floor mark the spot where Cagothze built his {@item time construct|KPSC}. That's where it stands— somewhere in time.": "地板上的划痕标记着卡戈斯在那里建造了他的{@item time construct|KPSC}。那就是它所在的地方——在时间的某个角落。",
	"At a moment of your choosing while the characters are in the vicinity, the {@item time construct|KPSC} returns to the present.

When they investigate it, read the description.": "在角色们附近的某个时刻，{@item time construct|KPSC} 返回到现在。它的到来被一声响亮的“咚”声宣布，角色们的耳朵因为构造体突然出现而引起的冲击波而感到一阵堵塞。当他们调查时，请阅读描述。",
	"Standing at the center of the room is a glowing, gold and blue machine unlike anything you've ever seen. Copper and brass cogs, wheels, levers, springs, and spinning governors click, clatter, and ratchet back and forth like a gigantic timepiece. Pulsing blue orbs of polished crystal shine with unearthly light, float silently, or roll effortlessly across the metal surfaces in gravity-defying ways. Cold mist pours off the device, portions of which are caked in frost. Standing near it are two metal-frame humanoid constructs similarly coated with frost. Each of them carries an armful of books, scrolls, and loose sheets of parchment.": "站在房间中央的是一台闪闪发光的金色和蓝色机器，与你以往见过的任何东西都不同。铜和黄铜的齿轮、轮子、杠杆、弹簧和旋转调速器发出咔嗒、咔哒和喀嚓声，如同一个巨大的时钟。闪烁的蓝色水晶球散发着超自然的光芒，静静地漂浮，或者在金属表面上以无重力的方式轻松滚动。冰冷的薄雾从设备上升腾，部分区域覆盖着霜冻。站在附近的是两个同样被霜冻覆盖的金属框架人形构造体。它们每人手里抱着一把书、卷轴和散落的羊皮纸。",
	"When the construct arrives, place the {@area overlay|SC-216-MO|x} portraying the construct on the map and show the players the {@area Point-of-View illustration|SC-216-POV|x} {@homebrew |on page 66}.": "当构造物到达时，在地图上放置{@area overlay|SC-216-MO|x}，并向玩家展示{@area Point-of-View illustration|SC-216-POV|x} {@homebrew |on page 66}。",
	"The humanoid constructs are two {@creature clockwork servant|CCodex|clockwork servants}. They've brought another load of material to the present from 100,000 years in the future. Their only goal is to carry their payload to the scribes in {@area Area 213|SC-213|x} and get back here before the {@item time construct|KPSC} departs again. Since that could happen days from now or minutes from now, they're in no mood to be delayed by interfering strangers. They aren't equipped to put up a fight, but they call {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} for help if they're being prevented from doing their jobs. If it becomes clear {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} isn't around (probably because he was killed by the characters), the clockwork servants become confused and unsure how to react. They deposit their texts on the nearest table and go to find the other clockwork scribes for clarification.": "这两个人形构造体是两个{@creature clockwork servant|CCodex|clockwork servants}。他们从未来的10万年带来了另一批材料到现在。他们唯一的目标是将他们的货物运送给{@area Area 213|SC-213|x}的抄写员，并在{@item time construct|KPSC}再次离开之前回到这里。因为这可能在几天后或几分钟后发生，他们不想被干扰的陌生人耽搁。他们没有准备好进行战斗，但如果他们被阻止完成任务，他们会呼叫{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}寻求帮助。如果明显地{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}不在身边（可能是因为他被角色杀死了），发条仆从会变得困惑不知该如何反应。他们会把文件放在最近的桌子上，然后去找其他发条抄写员澄清情况。",
	"Players are likely to be curious about this device and to pour some effort into investigating it. Try to hold their interest for as long as possible with statements about its intricacy, the unbelievably fine craftsmanship (a gnome character recognizes it as gnomish work), the cold it radiates, the constant crackling of thawing frost, and the way the blue orbs move like part of a machine but with no direct connection to the metal parts. Most of this shouldn't involve skill or ability checks, but if your players like that sort of thing, there's no harm in having them make Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) and Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) checks while they examine the construct and letting them believe they're learning more by doing so. Detect magic reveals that much of the device is magical, involving conjuration, transmutation, and time magic (which is rare enough the characters have probably never encountered it before, in which case the spellcaster might not recognize its aura; it's up to you whether you describe the third type as time magic or as a school unknown to the spellcaster).": "玩家们很可能对这个装置感到好奇，并会投入一些精力进行调查。尽量通过关于其复杂性、难以置信的精湛工艺（一个侏儒角色认出它是侏儒制作的）、它散发的寒冷、持续的霜冻解冻的爆裂声以及蓝色球体移动的方式来保持他们的兴趣，这些球体看起来像机器的一部分，但与金属部件没有直接连接。大部分情况下不需要技能或能力检定，但如果你的玩家喜欢这种事情，让他们在检查这个构造物时进行智力检定（{@skill Arcana}）和智力检定（{@skill Investigation}），让他们相信通过这样做他们正在学到更多。探测魔法会显示这个装置的大部分都是魔法的，涉及到传送、变形和时间魔法（这种魔法很罕见，角色们可能以前从未遇到过，在这种情况下，施法者可能无法认出它的光环；由你决定是否将第三种类型描述为时间魔法，或者作为施法者不知道的一种学派）。",
	"After an indeterminate length of time, the time construct sets off again on another journey through time. You should time this to happen at a dramatically appropriate moment.": "在一个不确定的时间长度之后，时间构造再次启程，开始另一次穿越时间的旅程。你应该在一个戏剧性合适的时刻计时这一事件发生。",
	"The construct (which hasn't stopped flashing, clicking, and whirring since it arrived) stirs into greater activity. The glowing orbs become brighter and rotate faster, the spinning governors speed up, and a growing subsonic hum can be felt through the air and the floor. The two clockwork servants, having delivered their armloads of books, race back to stand at the construct's sides.": "自从抵达以来一直在闪烁、发出咔嗒声和嗡嗡声的构造物开始变得更加活跃。发光的球体变得更明亮，旋转速度加快，旋转的调速器也在加速，一股越来越强的次声音嗡嗡声可以透过空气和地板感觉到。两个发条仆人送完他们手里的一堆书后，飞奔回来站在构造物的两侧。",
	"With a loud \"whump,\" the construct emits a pulse of blue light that engulfs the chamber. You feel as if you're falling through nothingness, your stomach wants to climb up your throat, and the sensation of cold chills you to your bones—until as suddenly as it began, the unnatural motion ends.": "伴随着一声巨大的“轰”声，构造体发出一道蓝光脉冲，将房间吞没。你感觉自己仿佛在无边虚空中坠落，胃部欲冒出喉咙，冰冷的感觉贯穿至骨髓，直到突然停止，那不自然的运动结束了。",
	"Everyone who was pulled along through time by the construct takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) cold damage and is temporally disoriented; a successful {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw halves the damage and prevents being disoriented. The effect of temporal disorientation is identical to being {@condition poisoned} (disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks). Disorientation lasts {@dice 1d4} minutes.": "所有被构造物拉入时间流的人受到 7 点寒冷伤害，并且时间上产生错乱；成功的豁免体质豁免才能减半伤害并防止错乱。时间错乱的效果与被 (失去攻击和技能检定的劣势) 相同。错乱持续 {@dice 1d4} 分钟。",
	"Given the natural caution of adventurers around anything unknown, some characters might try to avoid being drawn along with it. Your best tools here are their curiosity and your ability to make the construct seem fascinating and harmless. The clockwork servants clearly aren't afraid of it. If {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} is alive, he's not afraid of it. Nothing about it looks threatening, and eventually even hardened adventurers are likely to let their guard down and approach within 30 feet—and that's when the construct whisks them away on a quick sidetrack through time.": "鉴于冒险者对未知事物的自然谨慎，一些角色可能会试图避免被卷入其中。在这里，你最好的工具是他们的好奇心，以及你让这个构造物看起来既迷人又无害的能力。发条仆役显然不害怕它。如果{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}还活着，他也不害怕它。它看起来并不具有威胁性，最终，即使是经验丰富的冒险者也可能放松警惕，靠近30英尺——这时，这个构造物会将他们快速带入一个时间的小插曲。",
	"The construct and its \"passengers\" always remain in the same location, but when? Roll {@dice 1d8} and consult the {@table Timeline Destination|KPSC} table to find out. Note unless they meet friendly NPCs, characters have no way of determining exactly what era they've arrived in. All they can do is look at their surroundings and guess.": "这个结构及其“乘客”始终保持在同一位置，但是什么时候呢？掷骰{@dice 1d8}并查阅{@table Timeline Destination|KPSC}表格以找出答案。请注意，除非他们遇到友好的NPC，角色们无法确定自己到底来到了哪个时代。他们所能做的就是观察周围环境并猜测。",
	"These encounters can be expanded however you wish, and the length of time the construct spends in any given era is entirely up to you. As long as the players are enjoying themselves or having an exciting battle, let them stay and interact. The key is always to pull them away just before the situation is entirely resolved. The time construct cares nothing for their interests; it's just trying to relocate the arcane scriptorium. The exception to this is a point where the construct needs to recharge its matrices. You can time this randomly according to the notes in the appendix, or you can cause the recharge in the era you think the characters will most enjoy. What happens during those days is entirely up to you; they can pass quickly with just some desultory exploration through the altered dungeon, or you can design an extensive side quest for the characters.": "这些遭遇可以根据您的意愿进行扩展，构建在任何时代的时间长度完全由您决定。只要玩家们玩得开心或者进行激动人心的战斗，就让他们留下来互动。关键是在情况完全解决之前将他们拉走。时间构建物不关心他们的兴趣；它只是试图重新定位奥术写字室。唯一的例外是构建物需要重新充电其矩阵的时候。您可以根据附录中的笔记随机确定时间，或者在您认为角色们会最享受的时代进行充电。在那些日子里发生的事情完全由您决定；它们可以很快过去，只需通过改变的地牢进行一些散漫的探索，或者您可以为角色设计一个广泛的支线任务。",
	"Far more dangerous than any of the creatures they might meet is the potential for characters to wander away and not return to the time construct when it's ready to depart. The time construct never follows the same route through time twice. In other words, it won't come back for them, so if characters are left behind in the past or the far future, they're unlikely to ever get back to their own time. The {@creature clockwork servant|CCodex|clockwork servants} explain this urgently if characters don't grasp it on their own. Characters left behind are simply out of the campaign unless you decide to deal with them in some other, more forgiving way.": "比他们可能遇到的任何生物更危险的是角色可能会走失，而当时间构造准备离开时，他们可能不会回到那里。时间构造永远不会再次沿着同样的时间路线前进。换句话说，它不会回来找他们，所以如果角色被留在过去或遥远的未来，他们很可能永远无法回到自己的时代。{@creature clockwork servant|CCodex|clockwork servants} 如果角色自己没有意识到这一点，那么请紧急解释这一点。被留在后面的角色除非你决定以其他更宽容的方式处理他们，否则就会被简单地从战役中剔除。",
	"If you plot the characters' journey through time randomly, they arrive at the scriptorium 100,000 years in the future the first time you roll a repeat result. Or, you can send them on a preselected itinerary of your favorites or the eras you think they'll enjoy the most instead.": "如果你随机安排角色的时间旅程，第一次掷出重复结果时，他们会在未来 100,000 年抵达书写室。或者，你可以选择一个你最喜欢的行程，或者你认为他们会喜欢的时代，然后将他们送去那里。",
	"When the time construct eventually brings the characters to the time-displaced scriptorium, read the following:": "当时间构造最终将角色带到时间错位的抄写室时，请阅读以下内容：",
	"Once the queasiness of the time displacement subsides, you see you're back in the scriptorium—but this is the scriptorium in its grandest days, resplendent with elven furnishings. Fresh food and wine are laid out on a table. The shelves are filled with books, scrolls, and loose parchment sheets. There are books in {@language Elvish} with platinum bindings, parchments penned in gold ink in the script of the celestials, even scrolls that appear to have been set down in {@language Primordial} by giants or titans.": "一旦时间错位的不适感消退，你发现自己回到了抄写室——但这是抄写室最辉煌的时刻，装饰着精美的精灵家具。桌子上摆放着新鲜的食物和葡萄酒。书架上摆满了书籍、卷轴和散落的羊皮纸。有些书籍用铂金装订，有些羊皮纸用金墨写成，是天界文字，甚至有些卷轴看起来是由巨人或泰坦用{@language Elvish}记录的。",
	"The {@creature clockwork servant|CCodex|clockwork servants} immediately set to work plucking items off the shelves. They gather up as much as they can carry, which is barely enough to be noticed in this place.": "{@creature clockwork servant|CCodex|clockwork servants} 立即开始从货架上拿取物品。他们尽可能多地收集起来，但在这个地方几乎不足以引起注意。",
	"Thanks to the potent magic of the elves, the library in this era is encased in a protective bubble and shielded against any harm. Nothing that happened to this spot in the past can harm the scriptorium. Thanks to the same magic, characters can't leave the scriptorium. In addition to this area, it consists of {@area Areas 215|SC-215|x} (with intact floor), {@area 217|SC-217|x}, and {@area 218|SC-218|x}, all surrounded by an impenetrable translucent, arcane shell the elves call tangletime. Characters who press their noses against it make out structures in the far distance resembling colossal, inverted pyramids with multilimbed, gargantuan creatures lumbering and soaring around them. These are impressions only; the translucent energy makes it nearly impossible to see anything clearly. If someone insists on trying to get a clearer look, let them attempt a {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. If it succeeds, they see what's out there, and their reward is a {@table long-term madness|DMG} ({@dice 1d10 × 10} hours; see standard rules for details) followed by complete amnesia about what they saw.": "由于精灵强大的魔法，这个时代的图书馆被包裹在一个保护性的泡泡中，免受任何伤害。过去发生在这个地方的事情都无法伤害这个写字室。多亏了同样的魔法，字符无法离开写字室。除了这个区域，它由{@area Areas 215|SC-215|x}(带有完整地板)、{@area 217|SC-217|x}和{@area 218|SC-218|x}组成，所有这些都被一层精灵称为“缠结时光”的坚不可摧的半透明奥术壳所包围。将鼻子贴在上面的字符可以看到远处的结构，看起来像是巨大的倒置金字塔，周围有着多臂、巨大的生物在徘徊和翱翔。这些只是印象；透明的能量使得几乎不可能清晰地看到任何东西。如果有人坚持要试图更清楚地看一看，让他们尝试进行一次{@dc 15}感知({@skill Perception})检定。如果成功，他们会看到外面的景象，他们的奖励是{@table long-term madness|DMG}({@dice 1d10 × 10}小时；详情请参阅标准规则)，然后完全忘记他们看到的内容。",
	"Characters can learn much in this library, if they try. Simply plucking a book off a shelf at random to see what it's about is unlikely to produce much insight. The volumes here are in every known language (and even some the characters have never seen), and they cover subjects from the arcane to the divine to the truly bizarre.": "角色们可以在这个图书馆里学到很多东西，只要他们愿意尝试。随意从书架上拿一本书来看看它是关于什么的，不太可能产生太多的洞察力。这里的书籍涵盖了所有已知的语言（甚至一些角色们从未见过的语言），涵盖了从神秘的到神圣的再到真正奇异的各种主题。",
	"To learn something useful, a character must phrase a clear question and then make a successful {@dc 15} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. If the check succeeds and if the answer is something the elves of a hundred years ago could have known, the character finds a text with the answer. The formula of any spell the character wants to learn can be found this way, as can most historical facts. The library isn't an oracle, a conduit to the gods, or a {@spell commune} or {@spell scrying} spell; it's a mindboggling collection of arcane, divine, and historical lore.": "为了学到有用的知识，角色必须提出一个清晰的问题，然后进行一次成功的{@dc 15} 智力 ({@skill Investigation}) 检定。如果检定成功，且答案是一百年前的精灵可能知道的事情，角色会找到一个包含答案的文本。角色想要学习的任何法术的公式都可以通过这种方式找到，大多数历史事实也是如此。这个图书馆不是神谕，不是与神明的联系，也不是{@spell commune} 或 {@spell scrying} 法术；它是一个令人难以置信的奥术、神圣和历史知识的收藏。",
	"Characters don't have a lot of time here. Once the clockwork servants are loaded up, the time construct is ready to head home. You can be generous and give them up to an hour if they're making good use of it, but as before, the time construct fires up to leave before the characters are entirely ready to go.": "角色们在这里没有太多时间。一旦发条仆役们被装载好，时间构造就准备好回家了。如果他们好好利用时间，你可以慷慨地给他们多达一个小时，但和以前一样，时间构造会在角色们完全准备好离开之前启动。",

	"This is {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}'s personal living chamber and where the characters encounter him if they didn't encounter him elsewhere. The door is always locked. It opens to the stickpin in {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}'s waistcoat or to the key on his ring. The lock can be picked with a successful {@dc 15} Dexterity ({@item Thieves' Tools|PHB}) check.": "这是{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}的个人起居室，如果角色没有在其他地方遇到他，他们会在这里遇到他。门总是锁着的。它可以用{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}背心上的领带别针或他戒指上的钥匙打开。如果成功进行了{@dc 15}敏捷({@item Thieves' Tools|PHB})检定，锁也可以被撬开。",

	"The chest has no apparent lock, but it is magically sealed. The latch opens only for someone wearing {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}'s stickpin. Because there is no lock to pick, the only ways to open the chest are to destroy it (AC 12, 12 hit points) or to cast {@spell dispel magic} on it, which succeeds automatically. The chest contains 828 gp worth of assorted coins from across Midgard, a pair of exquisite gloves embroidered with gold thread (sized for a gnome; 25 gp), matching silver pitcher and goblet bearing {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}'s family crest (which can help characters trace his past, if they take it to a herald for identification; 50 gp total), a framed silhouette of an unidentified gnome ({@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}'s brother) with the words \"Good Riddance\" scribbled across it, a {@item bag of holding}, a {@item Spell Scroll (5th Level)|DMG|spell scroll} of {@spell teleportation circle}, a {@item purple amethyst brooch|KPSC}, a {@item potion of hill giant strength}, and a {@item potion of growth}.

	"The {@item purple amethyst brooch|KPSC|amethyst brooch} is significant on deeper levels of the citadel, where it indicates its wearer is a person of importance to {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} and shouldn't be murdered without good reason. It is not, however, a guarantee of safe passage under all circumstances. Creatures on the lower levels understand symbols can be stolen and used by their enemies, and allowing the wrong person through just because they had a brooch is worse than not allowing the right person through because they didn't. For example, trollkin in the dwarven barracks (Level 3) won't defer to a character just because they have the brooch. It must be brandished as a sign of authority, and the wearer must behave as if they understand its significance. Otherwise, the trollkin assume the characters are murderers and thieves who should be dealt with as harshly as possible. The most likely way for characters to figure this out is by seeing leaders on lower levels wearing similar brooches.": "在城堡更深层次的地方，{@item purple amethyst brooch|KPSC|amethyst brooch} 对于{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}来说具有重要意义，它表明佩戴者是一位重要人物，不应该没有充分理由就被谋杀。然而，在所有情况下，它并不保证安全通行。更低层次的生物明白符号可以被敌人偷走并利用，仅仅因为某人有了这个胸针就放错人通过比因为没有而不让对的人通过更糟糕。例如，在矮人兵营（第3层）的巨魔亲属不会仅仅因为某人有了这个胸针就对其恭敬有加。必须挥舞这个胸针作为权威的标志，佩戴者必须表现得好像他们理解其重要性。否则，巨魔亲属会认为这些角色是谋杀犯和小偷，应该尽可能严厉地对待。角色最有可能弄清楚这一点的方法是看到更低层次的领导者也戴着类似的胸针。",
	"The {@item Spell Scroll (5th Level)|DMG|spell scroll} of {@spell teleportation circle} can be a literal lifesaver on Level 4. Characters aren't out of luck if the scroll is gone by then, but some innocent NPCs are likely to die.": "在{@spell teleportation circle}的{@item Spell Scroll (5th Level)|DMG|spell scroll}在第4级别上可以成为一个真正的救命稻草。如果卷轴在那时消失了，角色们并不会完全没有希望，但一些无辜的NPC很可能会死去。",
	"The books on the desk are highly technical philosophical treatises on the nature of time, with many angry, condescending notes scribbled into the margins in {@language Gnomish}. Characters can deduce the subject from the titles ({@i Intricacies of Time in a Temporally Deconstructed Corpo-reality} and {@i The Enigma of \"Now\" and \"Then\" as Those Terms Relate to Then and Now}), but they have no hope of understanding them without months of study.": "桌子上的书是关于时间本质的高度技术哲学论著，在{@language Gnomish}中有许多愤怒、居高临下的笔记涂鸦在页边。角色们可以从书名({@i Intricacies of Time in a Temporally Deconstructed Corpo-reality}和{@i The Enigma of \"Now\" and \"Then\" as Those Terms Relate to Then and Now})推断出主题，但他们没有希望在没有几个月的学习的情况下理解它们。",

These are intelligent creatures loyal to {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}, and how they react to the gnome's death is up to you. They might simply carry on, or they might look for ways to get vengeance. The time construct is particularly dangerous in this regard, as it both sees {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} as its revered creator and it's capable of fetching powerful creatures from the distant future and past to attack the characters. Dinosaurs have great potential here, but any creature can be used. Better yet, a standard monster can be re-skinned and used as a mutant, a more evolved version of itself, or as something else entirely to keep the players guessing and {@condition frightened}.": "{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}的死并不能阻止时间构造或钟表抄写员们的工作。这些聪明的生物忠诚于{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}，它们如何对待侏儒的死取决于你。它们可能只是继续工作，或者可能寻找报复的方式。时间构造在这方面尤为危险，因为它既将{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}视为尊敬的创造者，又能够从遥远的未来和过去召唤强大的生物来攻击角色。恐龙在这里有很大的潜力，但任何生物都可以被使用。更好的是，一个标准的怪物可以被重新设计外观，用作突变体，更进化的版本，或者完全不同的东西，让玩家猜测和{@condition frightened}。",

	"The dwarf mercenaries who built the citadel 150 years ago and cemented their fortunes to Gerhardt III (through a skillful combination of diplomacy, business sense, and blackmail) excavated this area to build their barracks when they built the above-ground fortress. Gerhardt needed to get the dwarves out of the town of Redtower to reduce friction with the townsfolk. He probably intended for them to simply repurpose the then-abandoned scriptorium, but the dwarves had bigger ideas. They found enough natural caverns beneath the scriptorium— little more than crawlspaces then—to argue to Gerhardt that, with only a few enlargements, they could add a magnificent new level beneath the citadel that would be perfect for their needs and make the citadel impervious to assault. Gerhardt always seemed unable to oppose anything the dwarves wanted, and that's how the castle was raised and an entirely new structure was excavated beneath the scriptorium.": "150年前，矮人雇佣兵们通过一系列巧妙的外交、商业头脑和勒索手段，将他们的命运与格哈德三世（Gerhardt III）紧密联系在一起，建造了这座城堡并在上面的堡垒上建造了他们的兵营。格哈德需要让矮人们离开Redtower镇，以减少与镇上居民的摩擦。他可能本打算让他们简单地重新利用当时废弃的抄写室，但矮人们有了更大的想法。他们在抄写室下面找到了足够的天然洞穴——当时只是一些狭窄的通道——向格哈德辩称，只需稍作扩建，他们就可以在城堡下面增加一个壮丽的新层，完全适合他们的需求，并使城堡无懈可击。格哈德似乎总是无法反对矮人们想要的任何事情，这就是城堡是如何建起来的，一个全新的结构被挖掘在抄写室下面。",
	"History records the dwarves who moved into the citadel were accompanied by a few powerful mages. These were, in fact, dwarven ring mages—masters of a school of magic that was as poorly understood outside the closed society of the dwarves then as it is now. The reason Gerhardt seldom said no to any request from the dwarves was they'd gifted him a valuable ring as a tribute and as recognition of his lordship over the area when they first arrived. The gold ring set with fiery yellow sapphires bore the Dwarvish inscription, \"Upon the Baron's hand, this ring guarantees service of the folk of Alpentor.\" The inscription was true, but it didn't mean what Gerhardt understood it to mean. The wearer of the ring was compelled to serve the folk of Alpentor, not the other way round. Without ever suspecting, Gerhardt was manipulated into always seeing the actions and the requests of the dwarves in the most benevolent, generous light.": "历史记载着那些搬进城堡的矮人是由一些强大的法师陪伴着。事实上，这些法师是矮人戒指法师——一种在矮人封闭社会之外当时就像现在一样鲜为人知的魔法流派的大师。格哈特很少拒绝矮人的任何请求的原因是，当他们第一次到来时，他们送给他一枚珍贵的戒指作为致意，并承认他对该地区的领主地位。这枚镶有火红黄宝石的金戒指上刻着矮人文，“在男爵的手上，这枚戒指保证为Alpentor的人民提供服务。”这个铭文是真实的，但并不意味着格哈特理解的那样。戴上这枚戒指的人被迫为Alpentor的人民提供服务，而不是相反。格哈特从未怀疑过，总是被操纵着以最仁慈、慷慨的光线看待矮人的行动和请求。",
	"The dwarves occupied these halls for less than forty years. Gerhardt III died tragically when one of the dwarves' {@creature dire owlbear|KPSC|dire owlbears} ran amok. His son, Gerhardt IV, allowed the mercenary dwarves to launch a wave of banditry across the territory. Some histories say he encouraged the outlawry or even joined in. It's beyond question that Gerhardt IV profited from it. When the outrages eventually became unbearable, knights of Khors reduced the citadel. The surface structures were burned, driving the defenders underground, where they were weakened by a siege and crushed in a final assault.": "这些大厅被矮人占据不到四十年。Gerhardt III 在矮人中的{@creature dire owlbear|KPSC|dire owlbears}之一发狂时不幸身亡。他的儿子 Gerhardt IV 允许雇佣的矮人在领土上发动了一波土匪行动。一些历史记载称他鼓励了这种暴行，甚至参与其中。毫无疑问，Gerhardt IV 从中获利。当暴行变得无法忍受时，Khors 的骑士们攻陷了这座城堡。地面建筑被焚烧，迫使守卫者退入地下，在那里他们被围困并在最后一次攻击中被击溃。",
	"Not long after, the dwarven barracks level was taken over by a clan of savage trollkin along with a few troll allies, a pack of lich hounds, and the descendants of the dwarves' dire owlbears. Gellert keeps them under control (mostly) through {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}, but the trollkin are growing unhappy about the arrangement.": "不久之后，矮人兵营层被一群野蛮的巨魔族占领，还有几个巨魔盟友、一群巫妖猎犬，以及矮人恐猛猫的后代。盖勒特通过{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}勉强控制住它们，但巨魔族对这种安排感到不满。",
	"Aside from a portion of the level comprising a few dwarven tombs, there's little mystery here. The trollkin and trolls live in dilapidated splendor and grumble about not being given a free hand to pillage as they please.": "除了一部分由几座矮人墓组成的区域外，这里几乎没有什么神秘之处。巨魔族和巨魔们生活在破败的辉煌中，抱怨没有得到自由掠夺的机会。",
	"While running this level, keep in mind it isn't meant to play out like a standard dungeon crawl, with explorers moving quietly into a room, slaughtering everything they meet, then moving unnoticed to the next room until the level is clear. The inhabitants here don't sit in one place waiting to be found and killed. They move around constantly in the process of going about their duties, and the lich hounds are adept at sniffing out intruders. There are too many enemies here, and they're too well organized, for a small party of 5th-level characters to scythe through in one go.": "在跑这个关卡的时候，请记住这不是一个标准的地牢探险，探险者们悄悄地走进一个房间，杀死他们遇到的一切，然后悄无声息地移动到下一个房间，直到关卡清空。这里的居民不会坐在一个地方等待被发现和杀死。他们不断地四处移动，忙于完成自己的任务，而巫妖猎犬擅长嗅出入侵者。这里的敌人太多了，而且他们组织得太好了，对于一个由五级角色组成的小队来说，一次性消灭他们是不可能的。",
	"Characters need to tackle these trollkin in a series of forays punctuated with periods of rest. This level is designed to become a running game of cat and mouse, with the characters falling back to what they think is a safe area, the trollkin seeking them out, characters falling back, etc. In this fight, the characters should never be allowed to rest and recover anywhere near the citadel. As long as they remain in the neighborhood, they can only grow weaker while the trollkin pursuers continually replenish their force with fresh replacements. The only place characters are guaranteed to find refuge is back in Redtower.": "角色需要在一系列突袭中应对这些巨魔族（trollkin），并在休息期间加以调整。这一关卡旨在成为一场猫鼠游戏，角色不断后撤至他们认为安全的区域，巨魔族寻找他们，角色再次后撤，如此往复。在这场战斗中，角色不应被允许在堡垒附近休息和恢复。只要他们留在附近，他们只会变得越来越虚弱，而巨魔族的追击者则会不断用新的替补补充他们的力量。角色唯一有保障的避难所是回到红塔（Redtower）。",
	"The trollkin do everything in their power to kill their enemies. The sooner the players understand this, the more likely their characters are to survive. The worst thing the party can do here is underestimate the opposition. That mistake is almost guaranteed to get them all killed.": "巨魔族竭尽全力杀死他们的敌人。玩家们越早明白这一点，他们的角色就越有可能幸存下来。队伍在这里能犯的最严重错误就是低估对手。这个错误几乎肯定会导致他们全部丧生。",
	"With the exception of the tombs—which can't be entered until most of the level is explored—no place on this level is safe for characters to take even a short rest while the trollkin remain active. As soon as any sign of intruders is noticed—a body, a blood smear, an open door that should be closed—a determined hunt is launched.": "除了墓穴（直到大部分区域被探索后才能进入）之外，这个层次上没有任何地方对角色来说是安全的，即使是短暂的休息也不行，因为巨魔族仍然活跃。一旦发现任何入侵者的迹象——尸体、血迹、本应关闭的敞开的门——他们就会发起一场坚决的追捕。",
	"Holing up in the scriptorium is also a bad idea; trollkin scouts quickly report everyone above is dead, which prompts more trollkin and lich hounds to scour that level for enemies too, plus {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}'s areas and even the surface ruins. Once the trollkin are on the hunt, the only spots they don't search are the secret rooms used by the dust goblins ({@area Areas 204|SC-204|x} and {@area 205|SC-205|x}), which they don't know about, and the Holzanger ancestral shrine and crypts ({@area Areas 113|SC-113|x} through {@area 119|SC-119|x}), which are unsafe.": "躲在抄写室里也不是个好主意；巨魔侦察兵很快就会报告楼上的每个人都死了，这促使更多的巨魔和巫妖猎犬搜索那一层的敌人，还有{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}的区域，甚至地面上的废墟。一旦巨魔开始猎杀，他们不搜索的唯一地方是尘精灵使用的秘密房间({@area Areas 204|SC-204|x}和{@area 205|SC-205|x})，因为他们不知道，以及Holzanger家族神殿和地下墓穴({@area Areas 113|SC-113|x}到{@area 119|SC-119|x})，那里很危险。",
	"Even if the characters find a safe hiding spot, the trollkin and their allies are on high alert from that time on. They post sentries in the ruins to report when anyone approaches, they guard every staircase and entrance, they patrol aggressively all the time, and they're impossible to surprise without magical aid. If characters hide in {@area Areas 204|SC-204|x} or {@area 205|SC-205|x}, they hear trollkin and lich hounds moving and searching in the corridor outside. Furthermore, if characters return to the same hiding spot a second time, trollkin scouts detect it, and they either launch an assault, arrange an ambush, or set up to starve the characters out.": "即使角色找到了一个安全的藏身之处，巨魔族和他们的盟友从那时起就保持高度警惕。他们在废墟中设置哨兵以报告任何接近的人，他们守卫每个楼梯和入口，他们一直积极巡逻，并且没有魔法帮助的话很难被突袭。如果角色躲在{@area Areas 204|SC-204|x}或{@area 205|SC-205|x}，他们会听到巨魔族和巫妖猎犬在外面的走廊中移动和搜索。此外，如果角色第二次返回相同的藏身地点，巨魔族侦察兵会察觉到，他们会发动突袭、设下伏击，或者设法饿死角色。",
	"casting {@spell thunderwave}, for example—or they dropped lights down through the hole in the floor, the trollkin already know intruders are in the citadel. That puts them on low-level alert, which means two guards are posted in {@area Area 302|SC-302|x} where they can see both staircases.": "施放{@spell thunderwave}，例如——或者他们通过地板上的洞口放下灯光，巨魔已经知道有入侵者进入了城堡。这让他们处于低级警戒状态，这意味着有两名卫兵被派到{@area Area 302|SC-302|x}，可以看到两个楼梯。",
	"Some descriptions mention the trollkin having barricades or building barricades in response to attacks. These are more than mere overturned furniture.

	"When trollkin erect barricades \"across\" doorways, they build them 5 feet back from the opening so attackers must step through the doorway to reach the barricade, where they'll be surrounded on three sides by trollkin. the first time the characters encounter one of these barricades, show the players the {@area Point-of-View illustration|SC-BAR-POV|x} {@homebrew |on page 70}.": "当巨魔族竖立路障“横跨”门口时，他们会在开口处后面5英尺处建造路障，这样攻击者必须踏入门口才能到达路障，而他们将被巨魔族围在三面。第一次角色们遇到这样的路障时，向玩家展示{@area Point-of-View illustration|SC-BAR-POV|x} {@homebrew |on page 70}。",
	"Trollkin are taller than humans to begin with, and they stand on low platforms behind the barricades to make them even taller, so they can fight across a barricade without hindrance. Medium creatures attacking trollkin defenders across a barricade have disadvantage on melee attacks. Trollkin fighting in melee have half cover (+2 AC, +2 on saving throws) against ranged attacks. Trollkin who are not in melee—for example, if characters hang back and pepper the barricade with ranged attacks only—can hunker down and gain three-quarters cover (+5 to AC and saving throws) while using their {@item longbow|PHB|longbows}.": "巨魔血统者本来就比人类高，他们站在低平台后面的栅栏上，使自己更高，这样他们就可以在没有阻碍的情况下越过栅栏进行战斗。攻击栅栏后面的巨魔血统防御者的中等生物在进行近战攻击时有劣势。在近战中战斗的巨魔血统者对远程攻击有半掩护（+2 AC，+2豁免）。巨魔血统者如果不参与近战——例如，如果角色们退后并只用远程攻击攻击栅栏——可以蹲下并获得四分之三掩护（+5 AC和豁免），同时使用他们的{@item longbow|PHB|longbows}。",
	"Small creatures can't make melee attacks across a barricade at all unless they're using a weapon with reach.": "小型生物在(《龙与地下城》)中无法通过障碍物进行近战攻击，除非它们使用具有延长距离的武器。",
	"A creature whose melee attack roll across a barricade is a natural 1 takes 3 ({@damage 1d6}) piercing damage from a spear, a stake, or an old sword blade embedded in the barricade.": "当一只生物在穿越栅栏时的近战攻击骰结果为自然1时，会受到3点穿刺伤害，来自栅栏上插入的一支长矛、木桩或旧剑刃。",
	"In the course of running this level, you will be tempted to go easy on the characters and let them hew through disorganized enemies, rest where no rest should be possible, fight more enemies who didn't react to the previous battle for no good reason, rest again in an impossible place, and so on. Don't do it! Don't cheapen the players' victory by letting them win without a struggle. To prevail here, characters need to think tactically. They need to know when to kick in the front door and when to sneak in the back, when to put their backs to the wall and fight to the end and when to run like rabbits.": "在完成这个级别的过程中，你可能会受到诱惑，让角色轻松地穿过杂乱的敌人，休息在本不应该休息的地方，与更多没有理由参与上一场战斗的敌人战斗，再次在不可能的地方休息，等等。不要这样做！不要通过让他们毫不费力地获胜来贬低玩家的胜利。要在这里取胜，角色需要进行战术思考。他们需要知道何时踢开前门，何时悄悄溜进后门，何时背靠墙壁战斗到底，何时像兔子一样逃跑。",
	"No trick or tactic the characters devise should ever work twice. These trollkin are not just obstacles to be plowed through. They are smart, tough, motivated warriors who want to win this fight as badly as the players do, who have nothing to gain by fighting fair or being merciful, and who are defending their home.": "角色设计的任何诡计或策略都不应该第二次奏效。这些巨魔族不仅仅是可以轻易碾压的障碍物。他们是聪明、坚韧、积极进取的战士，他们渴望像玩家一样赢得这场战斗，他们没有任何理由去公平战斗或仁慈，他们是在保卫自己的家园。",
	"Overconfident characters can quickly become overwhelmed on this level. This is especially true if they recklessly stay and fight when they should run, as characters tend to do, or get careless and leave an open path for trollkin to get behind them and cut off their path of retreat. The fact the entry hall can be approached from the north and the south makes it easy for trollkin to surround reckless foes, and they do if given the opportunity.": "在这个层次上，过于自信的角色很快就会变得不堪重负。特别是当他们鲁莽地选择留下来战斗而不是逃跑时，这一点尤为明显，正如角色们倾向于做的那样，或者疏忽大意地留下一个开放的路径，让巨魔族人得以绕到他们身后，切断他们的撤退路线。入口大厅可以从北边和南边接近，这让巨魔族人很容易包围鲁莽的敌人，如果有机会的话，他们会这样做。",
	"If characters find themselves hopelessly overwhelmed, trollkin knock them out and take them prisoner rather than kill them. The characters wake up stripped of armor and weapons, securely tied and gagged, in {@area Area 311|SC-311|x} where trollkin can humiliate them by jeering at them and throwing rotten food on them. They take special pains to make sure spellcasters can't use their hands or their voices. They don't kill the captives, however, without permission from {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}.": "如果角色发现自己被压倒性地压制，巨魔族会将他们击昏并俘虏，而不是杀死他们。角色们醒来时被剥夺了盔甲和武器，被牢固地捆绑和堵嘴，位于{@area Area 311|SC-311|x}，巨魔族可以通过嘲笑和扔腐烂食物来羞辱他们。他们特别注意确保法师无法使用他们的手或声音。然而，他们不会在未经{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}允许的情况下杀死俘虏。",

	"Characters are held captive for months, during which {@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC} and Giydya have many long, in-depth conversations with them. Allow the characters to make a group {@dc 13} Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If it succeeds, {@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC} or Giydya eventually slips a knife to the most charismatic character. It's up to the party to choose the right moment to make an escape attempt.": "角色被囚禁数月，期间{@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC}和吉迪娅(Giydya)与他们进行了许多长时间、深入的对话。允许角色进行一次团队{@dc 13} 魅力 ({@skill Persuasion}) 检定。如果成功，{@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC}或吉迪娅最终会将一把刀偷偷交给最有魅力的角色。逃跑的时机取决于队伍选择的时刻。",

	"As this battle unfolds, you're responsible for commanding the trollkin forces. You must lead them smartly. One way to deal with this is to decide how the trollkin rearrange their defenses between fights before you hear the characters' new plan. That way you'll be less tempted to put your finger on the scale in either the party's or the trollkin's favor.": "随着战斗的进行，你负责指挥巨魔部队。你必须明智地领导他们。处理这种情况的一种方法是在听到角色们的新计划之前决定巨魔如何重新布置防御。这样你就不会被诱惑在支持任何一方（队伍或巨魔）时偏袒其中一方。",

The two other reavers are his lieutenants, Egail and Gostov. {@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC} is a veteran of many raids that taught him the value of patience and planning. Egail is a young hothead who wants only to kill enemies and gain glory. Gostov looks up to {@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC} and respects his wisdom but also grows impatient with prolonged inactivity.": "巨魔人族首领是一名名叫{@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC}的掠夺者。另外两名掠夺者是他的副手，埃盖尔和戈斯托夫。{@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC}是一位经历过许多劫掠的老手，这让他明白了耐心和计划的重要性。埃盖尔是一个年轻的火爆分子，只想杀敌取得荣耀。戈斯托夫尊敬{@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC}并钦佩他的智慧，但也对长时间的无所作为感到不耐烦。",
	"The two shamans are Giydya and Sassigne. Giydya is utterly loyal to {@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC}. She would (and has) killed other trollkin to enforce the chieftain's decrees. Sassigne is a fanatical follower of {@deity Thor|Norse|PHB}, but this zealotry is mostly a front to cover up Sassigne's true devotion to Chernobog, whose rites were banned by {@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC}.": "这两位萨满是吉迪亚 (Giydya) 和萨西涅 (Sassigne)。吉迪亚对{@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC}绝对忠诚。她曾经为了执行酋长的命令而杀害其他巨魔人。萨西涅是{@deity Thor|Norse|PHB}的狂热追随者，但这种狂热大多是为了掩盖萨西涅对切尔诺博格 (Chernobog) 的真正忠诚，而切尔诺博格的仪式被{@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC}禁止。",
	"The two shamans generally don't prepare {@spell dominate beast} spells here because the lich hounds and dire owlbears aren't beasts (and they're someone else's responsibility anyway).

It's possible characters found this entrance earlier, but it's more likely they learn of it by following the stairs upward from here. This is a long climb: about 140 feet from here to the surface (the equivalent of a modern ten-story building). The stairs are not completely intact. Many steps have collapsed, leaving gaps big enough to fall through. These are easy to spot and avoid for anyone with {@sense darkvision} or a light and who isn't in too much of a hurry. If characters are racing up these steps trying to keep ahead of pursuers or they're moving blind, then a successful {@dc 10} Dexterity saving throw is needed to not put a foot through one of the holes.

	"The dwarves intended this hall to make an impression on visitors. Despite battle damage, it's still striking.": "矮人们打算让这个大厅给访客留下深刻印象。尽管受到战斗损坏，它仍然很引人注目。",
	"Although this hall bears the scars of battering rams and century-old magical detonations, the square-cut engaged columns and knotted, runic designs still exhibit the pride and craftsmanship of the dwarves who built it. Two gaps in the eastern wall indicate how fiercely the battle for the citadel raged. One of them probably was a doorway originally and the other is a breach created by the attackers. Now both are so battered, it's impossible to tell which is which. Twisted hinges indicate a corridor to the south once had ornamental doors at this end.": "虽然这个大厅上留下了撞击槌和百年魔法爆炸的痕迹，但方形的附柱和纠结的符文设计仍展示了矮人建造者的自豪和工艺。东墙上的两个缺口显示了这座城堡的激烈战斗。其中一个可能原本是一个门道，而另一个是攻击者造成的缺口。现在两者都已经被破坏得面目全非，无法分辨哪个是哪个。扭曲的铰链表明南边的走廊曾经在这一端有装饰门。",

	"A {@spell knock} spell also opens these doors—and triggers a {@spell glyph of warding}.

In fact, it was begun on this side by the attackers, but they stopped before cutting through. Then the dwarves burst through the wall from the east side to launch an attack from behind against the knights engaged in the workroom and the armory. A dwarf with the Stonecunning trait can figure this out after examining the breach for 5 minutes.": "连接到{@area Areas 305|SC-305|x}和{@area 312|SC-312|x}的通道都是破口，而不是正常的门道。通向{@area Area 305|SC-305|x}的破口是由Khors骑士们从这一侧创造的。另一个破口是从哪一侧创造的并不清楚。事实上，进攻者们在这一侧开始了破口，但在切割到一半时停了下来。然后，矮人们从东侧冲破墙壁，从后方对从事工作和军械库的骑士们发动了攻击。具有石工技能特性的矮人在检查破口5分钟后可以弄清楚这一情况。",
	"The missing doors at the north end of this hallway were flimsy and ornamental. Their main purpose was to make intruders think this passage is less dangerous than it is.

When they first came to the area, they were mercenaries no different from any other group of soldiers for hire. The exceptions were Captain Chansar and his right hand, the ring mystic Valence Hellhand. Their goal was nothing less than eventual dominion over the region and the establishment of their own dynasty. Hellhand crafted the ring they gave Gerhardt III ({@item Gerhardt's Bargain|KPSC}), and together they twisted his will to match their own desires. Once they had a secure base with Gerhardt's blessing, they set about subduing the countryside through terror and chaos.": "{@creature Chansar the Pale|KPSC}船长是自他们首次接近Gerhardt III直到被Khors骑士推翻的猩红城堡矮人的领袖。城堡的矮人参与了猖獗的抢劫和更糟糕的行为，但他们起初并不是贼和杀人犯。当他们第一次来到这个地区时，他们只是一群普通的雇佣士兵。唯一的例外是船长Chansar和他的得力助手，戒指秘术师Valence Hellhand。他们的目标绝不仅仅是最终统治该地区，建立自己的王朝。Hellhand制作了他们赠送给Gerhardt III的戒指({@item Gerhardt's Bargain|KPSC})，然后他们一起扭曲他的意志以符合他们自己的欲望。一旦他们得到Gerhardt的祝福并确立了一个安全的基地，他们就开始通过恐怖和混乱来征服乡间。",

	"That account is only partially correct. Chansar was carried off the walls mortally wounded. He could have been saved with magic, but he and Hellhand had other plans. He was placed in his tomb while still barely alive, along with magical amulets and other preparations. Hellhand and their five most loyal fanatics—the Pale Circle—were to be sealed into the tomb with Chansar. When the time was right, after the citadel had fallen and been occupied anew by the knights of Khors, they would emerge as undead, have their vengeance, and resume their quest for lordship over the area.": "那个记载只是部分正确。钱萨尔被搬离城墙时已经身受致命伤。他本可以通过魔法得救，但他和赫尔汉德有其他计划。他被放入墓穴时仍然勉强活着，伴随着魔法护身符和其他准备。赫尔汉德和他们五个最忠诚的狂热追随者——苍白之环——将被封闭在与钱萨尔一起的墓穴中。当时机成熟，当城堡倒塌并被科尔斯骑士重新占领时，他们将作为不死之身出现，展开复仇，并继续他们对该地区领主地位的追求。",

A spark from static electricity or even a rap with knuckles is enough. If the {@creature ring warden wight|KPSC} in Chansar's tomb cast {@spell reverberate|KPDM} or if one of the characters cast {@spell thunderwave}, the door absorbs enough thunder to last 30 minutes. Opening the door this way causes it to slowly sink until the top is level with the floor.": "正确的方法是从{@area Area 315|SC-315|x}触摸索尔小锤，同时将云和闪电符号暴露给雷鸣、电击或物理冲击。静电火花甚至用指关节敲击都足够了。如果在Chansar的墓中{@creature ring warden wight|KPSC}施放{@spell reverberate|KPDM}，或者其中一个角色施放{@spell thunderwave}，门会吸收足够的雷电，持续30分钟。用这种方式打开门会导致门缓慢下沉，直到顶部与地板齐平。",
	"The wrong way involves casting {@spell knock}. This opens the door but also sets off an explosive {@spell glyph of warding} that deals 22 ({@damage 5d8}) thunder damage to everyone within 20 feet of the door, or half damage with a successful {@dc 17} Dexterity saving throw. Opening the door this way causes it to drop suddenly into the floor, but it skews and jams in place with about 3 feet of door still blocking the lower portion of the doorway. Characters can step over it without risk.": "错误的方法涉及施放{@spell knock}。这打开了门，但也引爆了一个爆炸物{@spell glyph of warding}，对门口20英尺范围内的所有人造成22({@damage 5d8})点雷属性伤害，或者在成功的{@dc 17}敏捷豁免才能减半伤害。用这种方式打开门会导致它突然掉入地板，但它会歪斜并卡在那里，门的下部仍有大约3英尺的门板挡住门口的下部。角色可以毫无风险地跨过它。",
	"This small chamber contains only three items: two unlit braziers and a towering statue of Thor. The statue is 8 feet tall and portrays Thor as a gigantic, muscular figure with dwarven features and a stern scowl on his face. Its hands grip the handle of a massive, inverted hammer.": "这个小房间里只有三样东西：两个未点燃的火盆和一个高耸的索尔雕像。这座雕像有8英尺高，描绘了索尔是一个巨大、肌肉发达、有着矮人特征和一张严厉的脸庞的形象。它的双手握着一把巨大的倒置锤的把手。",
	"The chamber actually contains a fourth item. Tucked behind the northern brazier is a ceramic jar containing peppercorns, juniper sprigs, dill, caraway seeds, powdered iron, and slivered rams' horn, all dry and crumbling. Characters find the jar if someone specifically looks behind the braziers or they search the room and make a successful {@dc 12} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check.": "房间实际上还有第四件物品。藏在北部火盆后面的是一个陶罐，里面装满了胡椒粒、刺柏枝、莳萝、茴香籽、铁粉和切碎的羊角，都是干燥脆散的。人物可以在特意查看火盆后面或搜索房间并成功进行一次{@dc 12}感知({@skill Perception})检定后找到这个陶罐。",
	"The statue of Thor houses a {@creature ring servant|CCodex} (Creature Codex), a tremendously powerful creation of Valence Hellhand and the other ring wardens. Its task was to act as guardian of {@creature Chansar the Pale|KPSC} and the Pale Circle after their reawakening.": "索尔雕像内部寄局着一个{@creature ring servant|CCodex}（生物编目）, 由瓦伦斯·赫尔汉德和其他环守者创造的强大存在。它的任务是在{@creature Chansar the Pale|KPSC}和苍白之环复苏后充当守护者。",
	"What happens in this shrine depends on what characters do here and what they did in the two burial chambers.": "这座神殿发生的事情取决于角色在这里做了什么，以及他们在两个埋葬室中做了什么。",
	"If characters open the shrine before fighting the wights in Chansar's tomb, the {@creature ring servant|CCodex} activates 1 round into that fight and joins in on the side of the wights, almost guaranteeing the party will die. Urge them to run if they can.": "如果角色在与(%Chansar's Tomb%)中的幽灵战斗前打开神龛，{@creature ring servant|CCodex}会在战斗进行到第1回合时激活，并加入幽灵一方，几乎可以肯定地导致队伍全灭。如果可以的话，强烈建议他们逃跑。",
	"If characters defeat the wights before opening Thor's shrine, the {@creature ring servant|CCodex} activates and attacks them if any character is carrying the ring-staff, Chansar's silver crown, or Chansar's battleaxe. It doesn't care about the {@item ring of evasion} or anything else from the tomb.": "如果角色在打开索尔神龛之前击败了尸鬼，{@creature ring servant|CCodex}会激活并攻击他们，如果任何角色携带着戒指杖、钱萨的银冠或钱萨的战斧。它不会关心墓穴中的{@item ring of evasion}或其他任何物品。",
	"If characters light the two braziers in the shrine and pour some of the ritual powder from the ceramic jug into each brazier, the {@creature ring servant|CCodex} won't activate (if it hasn't already). If it has activated, it stops fighting, returns to the shrine, and becomes inactive. It remains inactive for as long as the braziers and powder burn (the powder lasts {@dice 2d4} hours) or until it takes damage. If it reactivates because of damage, it fights until it's destroyed. The braziers can be kept lit for days with charcoal from the forge in the armory ({@area Area 304|SC-304|x}).": "如果角色点燃神龛中的两个火盆，并向每个火盆中倒入陶罐中的一些仪式粉末，{@creature ring servant|CCodex} 就不会激活（如果尚未激活）。如果已经激活，它会停止战斗，返回神龛，并变为不活跃状态。它会保持不活跃状态，直到火盆和粉末燃烧完毕（粉末可以持续{@dice 2d4}小时），或者直到受到伤害。如果因受到伤害而重新激活，它会战斗直到被摧毁。火盆可以使用军械库中熔炉的木炭保持点燃数天（{@area Area 304|SC-304|x}）。",

They stay there until the {@creature ring servant|CCodex} ({@area Area 309|SC-309|x}) is destroyed. The monoliths take no part in combat unless they take damage from a character. As long as the monolith footmen aren't fighting, characters can move through their spaces unobstructed. However, once the {@creature ring servant|CCodex} activates, moving through a monolith footman's space triggers an {@action opportunity attack} from its weapon. These monolith footmen have unlimited reactions for the purpose of making {@action opportunity attack|PHB|opportunity attacks} against creatures moving through their space. They move out of the doorway only to allow the {@creature ring servant|CCodex} through.": "在这场战斗中，来自{@area Area 315|SC-315|x}的两个{@creature monolith footman|ToB|monolith footmen}（假设它们完好无损）保持不动，站在楼梯顶部，挡住了门口。它们会一直待在那里，直到{@creature ring servant|CCodex}（{@area Area 309|SC-309|x}）被摧毁。这些巨石雕像在没有受到角色伤害时不参与战斗。只要巨石步兵没有参与战斗，角色可以毫无阻碍地穿过它们的位置。然而，一旦{@creature ring servant|CCodex}激活，穿过巨石步兵的位置会触发其武器的{@action opportunity attack}。这些巨石步兵在对穿过它们位置的生物进行{@action opportunity attack|PHB|opportunity attacks}时具有无限的反应机会。它们只会在门口移开，以便{@creature ring servant|CCodex}通过。",
	"the construct remains active. Anytime they return to this dungeon level, it attacks them if it can. It doesn't necessarily return to the shrine; it can be anywhere on the map. (Parking it in {@area Area 317|SC-317|x} right next to the hole in the floor would be a bit much, at least right away. Give the characters some chance to evade it through good tactics.) If characters use the owlbears' tunnel to sneak in and out, they might find the tunnel collapsed the next time they return. Once activated, the {@creature ring servant|CCodex} knows its enemies and seeks revenge for {@creature Chansar the Pale|KPSC}, but it doesn't leave the dungeon unless you decide otherwise.": "该构造物仍然保持活跃。每当他们返回这个地牢层级时，如果可能的话，它会攻击他们。它不一定会返回到神龛；它可能出现在地图的任何地方。 (把它停放在{@area Area 317|SC-317|x}靠近地板上的洞旁边可能有点过分，至少一开始是这样。给角色一些通过良好策略躲避它的机会。) 如果角色使用猫头鹰熊的隧道进行潜入和逃离，他们可能会发现下次返回时隧道已经塌陷。一旦激活，{@creature ring servant|CCodex}认识它的敌人并为{@creature Chansar the Pale|KPSC}寻求复仇，但除非你另有决定，否则它不会离开地牢。",
	"Even if characters deactivate the construct by lighting the braziers and burning ceremonial powder, the braziers eventually burn out or the powder runs out and it reactivates.": "即使角色通过点燃火盆和燃烧仪式粉末来停止构造物，火盆最终会熄灭或粉末用尽，它会重新激活。",
	"If possible, {@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC} tries to lure attackers up this murderous corridor. He might do that by posting a weak defense in the armory with orders to fight only briefly and then retreat through here.

	"There's no read-aloud description for this area. When characters open the doors, casually tell them, \"It's what it looks like: a 70-foot corridor with arrow slits on the north and south walls and doors at both ends.\"": "这个区域没有朗读描述。当角色打开门时，轻松地告诉他们：“这就是它看起来的样子：一条70英尺长的走廊，北墙和南墙上有箭孔，两端各有一扇门。”",
	"Besides the arrow slits lining the sides, which are apparent, the hallway contains three separate traps: a pit trap near the west end, a spear trap in the middle, and a crossbow trap at the east end.

	"If characters search for traps, what they find depends on how and where they search. If characters are being shot at through the arrow slits, they have disadvantage when checking for traps.": "如果角色搜索陷阱，他们发现的取决于他们如何以及在哪里搜索。如果角色在箭矢射孔处遭受攻击，他们在检查陷阱时有劣势。",
	"All three of these traps are triggered manually by creatures watching through the arrow slits. The triggers are rigged with pull cords so anyone next to an arrow slit in {@area Area 311|SC-311|x} or {@area 317|SC-317|x} can trigger any of the traps as a reaction. They try to catch as many characters as possible with each trap.": "这三个陷阱都是由通过箭孔观察的生物手动触发的。触发器装有拉绳，因此在{@area Area 311|SC-311|x}或{@area 317|SC-317|x}旁边的任何人都可以作为一次反应来触发任何陷阱。它们试图用每个陷阱捕捉尽可能多的角色。",
	"The pit trap is 30 feet from the western door. A successful {@dc 14} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check made within 5 feet of the trap spots the collapsing floor tiles, indicating there's a pit underneath. {@skill Perception} indicates only that a 10-foot-by-10-foot area of the floor is dangerous.": "坑陷位于西门的30英尺处。在距陷阱5英尺内成功进行的{@dc 14}智力检定({@skill Investigation})可以发现地板瓷砖会坍塌，表明下面有个坑。{@skill Perception}只能表明地板上的一个10英尺乘10英尺的区域是危险的。",

To enter a space containing spears, a character must make a successful {@dc 11} Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check and expend 10 feet of movement. The check can be repeated multiple times per turn, either to enter multiple spaces or while trying to enter one space multiple times.": "一旦投掷出长矛陷阱，长矛就成为了移动的障碍。要进入一个有长矛的区域，角色必须进行一次成功的{@dc 11}敏捷({@skill Acrobatics})检定，并消耗10英尺的移动力。这个检定可以在一个回合内多次重复，可以是为了进入多个区域，也可以是在尝试多次进入一个区域时。",

This isn't guaranteed; {@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC} might decide being able to move through the door quickly to get behind enemies is more important than blocking this entrance. If the doors aren't blocked, there are two rubble-filled barrels near the doors, and those barrels can be heaved into blocking positions in 2 rounds. If the doors are blocked, they can be forced open with a {@spell knock} spell, a successful {@dc 20} Strength check, or destroyed (AC 15, 20 hit points).": "走廊东端的两扇门没有锁。通往马厩的门（{@area Area 317|SC-317|x}）正常打开。通往大厅的门（{@area Area 311|SC-311|x}）北侧无法用横木栓上，但是巨魔可能用填满瓦砾的桶将其堵住。这并非一定；{@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC}可能会决定能够迅速穿过门后面来到敌人身后比堵住这个入口更重要。如果门没有被堵塞，门附近有两个填满瓦砾的桶，这些桶可以在2回合内被推到堵住的位置。如果门被堵塞，可以用{@spell knock}法术、成功的{@dc 20}力量检定或摧毁（AC 15，20点生命值）来强行打开。",

	"{@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC} would prefer not to stage a final defense here for the same reasons he doesn't want a pitched battle in the armory: he believes wide-open space favors the intruders, who probably have plenty of magic to throw around. He'd rather keep them bottled up in corridors or fight them from behind barricades.": "{@creature Bjrnyar|KPSC} 不愿在这里进行最后防御，原因与他不想在军械库进行激烈战斗相同：他认为开阔的空间有利于入侵者，他们可能有很多魔法可以施展。他宁愿将他们困在走廊里或者在 barricades 后面与他们战斗。",
	"The barricades in the northwest of the hall are constructed to defend against attackers coming from the breached barracks ({@area Area 312|SC-312|x}). If the positions are flipped—trollkin on the north side, characters on the south and east—the trollkin smash the platforms before scrambling over so characters can't use them. The barricade then has the same effect against characters as usual, but the characters also have half cover against attacks from the trollkin (+2 to AC and saving throws), who lose some of their height advantage.": "大厅西北部的路障是为了防御从被攻破的兵营({@area Area 312|SC-312|x})方向袭击的敌人而建造的。如果位置颠倒——半兽人在北侧，角色在南侧和东侧——半兽人会摧毁平台，然后翻越过来，这样角色就无法使用它们。路障对抗角色的效果与通常情况下一样，但角色还可以获得半掩护来抵御来自半兽人的攻击（+2 AC和豁免），这样半兽人失去了一些高度优势。",
	"Originally this was sleeping quarters for up to fifty dwarves. The room was crowded with bunk beds, footlockers, and little else. Now half the trollkin use it as their chamber, sleeping on bunks pushed together and piled with furs. All the chests have been thoroughly looted since the dwarves were defeated, and little of value remains other than the trollkin's meager possessions.

It's on a 2-foot pedestal atop a 16-inch riser, which places the top of the anvil almost 8.5 feet above floor level. Even someone who stands on the steps around the anvil can't see the top.": "这个铁砧比任何典型的铁匠铁砧都要大得多：长7英尺，高5英尺。它位于一个2英尺高的基座上，再加上一个16英寸高的升降台，使得铁砧的顶部几乎高出地面8.5英尺。即使站在铁砧周围的台阶上，也看不到顶部。(D&D)。",
	"The inscription in {@language Dwarvish} states, \"Mighty Thor overlooks the sins of those who praise his name.\" A dwarf with the Stonecunning trait who inspects the inscription recognizes that it's more recent and less artistic than other features of the chamber. It's also an odd thing to write in a shrine to Volund, but that's not something to give away; players must realize that on their own.": "在{@language Dwarvish}的铭文中写着：“强大的索尔宽恕那些赞美他名字的人的罪孽。” 一个具有石工特质的矮人检查这个铭文时会意识到，它比房间其他特征更为近期，艺术性也较差。在沃伦神龛中写这样的话确实有些奇怪，但这并不是要透露的事情；玩家必须自己意识到这一点。",
	"The statues are also on 2-foot platforms and are 7 feet tall themselves, so they too tower over the chamber. The top of the anvil lines up approximately with their eye level.": "这些雕像也位于2英尺高的平台上，自身高7英尺，因此它们也高耸在房间之上。铁砧的顶部大约与它们的眼睛水平对齐。",
	"The statues are carved in the characteristic style of the northern dwarves. Both are portrayed in ornate plate armor. The statue to the east grips the handle of a greatsword with its tip resting on the floor, while the statue to the west grips a similarly inverted maul.": "这些雕像是以北方矮人特有的风格雕刻而成的。两尊雕像都穿着华丽的板甲。东边的雕像握着一把大剑的把手，剑尖搁在地板上，而西边的雕像则握着一把同样倒挂的大锤。",
	"The anvil is not solid gold. It's made of iron with thin gold plating. If all the gold were scraped off, it would be worth only 10 gp.": "这个铁砧并不是纯金的。它是铁制的，只是表面镀了一层薄薄的金。如果把所有金都刮掉，它只值10 gp。",
	"This chamber is a shrine to Volund (Svarog), as is obvious to any dwarves or other characters with knowledge of the deity. He is popular among smiths and other craftsmen and also with the reaver dwarves who built this complex. As the dwarves turned more and more to raiding, their worship turned more heavily to {@deity Thor|Norse|PHB}.": "这个房间是瓦伦德（斯瓦罗格）的神殿，对于任何熟悉这位神明的矮人或其他角色来说都是显而易见的。他在铁匠和其他工匠中很受欢迎，也受到建造这个复杂结构的劫掠矮人的喜爱。随着矮人们越来越倾向于掠夺，他们的崇拜也更加倾向于{@deity Thor|Norse|PHB}。",
	"An important item lies atop the anvil, where it's difficult to spot. Medium-sized characters standing on the platforms alongside the statues are about 8 feet above the floor—still below the 8.5-foot height of the top. To see the top of the anvil, someone must climb up the anvil, fly, or stand near a statue and jump up.": "在铁砧的顶部放着一件重要物品，很难被发现。站在雕像旁边的平台上的中等身材人物大约在离地面8英尺的高度——仍然低于8.5英尺高的顶部。要看到铁砧的顶部，有人必须爬上铁砧、飞起来，或者站在雕像附近然后跳起来。",
	"A tiny representation of the hammer of Thor, about 5 inches long, rests atop the anvil. It's plated in the same gold as the anvil and appears to be part of it.": "索尔之锤的微型模型，长约5英寸，静静地放在铁砧上。它镀金，与铁砧一样金光闪闪，看起来仿佛是铁砧的一部分。",
	"If the gold plating is scraped away, the hammer comes free; it's a separate piece resting in a shallow indentation in the anvil and encased in the same gold plating.": "如果镀金被刮掉，锤子就会脱落；它是一个独立的部分，靠在铁砧上的一个浅凹处，并且被相同的镀金包裹着。",
	"When the tiny hammer is picked up from the anvil, blue light swirls around the statues as they transform into two {@creature monolith footman|ToB|monolith footmen} (Tome of Beasts). These {@creature monolith footman|ToB|monolith footmen} were fashioned by elves at the request of Gerhardt III. What they do depends on what happened earlier.": "当从铁砧上拿起小锤时，蓝光围绕着雕像旋转，它们变成了两本《{@creature monolith footman|ToB|monolith footmen}野兽之书》。这些{@creature monolith footman|ToB|monolith footmen}是由精灵按照格哈特三世的要求制作的。它们的作用取决于之前发生的事情。",
	"If characters opened the shrine by operating the mechanism properly (with the statue, an ember, and a hammer) or if the character who picked up the hammer spoke Thor's name aloud and in a praiseful manner while doing so, the monolith footmen make no offensive moves.": "如果角色通过正确操作机关（使用雕像、一团余烬和一把锤子）打开神龛，或者拿起锤子的角色在这样做时大声并赞美地说出索尔（Thor）的名字，石碑步兵将不会发动攻击。",
	"If characters bypassed the door mechanism with {@item thieves' tools|PHB} and didn't praise Thor's name as they took the hammer, then the monolith footmen attack.": "如果角色用{@item thieves' tools|PHB}绕过了门机制，并在拿起锤子时没有赞美托尔的名字，那么石碑步兵会发动攻击。",
	"If characters scrape more than a few square inches of plating off the anvil, looting or defacing the shrine, the monolith footmen attack.": "如果角色刮掉了铁砧上超过几平方英寸的镀层，掠夺或破坏神龛，石碑步兵会发动攻击。",
	"If characters attack either monolith or cause damage to them, they turn hostile and attack.": "如果角色攻击（monolith）或对它们造成伤害，它们会变得敌对并发起攻击。",
	"If the monolith footmen don't attack, they stand quietly until the character with the tiny hammer leaves. The footmen follow that character. They don't leave this level and they don't protect the character; they just follow.": "如果石碑步兵不攻击，它们会静静地站在那里，直到拿着小锤子的角色离开。步兵会跟随那个角色。它们不会离开这个层级，也不会保护那个角色；它们只是跟随。",
	"The tiny hammer is the key that opens the tombs ({@area Areas 307|SC-307|x}–{@area 309|SC-309|x}). Once characters enter that area, the monolith footmen stand at the top of the stairs, blocking the doorway. For more details on their actions, see Thor's shrine ({@area Area 309|SC-309|x}). They stay there until the {@creature ring servant|CCodex} ({@area Area 309|SC-309|x}) is destroyed. The monoliths take no part in combat unless they take damage from a character.": "这把小锤子是打开陵墓({@area Areas 307|SC-307|x}–{@area 309|SC-309|x})的关键。一旦角色进入该区域，石碑步兵会站在楼梯顶部，挡住门口。有关他们行动的更多细节，请参阅索尔神龛((Thor's shrine {@area Area 309|SC-309|x}))。他们会一直待在那里，直到{@creature ring servant|CCodex} ({@area Area 309|SC-309|x})被摧毁。除非受到角色的伤害，否则石碑不参与战斗。",
	"There's nothing remarkable about this kitchen area. It's obviously well used and well taken care of. The attached room is a pantry full of preserved foods and seasonings. A narrow chute gives access to the oubliette that drops from Level 1 to Level 4. The trollkin cook uses it as a garbage chute.": "这个厨房区域没有什么特别的地方。显然它被充分使用和照顾。附属的房间是一个储藏着保鲜食品和调味品的食品室。一个狭窄的通道通往从1级到4级的地牢。巨魔族厨师把它当作垃圾通道。",
	"The dwarves used this area to house their trained dire owlbears. Those owlbears' descendants still use it as a den, but these are considerably less well trained.": "矮人们曾经利用这个区域来驯养他们的训练过的恐怖猫头鹰熊。那些猫头鹰熊的后代仍然把它当作巢穴，但它们的训练明显不如从前。",
	"As soon as you open the door, the reek of an animal den hits your nostrils. Despite how powerfully the place smells, it looks reasonably clean. The stone floor is deeply gouged by claw marks, but you see no animal droppings and only a few blood smears and crushed bones.": "当你打开门的时候，一股动物巢穴的恶臭扑面而来。尽管这个地方闻起来很刺鼻，但看起来相当干净。石地板上深深地刻着爪痕，但你看不到动物粪便，只有一些血迹和碎骨。",
	"Whether any dire owlbears remain depends on how the battle for this level unfolded. It's possible characters have already killed all of them by the time this door is opened. If that's the case, only one {@creature dire owlbear cub|KPSC} is here. It's enclosed in the larger of the two stables at the east end of the room. The cub has the stats of a {@creature brown bear|MM}.": "是否还有凶猛猫头鹰熊取决于这一层战斗的进展。可能角色们在打开这扇门时已经杀死了所有的猫头鹰熊。如果是这种情况，这里只有一个（`dire owlbear`）。它被关在房间东侧两个马厩中较大的一个里。这只幼崽的属性与（`dire owlbear`）相同。",
	"Characters might cook up various schemes to raise this cub and domesticate it. Someone with {@skill Animal Handling} proficiency, a {@class druid}, or a {@class Ranger|PHB|Beast Master ranger|Beast Master|PHB} can establish an uneasy rapport with it by making a successful {@dc 13} Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) check. The dire owlbear, however, is neither a beast nor easily domesticated. It's a feral monstrosity, and eventually (sooner rather than later) it turns and tries to tear off the hand that feeds it. Don't shy away from having this happen at the worst possible moment.": "角色可能会设计各种方案来抚养这只幼崽并驯化它。具有{@skill Animal Handling}熟练度的人，一个{@class druid}，或者一个{@class Ranger|PHB|Beast Master ranger|Beast Master|PHB}可以通过进行一次成功的{@dc 13}感知({@skill Animal Handling})检定来与它建立一种不稳定的关系。然而，凶猛猫头鹰熊既不是野兽，也不容易被驯化。它是一种野生的怪物，最终（迟早会）转身试图撕咬喂养它的人。不要在最糟糕的时刻发生这种情况。",
	"If characters haven't killed all the dire owlbears, then the surviving ones are here and they go berserk when strangers appear. Closing and even barring doors slows them down for only 2 rounds before they tear the door to splinters and come through. With a speed of 40 feet, they're considerably faster than most characters. They don't chase anyone up the spiral stairs. If they haven't caught their prey in 10 rounds, they give up and return to this den.": "如果角色们还没有杀死所有的凶猛猫头鹰熊(`dire owlbears`), 那么幸存的凶猛猫头鹰熊会在这里，当陌生人出现时它们会变得狂暴。关闭甚至用门栓堵住门只能让它们延迟2回合，然后它们就会将门撕成碎片冲过来。以40英尺的速度，它们比大多数角色要快得多。它们不会追逐任何人上螺旋楼梯。如果在10回合内它们还没有捕捉到猎物，它们会放弃并返回到它们的巢穴。",
	"As noted in the description, this chamber is relatively clean (for a stable) despite the smell, and the dire owlbears are well fed and in good health. The trollkin have long tribal knowledge of handling such creatures, and they take good care of them.": "正如描述中所指出的，尽管有气味，这个房间（（stable））相对干净，恐怖猫头鹰熊（（dire owlbears））被喂养得很好，健康状况良好。巨魔亲族（（trollkin））拥有处理这类生物的悠久部落知识，并且他们很好地照顾它们。",
	"The alcove to the north contains four auto-loading heavy crossbows trained along the gauntlet ({@area Area 310|SC-310|x}). They can be dismounted and used as normal {@item heavy crossbow|PHB|heavy crossbows}. Eighty additional {@item crossbow bolt|PHB|bolts} are also stored in boxes in that area; there are no quivers.": "北面的壁龛里放着四把自动装填的重型十字弩，对准了走廊({@area Area 310|SC-310|x})。它们可以卸下来像普通武器一样使用{@item heavy crossbow|PHB|heavy crossbows}。另外还有八十支额外的{@item crossbow bolt|PHB|bolts}存放在那个区域的箱子里；没有箭筒。",
	"In the western portion of the chamber, a hole is smashed through the floor. This opening was created by the derro living below as a shortcut to the surface after the dwarves were wiped out, allowing them to avoid a long trek on the Black River. The trollkin allowed the derro to use the tunnel on their surface raids in exchange for the derro occasionally leaving behind a weak or dying captive for the dire owlbears to kill and eat.": "在房间的西部，地板上被砸出一个洞。这个开口是由住在下面的德罗族人创造的，他们在矮人被消灭后将其作为通往地表的捷径，让他们避免在黑河上进行漫长的跋涉。巨魔允许德罗族人在地表突袭中使用这条隧道，作为交换，德罗族人偶尔会留下一个虚弱或垂死的俘虏给凶猛猫头鹰熊来杀死和吃掉。",
	"The hole drops 80 feet to the bat caverns below ({@area Area 401|SC-401|x}). It's the only way for characters to reach the lower levels (or to get out again!) until they find other means from below.": "洞口向下垂落80英尺，通往下方的蝙蝠洞穴({@area Area 401|SC-401|x})。这是角色到达下层（或再次离开！）的唯一途径，直到他们从下方找到其他方法。",
	"A rope ladder made from an unfamiliar, spongy fiber is tied to a wooden post in this chamber and hangs down the hole. A character who examines it and makes a successful {@dc 12} Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check realizes it's woven from tough, giant fungus. If any trollkin or dire owlbears survive (and some almost certainly do; see {@adventure Restocking|KPSC|6|Restocking}), this ladder might be destroyed or removed at some point when the characters return to the hole.": "在这个房间里，有一把用一种陌生、海绵状纤维制成的绳梯系在一根木柱上，从洞口垂下。任何检查并成功通过{@dc 12}智力检定({@skill Nature})的角色会意识到这是由坚韧的巨型真菌编织而成。如果有任何巨魔亲属或凶鸮幸存下来(几乎肯定会有一些；见{@adventure Restocking|KPSC|6|Restocking})，当角色们返回洞口时，这把梯子可能会被摧毁或移除。",
	"This tunnel was carved out by dwarves and dire owlbears long ago. It's dark, narrow, twisting, uneven, and nearly three-quarters of a mile long. It emerges in an overgrown jumble of boulders somewhere southeast of the ruined citadel. The dire owlbears use the tunnel to travel to and from the surface for hunting. The trollkin sometimes use it for the same reason, but the low ceiling makes it awkward for them.": "这条隧道很久以前由矮人和(恐怖猫头鹰熊)挖掘而成。它黑暗、狭窄、蜿蜒、不平整，长达将近四分之三英里。它通向一个被长满杂草的巨石混乱地带，位于废墟要塞的东南方向。恐怖猫头鹰熊利用这条隧道往返地表进行狩猎。巨魔亲缘者有时也会因为同样的原因使用它，但低矮的天花板让他们感到尴尬。",
	"When only a handful of trollkin remain, this is the most likely spot for them to make their final stand. They build a barricade around the door and fight until honor is satisfied (meaning no one flees until they're wounded). When all appears lost, having this tunnel at their backs gives them an escape route. The last few survivors do not die where they stand; one heroically remains behind to block the path while its comrades retreat up the tunnel and escape back to Jotunheim, happy to shake the dust of this cursed place off their boots and with epic tales of battle and tragedy to tell their kin.": "当只剩下少数巨魔后裔时，这很可能是它们最后的据点。它们在门口筑起一道栅栏，战斗直至荣誉得以满足（意味着没有人在受伤前逃跑）。当一切似乎已经无望时，有这条隧道在它们背后，给了它们一个逃生的路线。最后幸存的几个不会就此死去；一个英勇的巨魔后裔留下来阻挡道路，让同伴们撤退并逃回到约顿海姆，高兴地甩掉这个被诅咒的地方的尘土，并带着关于战斗和悲剧的史诗故事告诉它们的族人。",
	"A sturdy door set into the south wall of the tunnel a couple dozen paces beyond this chamber leads to {@area Area 319|SC-319|x} in the Clacking Caverns.": "在这个房间之外几十步的地方，通往（Clacking Caverns）的南墙上嵌有一扇坚固的门，通向{@area Area 319|SC-319|x}。",
	"This section of the Scarlet Citadel was carved out by the dwarves to serve as tombs for their heroes. They used a chain of natural caverns as the central core of the crypts and cut rectangular chambers to the sides. This area of the dwarven redoubt was never entered by the knights of Khors, so most of the tombs remain sealed.": "这部分猩红城堡（Scarlet Citadel）是由矮人雕刻而成，用作他们英雄的墓穴。他们利用一系列天然洞穴作为墓穴的中心核心，并在两侧开凿出长方形的房间。这部分矮人据点从未被科尔斯骑士（Knights of Khors）进入过，因此大部分墓穴仍然封闭着。",
	"The influence of the Black River is felt here, and it's worked its magic on the dead occupants of the tombs.": "这里能感受到黑河的影响，它已经对坟墓里的亡者施展了它的魔力。",
	"In addition, the disappearance of the dwarves allowed aggressive underground hunter-scavengers called clacker beetles to move into the caverns and establish a nest. Clacker beetles roam freely through the whole sub-level, with the exception of the still-sealed crypts.": "此外，矮人的消失让侵略性的地下猎食者克拉克甲虫得以进入洞穴并建立巢穴。克拉克甲虫在整个次级地下层自由漫游，唯独尚未打开的地下墓室例外。",
	"The real mystery in this area is a pair of pools that float in midair in the two largest caverns. The pools were here when the dwarves arrived, and the dwarves never figured out how these enigmas came to exist. Carnivorous fish live in the pools, making them mildly dangerous to the curious. The dwarves found the strange features both fascinating and beautiful, so they took precautions and worked around them and even used them as burial grounds—and hiding spots for valuable caches. (The nature of the floating pools is explained in the description of {@area Area 320|SC-320|x}.)": "这个地区真正的谜团是两个漂浮在两个最大洞穴中的水池。这些水池在矮人们到达时就已经存在，而矮人们从未弄清楚这些谜团是如何形成的。水池里生活着食肉鱼，使得它们对好奇的人有些危险。矮人们发现这些奇怪的特征既迷人又美丽，因此他们采取了预防措施，绕过它们甚至将它们用作埋葬地和贵重物品的藏匿地。（漂浮水池的性质在{@area Area 320|SC-320|x}的描述中有解释。）",
	"Most of this level is lightless. The exceptions are those areas where glowing moss grows: {@area Areas 319|SC-319|x}–{@area 321|SC-321|x}, {@area 325|SC-325|x}, {@area 330|SC-330|x}, and {@area 331|SC-331|x}. Glowing moss produces dim illumination throughout the chamber. Everywhere else, characters must provide their own light.": "这个层级大部分是没有光线的。唯一的例外是那些生长着发光苔藓的区域：{@area Areas 319|SC-319|x} - {@area 321|SC-321|x}，{@area 325|SC-325|x}，{@area 330|SC-330|x}，和{@area 331|SC-331|x}。发光苔藓在整个房间内产生微弱的照明。在其他地方，角色必须提供自己的光源。",
	"This level presents a slowly rising threat that suddenly explodes into deadly danger. Characters should be drawn to the potential for loot in the dwarven tombs and the mystery of the floating pools, the shrine, and the trollkin armor surrounded by charred beetles. While the characters investigate, clacker beetles are slowly but surely surrounding them and getting ready to pounce. By the time characters discover the clacker beetle nest, they should be thoroughly hemmed in. Some groups will fight their way out; others may choose to dive into whatever unknown danger lies below {@area Area 331|SC-331|x} or into the river rather than face the horde of beetles.": "这个关卡呈现出一种缓慢升级的威胁，突然爆发成致命的危险。角色应该被矮人墓穴中的战利品潜力、漂浮池塘的神秘、神龛和被烧焦甲虫包围的巨魔族装备所吸引。当角色调查时，夹击甲虫慢慢但肯定地包围着他们，并准备好发动突袭。当角色发现夹击甲虫巢穴时，他们应该被彻底围困。一些团队会与之战斗；其他人可能会选择跳入下方的未知危险{@area Area 331|SC-331|x}或跳入河中，而不是面对甲虫的大军。",
	"From the door connected to the tunnel out of the dwarven barracks ({@area Area 318|SC-318|x}), the passageway slopes downward at a rate that's obvious but gentle by dungeon standards. The floor levels out 20 feet before the bend and widening of the passage.": "从通往矮人兵营外隧道的门({@area Area 318|SC-318|x})开始，走廊以地牢标准来说是明显但温和的斜坡向下倾斜。在拐弯和走廊变宽之前的20英尺处，地面变平。",
	"The walls, floor, and ceiling of this passage show signs of careful smoothing, but it's obvious this was a natural tunnel before the dwarves went to work improving it. It's equally obvious they didn't try to erase its natural origin but only aimed to improve on it—to make the tunnel easier to traverse.": "这条通道的墙壁、地板和天花板显示出经过精心修整的痕迹，但很明显在矮人着手改进之前，这是一个自然的隧道。同样明显的是，他们并没有试图抹去它的自然起源，而只是试图改进它——让隧道更容易穿行。",
	"Past a sweeping bend in the tunnel, a soft glow illuminates a large cavern ahead. The glow comes from blue-green moss blanketing the floor and walls. The moss emits a pale light that actually twinkles weakly, almost like starlight. The glow intensifies where the moss is crushed underfoot, so you leave glowing, twinkling footsteps in your wake.": "穿过隧道中一个宽广的弯道，前方一个大洞穴被柔和的光芒照亮。光芒来自覆盖地面和墙壁的蓝绿色苔藓。苔藓散发出一种苍白的光芒，几乎像星光般微弱地闪烁。光芒在被脚踩压的地方更加明亮，所以你在走过后留下了发光、闪烁的脚印。",
	"Smoothly cut and finished passages branch off the mosscovered tunnel to your right and left.": "顺利切割并完成的通道分别向您的右侧和左侧的苔藓覆盖的隧道分岔。",
	"The glowing moss is harmless and can even be useful. Any character can figure out how to properly harvest and preserve the {@item glowing moss|KPSC} {@homebrew |(see the appendix)} with 15 minutes of study followed by a successful {@dc 18} Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check. Druids make this check with advantage.": "这种发光苔藓是无害的，甚至可以派上用场。任何角色只需花费15分钟研究，然后成功进行一次{@dc 18}智力检定({@skill Nature})，就能学会如何正确收获和保存{@item glowing moss|KPSC} {@homebrew |(see the appendix)}。德鲁伊在这次检定中获得优势。",
	"The main feature of this cavern is the pool of water floating midair and teeming with fish. If characters have already explored the adjacent mossy cavern ({@area Area 321|SC-321|x}), skip the readaloud text and simply tell players this cavern is much like that one.": "这个洞穴的主要特点是悬浮在半空中并且充满鱼群的水池。如果角色已经探索过相邻的苔藓洞穴({@area Area 321|SC-321|x})，跳过朗读文本，简单告诉玩家这个洞穴和那个很相似。",
	"The walls and floor of this cavern are covered in a thick blanket of glowing, twinkling moss. The 25-foot-high, domed ceiling is mostly bare except for a few scattered, softly glowing spots. But the moss isn't the arresting sight here.": "这个洞穴的墙壁和地板覆盖着一层厚厚的发光、闪烁的苔藓。25英尺高的圆顶天花板大部分是光秃秃的，只有几处散发着柔和光芒的斑点。但这里最引人注目的并不是苔藓。",
	"Near the center of the cavern, an immense blob of water floats in midair.": "在洞穴中心附近，一团巨大的水块悬浮在半空中。",
	"The blob is about 12 feet in diameter, is irregular in shape, and undulates slowly. The liquid is dark and somewhat obscured by reflections of the twinkling moss light, but you catch occasional glimpses that might be things swimming in it.": "这个（`blob`）大约有12英尺直径，形状不规则，缓慢地起伏。液体很暗，有些被闪烁的苔藓光线遮挡，但你偶尔能看到一些可能在其中游动的东西。",
	"As unusual as this pool and the one in {@area Area 321|SC-321|x} appear, reality is even stranger than appearance. The pools aren't self-contained globs of water floating in midair. They're spots where a wrinkle in space-time induced by the Black River allows reality to intersect itself so two locations exist in the same space. In this case, the second location is a distant, tropical sea teeming with quippers. For example, if a character extends their hand into one of the pools, their hand exists simultaneously here beneath the Scarlet Citadel and in that tropical sea hundreds of miles away. There's always only one hand, but it occupies two coinciding spaces at the same time.": "就像{@area Area 321|SC-321|x}中的那个池塘一样，这个池塘也是异常的，但现实比外表更奇怪。这些池塘不是漂浮在半空中的自包含水块。它们是时空中的一个皱褶，由黑河引起，使现实相交，使两个地点存在于同一空间中。在这种情况下，第二个地点是一个遥远的热带海域，到处都是鳄鱼。例如，如果一个角色把手伸入其中一个池塘，他们的手同时存在于这里的绯红城堡下方，以及数百英里之外的热带海域中。永远只有一只手，但它同时占据着两个重叠的空间。",
	"Characters might get a glimmer of this truth if they study the phenomenon. First, within moments of approaching the pool, characters notice dead fish lying among the moss under and around the pool. These fall into two categories: freshly dead fish (no more than a day old) and clean, scattered bones (that's all the clacker beetles leave behind). Anyone with {@skill Nature} proficiency recognizes most of the fish as {@creature quipper|MM|quippers} but an unfamiliar variety they've never seen in this part of the world.": "如果角色研究这一现象，他们可能会对这个真相有所领悟。首先，在接近池塘的瞬间，角色们会注意到死鱼散落在池塘下面和周围的苔藓中。这些死鱼可以分为两类：新鲜死去的鱼（不超过一天）和干净的散落骨头（这是所有的夹击甲虫留下的）。任何具有{@skill Nature}熟练度的人都会认出大部分鱼是{@creature quipper|MM|quippers}，但也有一种他们在这个世界的这一部分从未见过的陌生品种。",
	"Someone who observes the pool for at least 10 minutes and makes a successful {@dc 12} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check notices fish in the pool sometimes swim across the pool's boundary and simply disappear. Other times, a fish or other sea creature (a squid, shark, or turtle for example) enters the pool the same way. The fish entering and leaving the pool must come from somewhere and go somewhere, and one logical assumption (though not the only one, in a magical world) is that via some mysterious mechanism, the water the characters see is part of a larger body of water the characters can't see.": "当有人观察游泳池至少10分钟并成功进行一次{@dc 12}智力({@skill Investigation})检定时，他会注意到游泳池中的鱼有时会横穿游泳池的边界，然后神秘地消失。其他时候，一条鱼或其他海洋生物（比如乌贼、鲨鱼或海龟）也会以同样的方式进入游泳池。进入和离开游泳池的鱼必须来自某个地方并去往另一个地方，一个合乎逻辑的假设（尽管在一个魔法世界里不是唯一的假设）是，通过某种神秘的机制，角色们看到的水是一个更大水体的一部分，而这个水体是角色们看不见的。",
	"Alternatively, you can declare that at some point while characters are in this chamber or {@area Area 321|SC-321|x}, a fish swims out of the pool and drops to the floor, where it flops around gasping for air.": "或者，你可以宣布在角色们在这个房间或{@area Area 321|SC-321|x}时，一条鱼游出水池，掉到地板上，挣扎着喘气。",
	"Characters can gain another clue by crawling under the pool and looking up through it. They see what appears to be sunlight (if it's daytime) dappled across the surface of water far above them. They're seeing the surface of the distant sea. This is dangerously deceptive; the pool is 300 feet below the surface of the sea.": "角色可以通过爬到池塘下面，向上看，获得另一个线索。他们看到似乎是阳光（如果是白天的话）洒在远处水面上。他们看到的是遥远海面的表面。这是非常具有欺骗性的；池塘在海面下方300英尺处。",
	"An important feature is mounted to the ceiling of the cavern directly above the pool: a bronze pulley. The bronze has darkened to nearly the same color as the stone, and its position above the pool makes it difficult to spot. A successful {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check is needed to notice it. Reaching the pulley is a challenge, since it's 25 feet above the cavern floor and directly over the pool.": "一个重要的特征被安装在洞穴天花板正上方的位置：一个青铜滑轮。青铜已经变得几乎和石头一样的颜色，它在池子正上方的位置使得它很难被发现。需要成功的{@dc 15}感知({@skill Perception})检定才能注意到它。到达这个滑轮是一个挑战，因为它离洞穴地面25英尺高，正好在池子上方。",
	"Characters can jump into these pools and swim into that southern sea, but it's a daunting proposition indeed.": "角色可以跳进这些水池，游向那个南海，但这确实是一个令人畏惧的提议。",
	"The first problem is the depth. As soon as a character enters the water, they're aware of the crushing pressure. A character who enters the pool bodily must immediately make a successful {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw just to hold his or her breath. If that saving throw fails, all the air is squeezed from their lungs and they must either swim out of the pool or begin suffocating.": "第一个问题是深度。一旦角色进入水中，他们就会意识到巨大的压力。一个角色如果全身进入水池，必须立即进行一次成功的{@dc 15}体质豁免才能屏住呼吸。如果豁免失败，他们的肺部将被挤压，必须要么游出水池，要么开始窒息。",
	"The second problem is predators. Not everything in that sea is dangerous but {@creature reef shark|MM|reef sharks}, {@creature giant shark|MM|giant sharks}, and {@creature swarm of quippers|MM|quipper swarms} abound, along with any other sea creatures you add to the mix. Anyone who enters the sea should have to fight at least one hungry predator. If that fight leaves them bleeding, more predators appear.": "第二个问题是掠食者。那片海域并非所有生物都危险，但{@creature reef shark|MM|reef sharks}、{@creature giant shark|MM|giant sharks}和{@creature swarm of quippers|MM|quipper swarms}比比皆是，还有你添加进来的其他海洋生物。任何进入海域的人都应该至少要与一只饥饿的掠食者战斗。如果那场战斗让他们受伤流血，更多的掠食者会出现。",
	"The final problem is finding their way back to the Scarlet Citadel. A character who stays in the portion of the pool that overlaps the Scarlet Citadel can return to this chamber automatically. A character who swims away into the sea can easily lose sight of the small spot where the sea and this mossy cavern overlap. A creature within 30 feet of the pool can spot it with a successful {@dc 10} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. From 31 to 60 feet away, the DC increases to 15; from 61 to 90 feet, the DC is 20; and so on. If a {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light} is shining into the pool from this chamber, the DC is reduced by 5.": "最终的问题是找到回到绯红城堡的路。待在与绯红城堡重叠的池塘部分的角色可以自动返回这个房间。游向大海的角色很容易失去海洋和这个苔藓洞穴重叠的小区域的视线。在池塘范围内的生物可以通过成功的{@dc 10}智慧检定({@skill Perception})发现它。从31到60英尺以外，DC增加到15；从61到90英尺，DC为20；依此类推。如果有{@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light}从这个房间照射到池塘中，DC减少5。",
	"While in the pool, a creature sees both the mossy cavern and the surrounding sea overlapped in a confusing jumble. By {@status concentration||concentrating} on one or the other, a creature can see the chosen scene more clearly. The effort is similar to trying to focus your eyes on a 3D photograph: hard to explain but not terribly difficult to do once you get the hang of it.": "在游泳池中，一只生物看到苔藓洞穴和周围的海洋重叠在一起，令人困惑。通过{@status concentration||concentrating}在其中一个上，生物可以更清楚地看到所选择的场景。这种努力类似于试图聚焦眼睛在一个3D照片上：很难解释，但一旦掌握了技巧，做起来并不是太困难。",
	"The pool is 300 feet from the sea's surface and 200 feet above the sea floor. The bottom can be seen by someone who's inside the pool bodily or even someone who sticks only their head into the water. The sea bed is covered by stones, gravel, and sand, being too far down for most kelp and coral.": "游泳池距离海面300英尺，高出海底200英尺。在池子里的人甚至是只把头伸进水里的人都能看到池底。海床上覆盖着石头、砾石和沙子，对于大多数海带和珊瑚来说太深了。",
	"The dwarves recognized this was a great security measure for objects they wanted to keep safe. A character who scans the sea bed from the floating pool and makes a successful {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check spots something that looks different from the surrounding stones and with an unnaturally regular shape.": "矮人们意识到这是一个保护他们想要保护的物品的重要安全措施。一个角色在浮动的池塘中扫描海床，并成功进行了一次 {@dc 15} 智慧 ({@skill Perception}) 检定，发现了一些看起来与周围的石头不同，并且形状异常规则的东西。",
	"The object is a bronze cylinder decorated to resemble a large, thick, squarish fish. It's 50 inches long, 18 inches in diameter, and weighs 220 pounds. Because this is heroic fantasy, we assume a character who's brave enough to swim down to the cylinder can lift it and even carry it while swimming, albeit clumsily. Creatures without a swimming speed move at half speed in water, and carrying this cylinder halves a creature's speed again. To retrieve the cylinder, a character with a speed 30 feet swimming as fast as possible (using {@action Dash} actions) needs about 45 seconds (7 turns) to swim down to the sea bed, a few seconds (1 turn) to retrieve the cylinder, and another 90 seconds (14 turns) to swim back up to the mossy cavern (assuming they can find it). That's between 2 and 3 minutes in the water. Strong characters can hold their breath for that long without difficulty, provided they don't run into complications such as being attacked by sharks or getting lost in the dark water. We recommend against adding {@skill Athletics} checks (for swimming) or Constitution saving throws (for holding your breath) to this attempt because they only turn it into a dice-rolling exercise. Sea predators and the threat of getting lost are enough danger, and they're more interesting.": "这个物体是一个铜制圆柱，装饰成一个大而厚实、略呈方形的鱼的样子。它长50英寸，直径18英寸，重220磅。因为这是英雄奇幻，我们假设一个足够勇敢的角色可以游到圆柱下面并把它举起，甚至在游泳时携带，尽管会有些笨拙。没有游泳速度的生物在水中移动速度减半，携带这个圆柱会再次减半生物的速度。为了取回这个圆柱，一个游泳速度为30英尺的角色尽可能快地游动（使用{@action Dash}动作）需要大约45秒（7回合）游到海床，几秒钟（1回合）取回圆柱，然后再用90秒钟（14回合）游回到苔藓洞穴（假设他们能找到）。这在水中大约是2到3分钟。强壮的角色可以轻松地屏住呼吸那么长时间，前提是他们不会遇到诸如被鲨鱼袭击或在黑暗水域迷路等问题。我们建议不要在这次尝试中添加{@skill Athletics}检定（用于游泳）或体质豁免才智（用于屏住呼吸），因为这只会将其变成一个掷骰子的练习。海洋掠食者和迷失的威胁已经足够危险，而且更有趣。",
	"Characters might want to tie a rope around the cylinder and raise it that way instead of carrying it. This won't work unless the rope can be pulled straight up by someone suspended above the pool—or is threaded through the bronze pulley attached to the ceiling. The pool is a dimensional wrinkle in space, not a hole in the floor. If the rope is pulled sideways, it simply falls out of the water onto the floor and the bottom 200 feet of it are sliced off by a sharp paradox. The pulley was the dwarves' answer to this problem, and it works like a charm.": "角色们可能想要在圆柱体周围绑绳子，然后通过这种方式将其升起，而不是搬运它。除非绳子可以被悬挂在水池上方的人直接向上拉起，或者通过连接到天花板的青铜滑轮穿过。这个水池是空间中的一个维度扭曲，而不是地板上的一个洞。如果绳子被横向拉动，它会简单地从水中掉到地板上，底部200英尺的绳子会被一个尖锐的悖论切断。滑轮是矮人们对这个问题的解决方案，而且它运作得非常好。",
	"The dwarves made a special bronze hook (which can be found in the fountain in {@area Area 327|SC-327|x}) that's magically paired with the bronze cylinder. When the hook is lowered to the cylinder, it automatically catches in the fish's open mouth so the cylinder can be hauled up with a rope. The hook trick isn't apparent until characters see the bronze hook and someone gets a close look at the container.": "矮人们制作了一个特殊的青铜钩（可以在喷泉中找到{@area Area 327|SC-327|x}），它与青铜圆柱体进行了魔法配对。当钩子被放下到圆柱体时，它会自动钩住鱼嘴张开的地方，这样就可以用绳子把圆柱体拉起来。直到角色们看到青铜钩并有人仔细观察容器时，这个钩子的技巧才会显现出来。",
	"In reverse, the cylinder wasn't lowered into the sea, it was just dropped into the pool to sink under its own weight.": "相反地，气缸并没有被降到海里，而只是被放入泳池中，靠自身重量下沉。",
	"See {@adventure Treasure|KPSC|6|Treasure|3} for details on how to open the cylinder and on its contents.": "请查看{@adventure Treasure|KPSC|6|Treasure|3}，了解如何打开气缸以及其中的内容。",
	"Assuming characters enter this chamber before entering {@area Area 321|SC-321|x}, they aren't attacked by clacker beetles here. If they explore {@area Area 321|SC-321|x} first, then the attack described in that chamber occurs here instead.": "假设角色在进入{@area Area 321|SC-321|x}之前进入这个房间，它们不会在这里受到攻击。如果他们先探索{@area Area 321|SC-321|x}，那么描述在那个房间中发生的攻击会在这里发生。",
	"The fish-cylinder is hollow, as anyone who taps on it quickly discovers. It has no apparent means of opening such as a screwed-in plug or a clamped-down hatch. A few minutes of close examination and a successful {@dc 13} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check reveals a narrow, mud-clogged slot along the fish's belly. This slot is just wide enough for a knife edge to grip, and that's what's required; if a knife is dragged along the slot as if cutting the fish open, the cylinder splits apart into left and right halves that are joined by a concealed dorsal hinge.": "这个鱼形圆柱是空心的，任何敲击它的人都会很快发现。它没有明显的打开方式，比如螺纹塞或夹紧的舱口。仔细观察几分钟并成功通过一次{@dc 13}智力({@skill Investigation})检定，会发现鱼腹部有一个狭窄、被泥巴堵塞的槽。这个槽只够宽以供刀刃握住，而这正是所需的；如果像切开鱼一样沿着槽拉动刀刃，圆柱就会分裂成左右两半，它们由一个隐藏的背脊铰链连接在一起。",
	"Inside the cylinder are a leather pouch containing a diamond and two emeralds (5,000 gp, 1,000 gp × 2) and a 5-inch-diameter golden disk embossed with a {@language Dwarvish} rune that means \"safe entrance.\" A character carrying this disk can unlock the doors to the tombs on this level automatically and can open them safely without setting off any {@spell glyph of warding}.": "圆筒内有一个皮袋，里面装着一颗钻石和两颗翡翠（5,000 gp，1,000 gp × 2），还有一个直径5英寸的金色圆盘，上面有一个{@language Dwarvish}符文，意为“安全入口”。携带这个圆盘的角色可以自动解锁本层墓室的门，并可以安全地打开它们，而不会触发任何{@spell glyph of warding}。",
	"The main feature of this cavern is the pool of water floating midair and teeming with fish. If characters have already explored the adjacent mossy cavern ({@area Area 320|SC-320|x}), skip the read-aloud text and simply tell players this cavern is much like that one.": "这个洞穴的主要特点是悬浮在半空中并且充满鱼群的水池。如果角色已经探索过相邻的苔藓洞穴({@area Area 320|SC-320|x})，跳过朗读文本，简单告诉玩家这个洞穴和那个很相似。",
	"The blob is 12 to 15 feet in diameter, is irregular in shape, and undulates slowly. The liquid is black and further obscured by reflections of the twinkling moss light.": "这个（Blob）直径为12到15英尺，形状不规则，缓慢地起伏。液体是黑色的，并被闪烁的苔藓光线反射进一步遮挡。",
	"See the description of {@area Area 320|SC-320|x} for a full explanation of the wrinkle-in-reality nature of the pool. Both pools result from the same phenomenon.": "请查看{@area Area 320|SC-320|x}的描述，了解池塘中扭曲现实本质的完整解释。这两个池塘都是由同一现象造成的。",
	"Both wrinkles do not, however, overlap the same region of sea. The pool in Area 320 intersects a warm tropical sea that's deep but not too deep for characters to swim in. This pool is an intersection with the depths of an icy northern sea, which makes it considerably more dangerous.": "然而，这两个褶皱并不重叠在同一个海域。在区域320的池塘与一个温暖的热带海洋相交，深度适中，足够角色们游泳。这个池塘与北部冰冷海域的深度相交，使其变得更加危险。",
	"The first danger is pressure. At the bottom of the pool in {@area Area 320|SC-320|x}, 500 feet below the surface of the sea, a character was under about 15 atmospheres of pressure. Here, a character who enters the pool is crushed by 200 atmospheres of pressure, caused by the depth of more than 6,500 feet. This immediately inflicts 27 ({@damage 6d8}) bludgeoning damage to a character sticking a head, chest, or entire body into the pool, or 9 ({@damage 2d8}) to an arm or leg. Fresh damage is caused every time the character starts its turn in the water.": "第一个危险是压力。在海面以下500英尺的{@area Area 320|SC-320|x}池底，角色承受着约15个大气压的压力。在这里，进入池中的角色将受到超过6,500英尺深度造成的200个大气压的压力，立即对将头、胸部或整个身体浸入水中的角色造成27 ({@damage 6d8}) 钝击伤害，对一只手或一条腿造成9 ({@damage 2d8}) 伤害。每当角色在水中开始其回合时都会造成新的伤害。",
	"The second danger is cold. The water is barely above freezing. Compared to the risk from pressure, this danger is almost negligible. The character takes no cold damage just from poking a hand or other appendage into the water but takes 2 ({@damage 1d4}) cold damage every time it starts its turn more than half immersed in the water. Warm clothes don't help; they just get soaked with freezing water.": "第二个危险是寒冷。水温几乎只比冰点高一点。与来自压力的风险相比，这种危险几乎可以忽略不计。角色仅仅是把手或其他肢体伸入水中并不会受到寒冷伤害，但每当它开始回合时身体超过一半浸入水中，就会受到2 ({@damage 1d4}) 点寒冷伤害。保暖衣服也无济于事；它们只会被冰冷的水浸湿。",
	"The sea floor is 800 feet below this floating pool. There's no light at this depth, so it's impossible to see what's down there from the cavern (or even how far away the bottom is) and impossible to explore firsthand without a considerable amount of magical protection the characters almost certainly don't have. As in {@area Area 320|SC-320|x}, however, there is a bronze pulley affixed to the cavern ceiling above the pool and another fish-shaped bronze cylinder lying on the sea bed. If characters have the magical fishhook and 800 feet of rope, they can retrieve the cylinder. Its contents are described in the {@adventure Treasure|KPSC|6|Treasure|4} section.": "这个漂浮的池塘下面有800英尺深的海底。在这个深度没有光线，所以从洞穴里无法看到下面的情况（甚至不知道底部有多远），也不可能亲自探索，除非角色们有相当多的魔法保护，而他们几乎肯定没有。然而，和{@area Area 320|SC-320|x}一样，洞穴天花板上有一个铜滑轮，悬挂在池塘上方，海底还有另一个鱼形铜筒。如果角色们有魔法鱼钩和800英尺的绳子，他们就可以取回这个筒子。其内容在{@adventure Treasure|KPSC|6|Treasure|4}部分有描述。",
	"Before getting to that point, however, characters must deal with a surprise, because the cylinder doesn't come up alone. A {@creature giant octopus|MM} hitches a ride on it. If the characters pulling up this cylinder are the same ones who pulled up the other cylinders, they notice quickly that this object is heavier than the other one, but they have no way of knowing why until they get it to the cavern.": "在达到那一点之前，角色们必须处理一个意外，因为气缸并不是独自上来的。一个{@creature giant octopus|MM}搭了顺风车。如果拉起这个气缸的角色和拉起其他气缸的是同一个人，他们很快就会注意到这个物体比另一个重，但在把它带到洞穴之前，他们不知道原因。",
	"When the cylinder reaches the floating pool, the octopus strikes. Characters can't see the creature clearly because it's obscured in the dark water; increase the octopus's AC by 5 to 16. Also, the octopus stays at the dead center of the pool (you should always feel free to treat the grid printed on the map as a measuring convenience, not a positioning restriction) and uses its 15-foot reach to its advantage. Characters whose melee weapons have only a 5-foot reach can't attack the octopus at all without sticking at least their arms into the crushing water. If a character is {@condition grappled} at the start of the octopus's turn, the octopus tries to pull that character into the water. Resolve this like a shoving contest, with opposed Strength ({@skill Athletics}) checks.": "当圆筒到达漂浮的池塘时，章鱼发动了攻击。角色们无法清楚地看到这个生物，因为它被黑暗的水域所遮挡；将章鱼的AC增加5点至16点。此外，章鱼停留在池塘的正中央（你应该随时可以将地图上印刷的网格视为便于测量的工具，而不是位置限制），并利用其15英尺的触角优势。只有近战武器射程为5英尺的角色，如果不至少将手臂伸入湍急的水中，就无法攻击章鱼。如果一个角色在章鱼的回合开始时处于{@condition grappled}状态，章鱼会试图将该角色拖入水中。解决这个问题就像进行推挤比赛一样，进行对抗性的力量检定（{@skill Athletics}）。",
	"The quickest and safest way for characters to kill the octopus is to lift the cylinder fully out of the pool into the cavern. The sudden, massive drop in pressure inflicts 27 ({@damage 6d8}) force damage to the octopus every time it's out of the water at the start of its turn. If it survives the first burst of this damage, it does its best to escape back into the pool as quickly as possible and return to the safety of the lightless, frigid deep.": "角色们最快、最安全地杀死章鱼的方法是将气缸完全从池中提起到洞穴中。每当章鱼在其回合开始时离开水面，突然的压力骤降会对其造成27{@damage 6d8}力量伤害。如果它在第一次受到这种伤害的冲击后幸存下来，它会尽最大努力尽快逃回池中，返回到没有光线、寒冷深渊的安全地带。",
	"At some time while characters are exploring this chamber, they're attacked by clacker beetles. The attacking group contains one {@creature clacker beetle soldier|KPSC} per character in the party. The purpose of this fight is to make characters aware of the beetles and the threat they pose.": "在角色探索这个房间的过程中，他们会遭遇到攻击性的夹击甲虫。攻击的数量为队伍中每个角色一个{@creature clacker beetle soldier|KPSC}。这场战斗的目的是让角色意识到这些甲虫以及它们构成的威胁。",

	"The {@creature clockwork myrmidon|KPSC} bursts out of its sarcophagus and attacks if the mechanist's sarcophagus is opened. If the myrmidon's sarcophagus is opened first, the myrmidon remains inert until it's attacked or damaged. A character who presses an ear against the construct and makes a successful {@dc 10} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check hears a faint ticking inside it. Any damage activates the myrmidon, even just a scratch on its enameled surface. Assume the myrmidon's initiative result is 22 when it attacks; characters aren't surprised (adventurers always expect things to burst from coffins) but only alert characters should beat it to the punch. Against a mixed party, the myrmidon ignores dwarves until they attack it. After that, it attacks everyone freely.": "当机械师的石棺被打开时，{@creature clockwork myrmidon|KPSC} 会突然冲出并发动攻击。如果先打开了冥卫的石棺，那么冥卫会保持静止，直到被攻击或受到伤害。一个角色将耳朵贴在这个构造物上，并成功进行了{@dc 10} 智慧 ({@skill Perception}) 检定，会听到里面微弱的滴答声。任何伤害都会激活冥卫，即使只是在其瓷面上留下一道划痕。假设冥卫在发动攻击时的先攻结果是22；角色不会感到惊讶（冒险者总是预料到东西会从棺材里冲出来），但只有警觉的角色才能比它更快地做出反应。在混合队伍中，冥卫会无视矮人，直到他们攻击它为止。之后，它会自由地攻击所有人。",

	"This cavern is blanketed in the hollowed-out, blackened husks of dead giant beetles. There are hundreds of them, maybe thousands. They're heaped more than a foot deep across the cavern floor. The shells are cracked and charred from intense heat, and the creatures must have been blown to bits; none of the remains you see are intact. The walls of the chamber are also charred, and you can still see the pale outlines where beetles clung to the stone when the flames struck.": "这个洞穴被死去的巨型甲虫的空心、烧焦的外壳所覆盖。它们有成百上千只，也许有数千只。它们堆积在洞穴地面上超过一英尺深。这些外壳由于强烈的热量而裂开和烧焦，这些生物一定被炸成碎片了；你看到的遗骸没有一个是完整的。洞穴的墙壁也被烧焦了，你仍然可以看到淡淡的轮廓，那是甲虫在火焰袭击时紧贴石头的痕迹。",
	"In the middle of the cavern lies a suit of plate armor. It's too large for most humanoids. Whoever wore it was nearly 8 feet tall. A representation of a skeleton is painted ornately on the armor in luminescent pigment that glows under your lights. Whoever wore this armor would have looked like a glowing skeleton advancing out of the darkness.": "在洞穴的中央放着一套板甲。对大多数人形生物来说太大了。穿戴者几乎有8英尺高。一副骷髅的图案被精美地绘制在盔甲上，使用发光颜料，在你的灯光下发出微光。穿戴这套盔甲的人看起来就像是一个从黑暗中走出来的发光骷髅。",
	"All that remains inside the armor is the skeleton of the trollkin explorer. She was a hero of the clan living in the dwarven barracks who entered these caves to explore. Clacker beetles swarmed her at this spot, and she set off a {@spell fireball} spell from a scroll. Unknown to her, the spell on the scroll was written at 9th level. The blast killed everything in the chamber, including the trollkin. Subsequently, her bones were picked clean inside the armor by other clacker beetles.": "盔甲里只剩下了巨魔子探险家的骨架。她是矮人兵营里的一位英雄，进入这些洞穴进行探险。在这个地方，夹击甲虫群袭击了她，她从一张{@spell fireball}卷轴上释放了一个法术。她并不知道，卷轴上的法术是以第9级写成的。爆炸将房间里的一切都杀死了，包括巨魔子。随后，她的骨骼被其他夹击甲虫在盔甲里啃得干干净净。",
	"As characters advance into the chamber, they're attacked by {@creature clacker beetle soldier|KPSC|clacker beetle soldiers} and {@creature clacker beetle swarm|KPSC|clacker beetle swarms} that push their way up from under the charred husks all over the chamber. The attacking force of beetles includes one soldier for every character in the party, plus half that number of swarms. These beetles emerge from under the husks, attack, then crawl back under the husks where they have complete concealment. They disappear into the piles of husks so quickly that only creatures with Dexterity scores of 16 or higher can make {@action oppourtunity attack|PHB|opportunity attacks} against them as they retreat.": "当角色们进入房间时，他们受到来自烧焦外壳下方的{@creature clacker beetle soldier|KPSC|clacker beetle soldiers}和{@creature clacker beetle swarm|KPSC|clacker beetle swarms}的袭击。这些甲虫的攻击力量包括每个角色一名士兵，以及半数蜂群。这些甲虫从外壳下方出现，发动攻击，然后爬回到外壳下完全隐蔽的地方。它们迅速消失在外壳堆中，只有敏捷得分达到16或更高的生物才能对它们进行{@action oppourtunity attack|PHB|opportunity attacks}，当它们撤退时。",
	"The trollkin armor can't be worn by anyone under 8 feet tall. Because it's unique, it could fetch up to 2,000 gp from a collector, but a typical merchant or armorer offers only half that. If characters dig through the beetle husks near the armor, they also find a {@item warhammer|PHB}, a {@item heavy crossbow|PHB} that needs a new bowstring, fourteen steel {@item crossbow bolt|PHB|bolts}, a {@item handaxe|PHB}, a {@item shield|PHB}, three {@item dagger|PHB|daggers}, and a {@item potion of fire giant strength} buried among the beetle husks.": "巨魔族护甲不能被任何身高低于8英尺的人穿戴。由于它独一无二，可能会在收藏家那里卖到高达2,000金币，但一般的商人或铁匠只会出一半的价格。如果角色在护甲附近挖掘甲虫的外壳，他们还会找到一个{@item warhammer|PHB}，一个{@item heavy crossbow|PHB} 需要新的弓弦，十四个钢制{@item crossbow bolt|PHB|bolts}，一个{@item handaxe|PHB}，一个{@item shield|PHB}，三个{@item dagger|PHB|daggers}，和一个{@item potion of fire giant strength} 埋藏在甲虫的外壳中。",
	"The door to this tomb from {@area Area 327|SC-327|x} is riveted iron with silver inlays. The inlays depict what appear to be leering demonic faces, but they're not identifiable by the characters as any specific beings.": "这座墓室从{@area Area 327|SC-327|x}通往的门是用铆铁制成的，上面镶嵌着银饰。银饰上描绘着看似嘲笑的恶魔面孔，但角色们无法辨认出它们是任何特定的存在。",
	"The door is locked. It can be opened with a successful {@dc 15} Dexterity ({@item Thieves' Tools|PHB}) check. It is also trapped with explosive runes ({@spell glyph of warding}) that cause 22 ({@damage 5d8}) cold damage to all creatures outside the tomb and within 20 feet of the door, or half damage to creatures that make a successful {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw.": "门被锁住了。要打开它需要成功进行一次敏捷度检定{@dc 15}({@item Thieves' Tools|PHB})。门上还设置了爆炸符文陷阱({@spell glyph of warding})，对坟墓外和门口20英尺范围内的所有生物造成22({@damage 5d8})点冰冷伤害，或者对进行成功的敏捷度豁免检定{@dc 15}的生物造成一半伤害。",
	"Characters who approach from {@area Area 325|SC-325|x} instead of from {@area 327|SC-327|x} don't encounter a door. Opening the door from inside the chamber doesn't trigger the {@spell glyph of warding}.": "从{@area Area 325|SC-325|x}而不是从{@area 327|SC-327|x}接近的角色不会遇到一扇门。从房间内打开门不会触发{@spell glyph of warding}。",
	"Three stone coffins are arrayed against the wall opposite the door. They're decorated with silver-inlaid depictions of hideous faces that may represent demons or devils, but they don't fall neatly into the canon of any cults you're aware of. A narrow tunnel has been clawed roughly through one wall of the room, and several sealed clay jars are stacked in the corners.": "门对面的墙上摆放着三口石棺。它们装饰着镶有银的丑陋面孔图案，可能代表恶魔或魔鬼，但并不完全符合你所知道的任何邪教规范。房间的一面墙上粗糙地挖出了一条狭窄的隧道，几个密封的粘土罐堆放在角落里。",
	"The three dwarves interred here were all warlocks who were bound in a pact with the same fiend. The leering faces etched in silver across the door and the coffins all represent this fiend. They appear to represent many different fiends, but deception and disguise are part of this fiend's portfolio. This particular cult of warlocks is highly secretive, so characters have no chance to identify the symbols unless there's a dwarf warlock among the group; a dwarf warlock recognizes the cult's insignia with a successful {@dc 13} Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) or Intelligence ({@skill History}) check. In that event, tell the player this crypt is the work of a cult dedicated to trickery and guile. Otherwise, characters are in the dark.": "这里安葬的三个矮人都是与同一恶魔签订契约的术士。门上和棺材上刻着的嘲笑面孔都代表着这个恶魔。它们看起来像是许多不同的恶魔，但欺骗和伪装是这个恶魔的专长。这个术士邪教非常隐秘，所以角色们除非有矮人术士在其中；否则无法识别这些符号，除非有成功的{@dc 13}智力检定({@skill Arcana})或智力检定({@skill History})。在这种情况下，告诉玩家这个地下室是一个致力于欺诈和狡诈的邪教的作品。否则，角色们会一无所知。",
	"All three coffins hold the bodies of dwarves in similar condition: mummified, dressed in rich (but now badly deteriorated) robes, wearing minor items of jewelry worth {@dice 2d100} gp each, and clasping a wand in their folded hands. Of more immediate interest to characters may be the fact that all three bodies are also decapitated. The heads are in the coffins, arranged carefully so it isn't obvious to a casual observer that they're not attached at the necks. If the bodies are disturbed—to get at the jewelry, for example— the separation of head from body becomes apparent.": "所有三个棺材里都放着矮人的尸体，状态相似：干尸，穿着豪华（但现在严重破损）的长袍，佩戴价值{@dice 2d100} gp的小饰品，双手合拢握着一根魔杖。对角色更直接的吸引可能是这三具尸体都被斩首。头颅在棺材里，被精心摆放以便让不经意的观察者看不出它们并未与脖子相连。如果尸体被打扰——比如为了取饰品——头颅与身体的分离就会显现出来。",
	"All three coffins indicate the presence of magic with a {@spell detect magic} spell. This is a trick. The wands clutched by the mummies are affected by permanent versions of the {@spell Nystul's Magic Aura|PHB|magic aura} spell that make them reveal evocation magic, but the wands are simply decoys and do nothing.": "所有三个棺材都显示出了一个{@spell detect magic}法术的存在。这是一个诡计。木乃伊们抓着的魔杖受到了{@spell Nystul's Magic Aura|PHB|magic aura}法术的永久版本的影响，使它们显现出唤醒魔法，但这些魔杖只是幌子，什么都不做。",
	"Nothing unusual happens until all three coffins have been opened. As soon as the third lid is removed, the three bodies animate as {@creature warlock wight|KPSC|warlock wights} {@homebrew |(see the appendix)} and attack.": "直到三个棺材都被打开，什么特别的事情都没有发生。当第三个盖子被移开时，三具尸体以 {@creature warlock wight|KPSC|warlock wights} {@homebrew |(see the appendix)} 的形式复活并发动攻击。",
	"The passage between this chamber and {@area Area 330|SC-330|x} was created by clacker beetles. It's a tunnel 3 to 4 feet in diameter, not a corridor. Halflings and gnomes can walk through it if they crouch; Medium creatures must get down on their hands and knees.": "这个房间和{@area Area 330|SC-330|x}之间的通道是由啪嗒虫创造的。这是一个直径3到4英尺的隧道，而不是走廊。半身人和地精可以蹲着走过去；中等身材的生物必须跪下来。",
	"Aside from the minor jewelry noted on the bodies of the three {@creature warlock wight|KPSC|warlock wights} ({@dice 6d100} gp total value), the only other treasure in the chamber is held in the clay jars. The jars are sealed with stretched parchment liberally covered in hard wax. They can be opened only by cracking the wax and cutting the parchment or by smashing the jar. They contain normal grave goods: household items, brushes, mirrors, daggers, decorative pins, and simple jewelry worth a total of 1,800 gp. They also contain an assortment of notes and other arcane writings that reveal the nature of the dwarves' warlock pact to anyone who can read {@language Dwarvish}, has proficiency in {@skill Arcana}, and spends an hour poring over the material.": "除了三具尸体上注明的轻微珠宝（总价值{@dice 6d100} gp），室内唯一的其他财宝存放在陶罐中。这些罐子用覆盖着硬蜡的伸展羊皮密封。只能通过破裂蜡和切割羊皮或者粉碎罐子来打开。它们包含普通的丧葬品：家居用品、刷子、镜子、匕首、装饰别针和价值总计1,800 gp的简单珠宝。它们还包含一系列笔记和其他奥秘文献，揭示了矮人们与术士契约的本质，只有能阅读{@language Dwarvish}、精通{@skill Arcana}并花费一个小时研究这些材料的人才能了解。",
	"This decorative fountain is magical, but the magic serves only to keep fresh water flowing into it, much like a {@item decanter of endless water|DMG}. The fountain doesn't overflow because channels under the floor allow excess water to drain into the river.": "这座装饰性喷泉是神奇的，但这种魔法只是用来保持新鲜水源源不断地流入其中，就像一个{@item decanter of endless water|DMG}一样。喷泉不会溢出，因为地板下的水道允许多余的水流入河流。",
	"A square-sided pool of water stands in the center of this chamber. Water bubbles up at its center, creating a relaxing fountain effect. It's not at all obvious where this water comes from or how the fountain continues operating. There's no foul odor from the water, but quite a few dead beetles float on the surface and lie at the bottom.": "这个房间中央有一个四面都是方形的水池。水从中心冒出来，形成一个令人放松的喷泉效果。这水是从哪里来的，喷泉是如何继续运作的，一点都不明显。水中没有难闻的气味，但表面和底部漂浮着相当多的死甲虫。",
	"The water is clean and safe to drink, although the dead beetles give it an unpleasant taste. The beetles weren't {@condition poisoned} but simply drowned in the fountain.": "水是干净的，可以安全饮用，尽管死甲虫让它有一种令人不愉快的味道。这些甲虫并非{@condition poisoned}，而只是淹死在喷泉里。",
	"If characters state they remove the dead beetles from the fountain, or if they search the fountain generically and someone makes a successful {@dc 12} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check, they find a bronze hook lying at the bottom. This is a heavy chunk of metal, about the size of someone's hand and weighing several pounds. It's clearly of dwarven make and resembles a stylized, giant fishhook.": "如果角色们表示他们从喷泉中清除死甲虫，或者如果他们在喷泉中进行一般性搜索，然后有人进行了成功的{@dc 12}智力({@skill Investigation})检定，他们会发现一个青铜钩子躺在底部。这是一块沉重的金属块，大约有一个人手大小，重达几磅。显然是矮人制造的，类似于一只风格化的巨型鱼钩。",
	"This hook is magically paired with the fish-shaped container described in Area 320. If it's attached to a rope and lowered through the floating pool to the submerged cylinder, it automatically hooks onto the fish's mouth so the cylinder can be raised from the sea bed. The best way to do this is by threading the rope through the hard-to-spot pulley on the cavern ceiling, as noted in that chamber's description.": "这个钩子与区域320中描述的鱼形容器神奇地配对。如果它被系在绳子上，通过浮动池下降到水下的圆柱体，它会自动钩住鱼嘴，这样圆柱体就可以从海床上升起。最好的方法是通过穿过洞穴天花板上难以发现的滑轮，如该房间描述中所指出的那样。",
	"The hook wound up in the fountain when clacker beetles found it. They were in the process of dragging it back to {@area Area 330|SC-330|x} when they stopped at the fountain for a drink and inadvertently dropped it in. By the time they were done drinking, their tiny brains had forgotten about the shiny hook that was then hidden among the dead beetles lining the bottom of the fountain.": "当啪啪虫发现鱼钩时，它们正打算把它拖回{@area Area 330|SC-330|x}。它们在喷泉边喝水时不小心把鱼钩掉进去了。等它们喝完水后，它们那微小的大脑已经忘记了那个闪闪发光的鱼钩，而它就这样隐藏在喷泉底部的死啪啪虫中。",
	"The door to this tomb lies shattered on the floor. It was smashed open by the trollkin adventurer who died shortly afterward in {@area Area 325|SC-325|x}. Clacker beetles first started swarming her in this tomb immediately after she opened the middle coffin. They drove her back to the mossy caverns, where her retreat was cut off and she was forced into {@area Area 325|SC-325|x} to make her final stand.": "这座墓室的门已经被打碎，散落在地板上。这扇门是被那名巨魔血统的冒险者在{@area Area 325|SC-325|x}中死后砸开的。当她打开中间的棺材后，蟋蟀甲虫立刻开始在这座墓室里蜂拥而至。它们把她赶回了苔藓洞穴，她的撤退被切断，她被迫进入{@area Area 325|SC-325|x}，做出最后的抵抗。",
	"The tomb's stone door lies on the floor, shattered into pieces. Inside are three coffins, each cast as a single block of metal.": "墓穴的石门躺在地板上，已经破碎成碎片。里面有三个棺材，每个都是一整块金属铸造而成。",
	"Those on the ends are copper and tin; the coffin in the middle is bronze. The lid from the middle coffin lies on the floor but the other two are still closed.": "两端的是铜和锡；中间的棺材是青铜。中间棺材的盖子躺在地板上，但另外两个还是关闭着。",
	"The copper coffin is decorated with designs representing fish and water. Any decorations that might remain on the tin coffin are obscured by decades of corrosion and black patina. The middle, bronze coffin shows scenes of a dwarf with a crossbow killing an immense boar.": "这个铜棺材上装饰着代表鱼和水的图案。任何可能留在锡棺材上的装饰都被几十年的腐蚀和黑色铜绿所遮盖。中间的青铜棺材上展示了一个侏儒用弩杀死一只巨大野猪的场景。",
	"Besides the coffins, several large, sealed clay jars are stacked in the corners of the chamber.": "除了棺材外，在房间的角落堆放着几个大的密封粘土罐。",
	"Nothing remains in the middle, bronze coffin but a skull, a pelvis, and a few other large bones. Everything else was eventually devoured or dragged away by clacker beetles.": "在青铜棺中，只剩下一个头骨、一个骨盆和几根其他大骨头。其他所有东西最终都被啮齿甲虫吞噬或拖走了。",
	"The copper, fish-themed sarcophagus holds the bones of a former dwarf ranger. He is arrayed in magical scale mail and clutches a long sword across his chest. The enchantment on the scale mail allows the wearer to make {@skill Stealth} checks normally and confers a swimming speed of 30 feet on the wearer.": "这个铜制的、以鱼为主题的石棺中装着一位前矮人游侠的骨骸。他身穿着魔法鳞甲，手握长剑横放在胸前。鳞甲上的魔法让穿戴者可以正常进行{@skill Stealth}检定，并赋予穿戴者30英尺的游泳速度。",
	"The lid of the tin coffin is nailed on with iron nails. It can be removed readily enough with a {@item crowbar|PHB|prybar} or with a successful {@dc 15} Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check, but it's an odd feature. The dwarves feared this person had died from a vampire bite, so they took precautions. On the inside, the coffin is lined with dried-out garlic and salt, and dozens of holy symbols representing every religion practiced by dwarves across Midgard are placed on the body. There's no danger, however; this dwarf died battling a vampire but wasn't killed in a way that caused him to return as undead. The body is surprisingly well preserved, however—yet another detail that might make characters nervous. Other than the holy symbols, which are mostly silver, the body was interred with no weapons, magic items, or other things of value.": "锡棺材的盖子用铁钉钉住。可以用一个{@item crowbar|PHB|prybar}或者一个成功的{@dc 15}力量({@skill Athletics})检定来轻松地移开，但这是一个奇怪的特征。矮人们担心这个人是死于吸血鬼咬伤，所以他们采取了预防措施。在内部，棺材内衬有干燥的大蒜和盐，还有代表中加德各地矮人信仰的几十个圣符。然而并没有危险；这个矮人是在与吸血鬼战斗中死去的，但并没有以使其变成不死生物的方式被杀死。然而，尸体保存得出奇地完好，这可能会让角色感到紧张。除了大部分是银制的圣符外，尸体没有被埋葬时带有任何武器、魔法物品或其他有价值的东西。",
	"The body isn't the only thing in the coffin, however. A search of the coffin and a successful {@dc 18} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check reveals the coffin has a false bottom with a compartment under it. If the body is removed from the coffin, the {@skill Investigation} check is made with advantage.": "然而，棺材里不仅仅只有尸体。搜索棺材并成功进行 {@dc 18} 智力检定 ({@skill Investigation}) 后，发现棺材底部有一个假底，底部下面有一个隔间。如果将尸体从棺材中取出，进行 {@skill Investigation} 检定时，可以获得优势。",
	"A {@spell detect magic} spell directed toward the tin coffin reveals it is infused with abjuration magic. This is the result of a powerful enchantment similar to {@spell nondetection} meant to shield the contents of the secret compartment.": "对着锡棺材施放的{@spell detect magic}法术显示出它被遗护魔法所注入。这是一种类似{@spell nondetection}的强大魔法，旨在保护秘密隔间的内容。",
	"The copper coffin contains a beautiful but nonmagical {@item longsword|PHB} and magical scale mail that allows the wearer to make {@skill Stealth} checks normally and grants the wearer a swimming speed of 30 feet.

	"The dwarves who built the citadel venerated many deities, but Charun was chief among them. This shrine hasn't seen an adherent of Charun since the citadel fell to the knights of Khors a century ago, and during those silent years it lost whatever connection to the divine it might once have had. The danger now comes from an entirely mundane source.": "建造这座城堡的矮人崇拜许多神灵，但卡伦(Charun)是其中的首领。自这座城堡在一个世纪前被科尔斯骑士团占领以来，这座神殿就再也没有见到过卡伦的信徒，而在这些寂静的年月里，它失去了曾经拥有的与神灵的联系。现在的危险来自一个完全世俗的来源。",
	"There's no mistaking this is a shrine to Charun, god of death and patron of rivers. Or rather, it was such a shrine. A statue of the enigmatic rower rises from dark water beyond a polished granite floor. The dwarves hid their icon well. From the looks of it, you may be the first visitors here in generations.": "毫无疑问，这是一个供奉死神查伦(Charun)和河流守护神的神龛。或者说，曾经是这样的一个神龛。一个神秘的划船者雕像从黑暗的水面上升起，远远超出了抛光的花岗岩地板。矮人们把他们的图标藏得很好。从外表看，你可能是几代人以来第一批来访者。",
	"Still, this area is unusually clean and well preserved compared to the chambers behind you.": "然而，与你身后的房间相比，这个区域异常干净且保存完好。",
	"Although this shrine directly adjoins the clacker beetle nest, the beetles tend to avoid it. The reason lurks in the water: a {@creature gargoctopus|CCodex} (Creature Codex) frequents the area, and it snatches away and devours any clacker beetles it hears scuttling across the stone floor. When the beetles attack en masse, characters who retreat into this chamber can find relative safety along the water's edge; the few beetles that pursue them here hug the wall.": "尽管这座神龛直接毗邻着击鼓甲虫巢穴，但甲虫们往往会避开它。原因在于水中隐藏着一个{@creature gargoctopus|CCodex}（生物图鉴）经常出没的区域，它会抓住并吞噬任何听到击鼓甲虫在石地板上蠕动的声音。当甲虫们大举进攻时，撤退到这个房间的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落的角落",

	"The stream flowing past this shrine is a small branch of the Black River that flows through Level 5. In a world where spatial relationships make sense, this shrine is about 120 feet above the level of the Black River. But the Black River isn't simply flowing water; it's a current of magic. If characters travel along this branch somehow (they'd have to swim, fly, or make a raft from scavenged material—the \"boat\" in this shrine is part of a stone statue), it links up with the Black River somewhere near the portion shown on the Level 5 maps. There's no sensation of descending 120 feet along that watercourse. As far as the rafters are concerned, it's a flat, level trip. The length can be whatever you choose to make it. It can even be different distances when moving in opposite directions.": "这座神龛旁流淌的小溪是黑河的一条支流，黑河贯穿5级。在一个空间关系合理的世界中，这座神龛大约比黑河的水平高120英尺。但黑河并不仅仅是流动的水，它是一股魔力的流动。如果角色以某种方式沿着这条支流前行（他们可能需要游泳、飞行或用拾来的材料制作筏子——神龛中的“船”是石像的一部分），它会在某处与黑河相连，大约在5级地图上显示的部分附近。沿着这条水道，没有感觉下降120英尺。对于筏夫来说，这是一次平坦的旅程。长度可以任意选择。甚至在相反方向移动时，距离也可以不同。",
	"Alternatively, if characters explore this stretch of water but you don't want them on Level 5 yet, after some length of time on the water, they arrive back at the shrine. They might come from the opposite direction (from the south if they headed out to the north, as if they'd traveled in a big circle), or they might approach from the same direction from which they left (somehow returning from the north even though they headed out to the north and never turned around or followed any branches). The Black River doesn't need to make sense; it follows its own rules. Recall the Black River is also a shadow road; characters who get too aggressive about exploring this waterway could suddenly find themselves rushing along the River Argent through the Rothenian Plain, on a mountain lake in the Ironcrags, or even paddling through the sewers of Triolo.": "或者，如果角色探索这段水域，但你不希望他们到达5级，经过一段时间的航行后，他们会回到神龛。他们可能从相反的方向来（如果他们向北出发，他们可能从南方来，就好像他们绕了一个大圈），或者他们可能从离开时的同一方向接近（尽管他们向北出发，从未掉头或跟随任何分支，却以某种方式从北方返回）。黑河不需要有意义；它遵循自己的规则。请记住，黑河也是一条影子之路；对于过于激进地探索这条水路的角色来说，他们可能会突然发现自己沿着阿根特河穿越罗塞尼亚平原，在铁峰山脉的山湖中，甚至划过特里奥洛的下水道。",

You can learn only so much from killing bugs; after that it's just gratuitous slaughter.)": "这个房间里的{@creature clacker beetle|KPSC|clacker beetles}和{@creature clacker beetle swarm|KPSC|clacker beetle swarms}数量实际上是无限的。你可以投掷任意多或任意少的数量对抗队伍，总会有更多可用的。即使角色在这个房间里引爆三只{@spell fireball|PHB|fireballs}，一只接一只，足够的夹击甲虫在它们深深的隧道中存活下来，可以压倒傲慢的团队。(这并不意味着角色可以把这个房间变成一个无限经验农场。如果角色真的与一支甲虫军队战斗，他们应该获得这些甲虫的经验值，但我们建议限制与夹击甲虫战斗的经验值上限为每个角色1,500点。你只能从杀虫子中学到那么多；之后就只是无谓的屠杀。)",
	"Clacker beetles are primarily scavengers, not hunters, so they don't see live humanoids as prey. They do, however, see large, noisy creatures as threats, and any threat near the nest must be eliminated at any cost.": "响螫甲虫主要是食腐动物，而不是猎食者，因此它们不会将活着的人型生物视为猎物。然而，它们会将大型、吵闹的生物视为威胁，任何靠近巢穴的威胁必须以任何代价消除。",
	"The key to safety in this chamber, then, is being slow, stealthy, and methodical. A character who stands still and makes no loud noises or sudden moves—such as those involved in casting most spells, but not (for example) bending down to pick up a ruby from the floor—isn't bothered. A character who moves no more than 5 feet in a turn must make a successful {@dc 8} Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check to avoid causing alarm in the nest. A character who moves 6 to 10 feet in a turn makes the same {@skill Stealth} check but with disadvantage. A character who moves farther than 10 feet in a turn or does anything else a nervous beetle might find startling—brandishing a weapon, casting a noisy or flashy spell, shining a {@item bullseye lantern|PHB} around the room or opening a {@item hooded lantern|PHB}, speaking above a whisper, bumping against one of the nest mounds, or kicking over a small heap of coins— automatically causes alarm in the nest.": "在这个房间里，安全的关键是缓慢、隐秘和有条不紊。一个角色如果站着不发出响亮的声音或突然的动作——比如施放大多数法术，但不包括(例如)弯腰捡起地板上的红宝石——就不会被打扰。一个角色在一个回合内移动不超过5英尺，必须进行一次成功的{@dc 8}敏捷({@skill Stealth})检定，以避免在巢穴中引起警报。一个角色在一个回合内移动6到10英尺，也需要进行相同的{@skill Stealth}检定，但带有劣势。一个角色在一个回合内移动超过10英尺，或做出任何让紧张的甲虫感到惊讶的事情——挥舞武器、施放吵闹或华丽的法术、在房间里照明{@item bullseye lantern|PHB}或打开{@item hooded lantern|PHB}、大声说话、碰到巢穴之一、或踢翻一小堆硬币——都会自动引起巢穴中的警报。",
	"Once an alarm is triggered—and it's inevitable, eventually, no matter what characters do (see {@adventure The Swarm|KPSC|6|The Swarm})—characters are attacked by one {@creature clacker beetle|KPSC} and one {@creature clacker beetle swarm|KPSC} per every two characters in the party. Another beetle and swarm joins in every round, or more if you deem it necessary to maintain the excitement. See {@adventure The Swarm|KPSC|6|The Swarm} for advice on staging this part of the level.": "一旦警报被触发——这是不可避免的，无论角色们做了什么（见{@adventure The Swarm|KPSC|6|The Swarm}）——每两名角色中的一名会受到一只{@creature clacker beetle|KPSC}和一只{@creature clacker beetle swarm|KPSC}的攻击。另一只甲虫和一群虫群会在每一轮加入战斗，或者如果你认为有必要保持紧张感，可以加入更多。参见{@adventure The Swarm|KPSC|6|The Swarm}，获取关于设置这个层级的建议。",
	"The beetles have accumulated significant treasure in this vault by raiding the grave goods left in the tombs. In each 5-foot square, careful characters can gather 1 to 600 ({@dice 1d100 × 1d6}) gp worth of coins, loose gems, jewelry, small decorative carvings, and other trinkets. Clearing a single 5-foot space this way without alarming the nest takes at least 5 minutes of slow, methodical movement. Going faster than that requires a {@dc 8} {@skill Stealth} check, and going much faster causes alarm automatically.": "这个甲虫群通过掠夺坟墓中留下的财宝在这个地下室中积累了大量的财富。在每个5英尺的正方形区域，细心的角色可以收集价值1到600({@dice 1d100 × 1d6}) gp的硬币、散珠、珠宝、小装饰雕刻品和其他小玩意。以这种方式清理一个5英尺的空间，而不引起巢穴的警觉，至少需要5分钟的缓慢、有条不紊的移动。比这更快的速度需要进行一次{@dc 8} {@skill Stealth}检定，而更快的行动会自动引起警报。",
	"Two special items of note can be found here by persistent characters. These are a {@item potion of supreme healing} in a crystal vial with a topaz stopper (hauled from the slain trollkin's kit) and a gold {@item ring of lightning resistance}. You can place these wherever you like, but both should be in different spaces and at least 20 feet from where characters enter the chamber.": "坚持不懈的角色可以在这里找到两个特别的物品。这些是一个水晶瓶中的{@item potion of supreme healing}，上面有一个黄玉塞子（从被杀的巨魔族的装备中拿出来的），还有一个金{@item ring of lightning resistance}。你可以把它们放在任何你喜欢的地方，但两者应该在不同的空间，并且距离角色进入的地方至少20英尺。",
	"The hole in the floor of this cavern opens in the ceiling of {@area Area 406|SC-406|x}. The floor of that cavern is 50 feet below this one. There are no ropes, ladders, or notched handholds to serve as climbing aids, just a 50-foot drop to the cave floor. There are a few broken stones here a rope could be tied to plus plenty of places where a spike can be hammered into the wall to secure a rope. Other than that possible escape route for reckless characters who choose to flee into this room from pursuing beetles, there's nothing of interest here.": "这个洞穴地板上的洞口通向{@area Area 406|SC-406|x}的天花板。那个洞穴的地板比这个低50英尺。这里没有绳索、梯子或凹槽作为攀爬辅助，只是一个50英尺的掉落到洞穴地板。这里有一些破碎的石头，可以绑绳子，还有很多地方可以钉入墙壁来固定绳子。除了那些选择从追赶的甲虫中逃入这个房间的鲁莽角色可能的逃生路线外，这里没有其他有趣的东西。",
	"This level is the clacker beetles' home, and they become aware of intruders as soon as the characters arrive. Clacker beetles aren't very intelligent but they do have a well-honed instinct for survival and for defending the nest. Note the layout of the map. No matter where characters are searching and exploring in the tombs, clacker beetles can move quietly through other chambers and corridors to get past the intruders and surround them.": "这个层次是(`Clacker Beetles`)的家园，当角色到达时，它们就会察觉到入侵者。`Clacker Beetles`并不是很聪明，但它们有着对生存和保卫巢穴的敏锐本能。请注意地图的布局。无论角色在墓穴中搜索和探索的地方，`Clacker Beetles`都可以悄无声息地穿过其他房间和走廊，绕过入侵者并包围它们。",
	"The whole time characters are on this map, clacker beetles are stealthily maneuvering all around them. Unless characters post guards in positions where they can see every passage, the beetles find a way to get around them unseen. When the time is right, they attack en masse from every direction.": "在地图上的整个时间里，当角色们在这张地图上时，(clacker beetles)悄悄地在他们周围操纵着。除非角色们在可以看到每个通道的位置上设立警卫，否则这些甲虫会找到一种无人察觉地绕过他们的方法。当时机成熟时，它们会从各个方向集体发动攻击。",
	"\"When the time is right\" is up to you. If characters assault the nesting chamber ({@area Area 330|SC-330|x}) or cause alarm there, that certainly qualifies. If they unleash an alarming string of destructive magic (multiple rapid-fire {@spell thunderwave} spells in the warlocks' tomb, for example), that's another good trigger. Or if they're just being overly cautious and you're getting bored, that's an equally good excuse to liven things up. Ideally, however, the attack should come near the end of the party's explorations, after they've had a glimpse into the nesting chamber so they have an inkling of what they're losing out on by retreating.": "\"合适的时机\" 由你决定。如果角色进攻了筑巢室 ({@area Area 330|SC-330|x}) 或在那里引起了警报，那肯定符合条件。如果他们释放了一连串令人震惊的破坏性魔法（例如在术士之墓中连续施放多个快速的 {@spell thunderwave} 法术），那是另一个很好的触发条件。或者如果他们只是过分谨慎，而你感到无聊，那也是一个同样好的借口来活跃气氛。然而，理想情况下，袭击应该发生在探险队的探索接近尾声时，他们已经瞥见了筑巢室，因此对撤退所失去的东西有所了解。",
	"Remember, the number of soldier beetles and swarms is limitless. That doesn't give you carte blanche to overwhelm the characters with a single massive attack and kill everyone. You want to deliver a series of blows that knock the characters off balance and keep them that way until they withdraw from the level. Ideally that will be a fighting withdrawal with characters battling their way through weak points in the beetles' deployment to escape from traps and constantly seeking ways to get closer to the exit.": "记住，士兵甲虫和蜂群的数量是无限的。这并不意味着你可以用一次大规模攻击来压倒所有角色并杀死他们。你应该给角色一系列打击，让他们失去平衡，并保持这种状态直到他们撤离这个区域。理想情况下，这将是一场战斗性的撤退，角色们要在甲虫部署的薄弱点中奋战，逃离陷阱，并不断寻找接近出口的方法。",
	"Throw a wave of beetles at the party from several directions and, when those are nearly (but not entirely) all gone, launch the next wave. Appear to leave a path open for retreat, then when characters take it, slam it shut with another wave of beetles. Make it seem that the beetles are nearly wiped out and characters are on the verge of triumph, then bring in the biggest wave of reinforcements they've seen yet.": "从几个方向向队伍投掷一波甲虫，当这些甲虫几乎（但不完全）全部消失时，再发动下一波。似乎留下一条撤退的通道，然后当角色们走上时，用另一波甲虫将其封锁。让甲虫看起来几乎被消灭，角色们似乎即将取得胜利，然后引入他们见过的最大规模的增援波。",
	"Don't make it a shooting gallery; characters need to be pressed hard and pushed to the brink of defeat by every wave for players to feel the excitement. When they're down to their last spells and their last hit points, and they're certain the next wave is bound to roll over them, that's the time for the beetles to commit a small but important mistake and leave a weak perimeter the characters can smash through to escape with their lives—barely.": "不要把它变成一个射击场; 角色需要被紧逼并被每一波敌人逼到失败的边缘，让玩家感受到紧张刺激。当他们只剩下最后的法术和最后一点生命值，他们确信下一波敌人就要将他们淹没时，这时甲虫们犯下一个小但重要的错误，留下一个薄弱的防线，让角色们勉强逃生。(%num%)。",
	"In these fights, aim for a roughly even mix of soldier beetles and swarms. Vary the sizes of the waves. You can start big or small, but keep mixing it up. A small wave should have one enemy per character. A big one could have two, three, or even four enemies per character if they're arrayed in a way that lets the characters narrowly escape from a trap and bottle them up. Remember, the soldiers have a trait that allows them to double up in a 5-foot space, and a swarm can be in there too. Soldiers also like to position themselves behind swarms and attack by clacking. The more beetles overlap their clacking cones on targets, the better.": "在这些战斗中，目标是士兵甲虫和虫群的数量大致相等。变化波次的大小。你可以从大到小开始，但要保持混合。小波次应该是每个角色一个敌人。大波次可以是每个角色两个、三个，甚至四个敌人，如果它们排列在一起，让角色们勉强逃脱陷阱并将它们困住。记住，士兵有一个特性，允许它们在5英尺的空间中双重存在，虫群也可以在其中。士兵们还喜欢站在虫群后面，通过夹击攻击。更多甲虫重叠它们的夹击锥状攻击目标，效果更好。",
	"Again, put the pressure on and keep it on, but keep it pulsing. Like any story, the battle should have dramatic highs and lows, furious action and brief lulls. The beetles are an implacable foe that simply doesn't ever give up.": "继续施加压力，并保持节奏。就像任何故事一样，战斗应该有戏剧性的高潮和低谷，激烈的动作和短暂的平静。甲虫是一个不可动摇的敌人，永远不会放弃。",
	"If characters retreat to rest after only partially clearing this level, the trollkin's aggressive response is detailed in the introductory section of this level. Once the level is cleared, a few things can still happen to cause problems for the characters.": "如果角色在只清理了这一层的部分区域后撤退休息，巨魔族的攻击性反应会在这一层的介绍部分中详细描述。一旦这一层被清理，仍然有一些事情可能会导致角色遇到问题。",
	"First, some number of trollkin and lich hounds could have been away on a hunt or a raid when the characters arrived. Returning to find all their clansfolk killed is certain to set them on the path of vengeance. They are more than capable of resetting the level's traps and devising new ones in likely areas such as the tunnel to the surface ({@area Area 318|SC-318|x}) and the drop down to the bat caverns. Something as simple as weakening the fungus-rope ladder so it breaks while someone is climbing it gives that character a long fall and potentially traps the whole group in the deep levels.": "首先，一些巨魔族和巫妖猎犬可能在角色到达时正在进行狩猎或袭击。当他们返回发现所有族人都被杀害时，肯定会让他们踏上复仇之路。他们有能力重新设置关卡的陷阱，并在可能的地方设计新的陷阱，比如通往地表的隧道和下到蝙蝠洞穴的陡坡。简单的方法，比如削弱真菌绳梯，使得有人在爬行时断裂，导致角色摔落并潜在地困住整个团队在深层。",
	"Second, one or two dire owlbears were left out of the level's forces because a few are always out hunting. Being barely intelligent, they're unlikely to seek revenge for murder; they kill for the sake of killing. They might also rip apart the fungus-rope ladder in the hole once the party uses it and gets their stink on it.": "其次，由于一些一直在外面狩猎，该层的力量中留下了一两只凶猛猫头鹰熊。它们几乎没有智慧，不太可能为谋杀寻求报复；它们杀戮只是为了杀戮。一旦队伍使用了蘑菇绳梯并在上面留下了气味，它们还可能撕裂洞中的绳梯。",
	"Finally, the ring servant continues prowling through this level once activated in search of its enemies until it or they are destroyed. It's up to you whether it recovers hit points between battles; we recommend giving it {@dice 12d10} Hit Dice and letting it heal via those, the same as a character. It recovers half its Hit Dice every 24 hours. The monolith footmen might also aid the ring servant by blocking critical pathways, as they did at the top of the stairs outside Thor's shrine.": "最终，一旦被激活，环之仆从会继续在这个层次中搜寻敌人，直到它们被摧毁。关于它是否在战斗之间恢复生命值，这取决于你；我们建议给予它{@dice 12d10}个命中骰，并让它通过这些来恢复，就像一个角色一样。它每24小时恢复一半的命中骰。石碑步兵也可能通过阻挡关键路径来帮助环之仆从，就像它们在索尔神龛外的楼梯顶部所做的那样。",
	"The bat caverns offer a potentially stark contrast to the trollkin-occupied barracks. Initially, stealth is paramount, but even the stealthiest group is bound to be discovered eventually. Retreat from this level while under attack is impossible, since the only way out is to climb 80 feet up the rope ladder (from {@area Area 401|SC-401|x} up to {@area Area 317|SC-317|x}) while under attack by flying enemies.": "蝙蝠洞提供了与巨魔占领的兵营截然不同的潜在景象。最初，隐秘至关重要，但即使是最擅长隐秘的团队也终将被发现。在受到攻击时从这一层撤退是不可能的，因为唯一的出路是在受到飞行敌人攻击的情况下爬上80英尺长的绳梯（从{@area Area 401|SC-401|x}到{@area Area 317|SC-317|x}）。",
	"The adventure offers you two different ways to run this level. Your decision on which to use should be based on the temperament of your players and your estimation of what they want from the adventure.": "这个冒险为你提供了两种不同的方式来进行这个关卡。你的决定应该基于玩家的性格和你对他们想要从冒险中得到什么的估计。",
	"The more complicated approach treats this level as a delicate balance-of-power situation between three rival factions. All three would be happy to kill the characters, but only after they help them defeat the rival factions. Only one of those factions is committed to stopping the characters from descending deeper into the citadel and confronting {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}. The characters alone aren't strong enough to defeat all three groups. They need to use diplomacy, intimidation, and subterfuge to play the factions against each other and defeat them one by one.": "更复杂的方法将这一层视为三个敌对派系之间微妙的力量平衡局势。这三个派系都乐意杀死角色，但只有在他们帮助他们击败敌对派系之后才会这样做。只有其中一个派系致力于阻止角色深入城堡更深处并面对{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}。角色们单打独斗不足以击败所有三个团体。他们需要运用外交、恐吓和隐秘手段来让派系相互对抗，并逐个击败它们。",
	"Some groups of players are just not cut out for—or not interested in—that kind of roleplaying challenge. This might sound cynical, but long experience shows that trying to shoehorn players into an intricate style of play they dislike and have no aptitude for is usually counterproductive. For them, we offer a more straightforward situation in which it's possible for characters to infiltrate the first group, slaughter everyone, smash into the second group, slaughter everyone, smash into the third group—and maybe slaughter everyone, or maybe the party will be the ones getting slaughtered at that point. By the end, they'll certainly be covered in something—whether it's glory or ignominy depends on whether the characters really are the badasses they believe themselves to be.": "有些玩家团队可能并不适合——或者对那种角色扮演挑战不感兴趣。这听起来可能有点愤世嫉俗，但长期经验表明，试图把玩家们硬塞到他们不喜欢、也没有天赋的复杂游戏风格中通常是适得其反的。对于他们，我们提供了一个更为直接的情景，角色可以渗透到第一组，屠杀所有人，然后冲进第二组，屠杀所有人，再冲进第三组——也许还会屠杀所有人，或者也许此时整个队伍会被屠杀。到最后，他们肯定会被某种东西覆盖着——无论是荣耀还是耻辱取决于角色们是否真的是他们自认为的硬汉。",
	"Although the second approach is almost entirely oriented around combat, the first approach isn't combat-free. The characters are bound to fight several desperate battles on this level either way. The differences are how they get into these fights and the consequences for failure.": "尽管第二种方法几乎完全围绕战斗展开，但第一种方法并非没有战斗。这些角色注定会在这个层面上进行几场拼死搏斗。区别在于他们如何卷入这些战斗以及失败的后果。",
	"In numbered area descriptions, notes applying to the straightforward assault approach are labeled Into the Fray. Notes applying to the more intricate, political approach are under the label Delicate Balance.": "在编号区域描述中，适用于直接突袭方法的注释标记为“冲入战团”(Into the Fray)。适用于更为复杂的政治手段的注释则标记为“微妙平衡”(Delicate Balance)。",
	"This level is divided into three distinct areas: the bat caverns and temple of Camazotz with its fanatical bat cultists, the derro village where inhabitants brew and imbibe reality-altering fungal concoctions, and the sanctum of {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC} and her diabolic servants. The area also has several important features that exist in a parallel reality. These become visible and accessible only after imbibing plane-shifting fungal extracts cooked up by the derro. Crossing the threshold into this alternate reality involves some risk but also offers advantages on both this level and Level 5.": "这个层次分为三个独特的区域：蝙蝠洞穴和卡马佐茨神庙，那里有狂热的蝙蝠教徒；德罗村庄，居民酿造和饮用改变现实的真菌混合物；以及{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}和她的恶魔仆从的圣所。该区域还有一些重要的特征存在于平行现实中。只有在饮用德罗烹制的变位真菌提取物之后，这些特征才会变得可见和可访问。跨越到这个替代现实的门槛涉及一些风险，但也提供了在这个层次和第5层上的优势。",
	"All derro have an affinity for bats; only the most extreme end up worshiping {@creature Camazotz, Demon Lord of Bats and Fire|ToB|Camazotz, the demon lord of bats and fire}.": "所有矮人族都对蝙蝠有亲和力；只有极端的人最终会崇拜{@creature Camazotz, Demon Lord of Bats and Fire|ToB|Camazotz, the demon lord of bats and fire}。",
	"A derro {@creature speaker to the darkness|CCodex} (Creature Codex) named {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} led his band of outcasts along the Black River until they found this cavern and its population of giant vampire bats, saber-toothed bats, bat swarms, and flame eater swarms. Recognizing a sign from Camazotz when he saw one, {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} declared this spot to be their new home. The derro built a small village, constructed a temple, and set about establishing dominance over the bats and raiding the surface for slaves. After the citadel dwarves were wiped out and the barracks above was left empty, the derro mined up to the stables so they could use the owlbears' tunnel as a shortcut to the surface.": "一个{@creature speaker to the darkness|CCodex} (生物宝典) 名为{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}的德罗带领着他的流亡者团队沿着黑河前行，直到他们发现了这个洞穴及其居住着巨型吸血蝙蝠、剑齿蝙蝠、蝙蝠群和火焰吞噬者群的居民。当{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}看到这个迹象时，他认出这是卡玛佐茨的暗示，便宣布这个地方为他们的新家园。德罗们建造了一个小村庄，修建了一座神庙，并开始建立对蝙蝠的统治，并洗劫地表寻找奴隶。在城堡矮人被消灭后，地面上的军营被留空，德罗们挖掘到马厩，以便利用猫头鹰熊的隧道作为通往地表的捷径。",
	"On one of their raids, the derro captured a red dragonborn. When the captive demonstrated it could breathe fire (during an escape attempt in which several derro were killed), he saw an opportunity. He fed the dragonborn a diet of ego-suppressing lichen extract, renamed him {@creature Drakustanz|KPSC}, gave him a degree of provisional freedom (but with his will to resist crushed), and elevated him to a position of great ceremonial significance within the cult.": "在一次突袭中，德罗俘虏了一名红色龙裔。当俘虏展示出它可以喷火的能力（在一次逃跑尝试中，几名德罗被杀），他看到了一个机会。他给龙裔喂食了一种抑制自我的地衣提取物，将他更名为{@creature Drakustanz|KPSC}，给予了他一定程度的临时自由（但他的抵抗意志被击溃），并将他提升到了教派内具有重大仪式意义的职位。",
	"After the derro settled here, a rift developed between two contentious leaders. On one side are {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} and his fanatical worshipers of Camazotz and the giant bats of the cavern. On the other are {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}, a {@creature derro witch queen|CCodex} (Creature Codex), and her loyalists who've grown tired of chanting endlessly to bats through a haze of soporific smoke and prefer traditional derro pursuits such as raiding the surface, tormenting captives, and brewing dangerous fungal extracts.": "在derro定居后，两位争议领袖之间产生了分歧。一方是{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}及其对卡马佐茨(Camazotz)和洞穴中的巨蝙蝠狂热崇拜者。另一方是{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}，一位{@creature derro witch queen|CCodex}（生物宝典）和她的忠实追随者，他们已经厌倦了在迷幻烟雾中无休止地向蝙蝠吟唱，更喜欢传统的derro活动，如袭击地表、折磨俘虏和酿造危险的真菌提取物。",
	"The presence of {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC} keeps the tension between {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} and {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC} from erupting into a bloody battle for dominance. Imortra commands more power than either group of derro in the form of conjured devils, and she skillfully plays the derro factions against each other to keep them in fear and serving her interest.": "{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}的存在使得{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}和{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}之间的紧张局势没有演变成为争夺主导权的血腥战斗。伊莫特拉 (Imortra) 拥有比德若 (derro) 任何一方更强大的力量，通过召唤恶魔的方式巧妙地操纵着这两个德若派别，让他们彼此之间互相恐惧并为她的利益服务。",
	"Imortra is Gellert's top disciple. He trusts her as much as he trusts anyone, and he ensures her loyalty with a skillful mélange of bribes and intimidation. For her part, Imortra is well aware of the risk she runs associating with someone like Gellert but she considers him a useful master. Although he guards his secrets jealously, he's already taught her things she couldn't have learned elsewhere and given her access to vast ley-line power. She hopes to one day supplant the master, if she survives the apprenticeship.": "伊莫特拉 (Imortra) 是盖勒特 (Gellert) 的首席门徒。他对她的信任程度不亚于对任何人的信任，通过巧妙的贿赂和恐吓确保了她的忠诚。对于伊莫特拉来说，她深知与像盖勒特这样的人交往所带来的风险，但她认为他是一个有用的导师。尽管他嫉妒地保守着自己的秘密，但他已经教会了她一些她在其他地方学不到的东西，并让她接触到了广阔的地脉力量。她希望有朝一日能够取代这位导师，如果她在学徒期间幸存下来的话。",
	"A large number of captives are also held on this level. Most of them are too weak to be any help in the inevitable battles, and they are a significant burden to the characters when they're released.": "这一层还关押着大量俘虏。其中大部分太虚弱了，在即将到来的战斗中无法提供任何帮助，而且当他们被释放时，对角色们来说是一个重要的负担。",
	"If you opt for this approach, the level consists of three distinct \"battle zones\" with little overlap. The bat cultists occupy Areas {@area 401|SC-401|x}–{@area 412|SC-412|x}. The derro villagers occupy {@area Areas 414|SC-414|x} and {@area 415|SC-415|x}. {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC} and her minions occupy {@area Areas 416|SC-416|x}–{@area 418|SC-418|x}. {@area Area 413|SC-413|x} is its own encounter.": "如果你选择这种方法，这个层面由三个不同的“战斗区域”组成，几乎没有重叠。蝙蝠教徒占据区域 {@area 401|SC-401|x}–{@area 412|SC-412|x}。德罗村民占据 {@area Areas 414|SC-414|x} 和 {@area 415|SC-415|x}。{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC} 和她的手下占据 {@area Areas 416|SC-416|x}–{@area 418|SC-418|x}。{@area Area 413|SC-413|x} 是一个独立的遭遇。",
	"A fight in one of these battle zones doesn't spill into an adjacent zone, and creatures in other zones don't react or respond to a ruckus outside their zone. The exception is if characters run from one zone to another in the middle of a battle; enemies may pursue in that case, if it seems tactically wise for them to do so.": "在这些战斗区域之一的战斗不会波及到相邻区域，其他区域的生物不会对外面区域的喧哗做出反应或回应。唯一的例外是如果角色在战斗中从一个区域跑到另一个区域；在这种情况下，如果敌人认为追击是明智的战术，他们可能会追击。",
	"Within their own zone, enemies are free to move and respond to threats as effectively as you deem appropriate. The area where this matters most is the bat cavern ({@area Area 403|SC-403|x}). The fight in that area starts small, but reinforcements flow in continually from more distant parts of the zone. The pacing in this battle is particularly important (see {@area 403. Bat Cavern|SC-403|x} for more information).": "在他们自己的区域内，敌人可以自由移动并根据您认为合适的方式应对威胁。这一点最重要的地方是蝙蝠洞穴({@area Area 403|SC-403|x})。那个区域的战斗从小规模开始，但不断有增援从区域更远的地方涌入。这场战斗的节奏尤为重要（详见{@area 403. Bat Cavern|SC-403|x}了解更多信息）。",
	"Characters can take short rests after battles, but under this option they can't take long rests anywhere on this level. If they try, their rest is interrupted by an attack from either derro dements (if they're resting after the first battle) or by devilish scouts (if they're resting after the second battle). To finish a long rest, they need to withdraw from this level entirely. Even then, scouts might seek them out on the level above. The farther they withdraw, the safer they're likely to be.": "角色可以在战斗后休息，但在这个选项下，他们不能在这个层面的任何地方进行长休息。如果他们尝试休息，他们的休息会被狄洛疯子（如果他们在第一场战斗后休息）或恶魔侦察兵（如果他们在第二场战斗后休息）的袭击中断。要完成一次长休息，他们需要完全撤离这个层面。即使如此，侦察兵可能会在上一层找到他们。他们撤离得越远，就越安全。",
	"Taking a long rest does give the derro villagers and Imortra time to realize their homes are about to be attacked. They can't be surprised once they're alerted this way. Some defensive measures they can take include cutting down or dangerously weakening the rope ladder, posting sentries, and rigging traps on the most likely approach routes ({@area Areas 412|SC-412|x}, {@area 414|SC-414|x}, and {@area 416|SC-416|x}). Every derro is provided a {@item potion of augmented reality|KPSC} that is downed at the first sign of trouble. Imortra casts {@spell mage armor} on herself beforehand and plans to cast {@spell banishment} on whomever she perceives to be the most powerful spellcaster in the group as an initial volley.": "进行长休让德罗村民和伊莫特拉有时间意识到他们的家园即将受到攻击。一旦通过这种方式被警告，他们就不会被突袭。他们可以采取的一些防御措施包括砍断或危险地削弱绳梯、设置哨兵，并在最可能的进攻路线上设置陷阱（{@area Areas 412|SC-412|x}、{@area 414|SC-414|x}和{@area 416|SC-416|x}）。每个德罗都配备了一个警报器，在出现麻烦的第一个迹象时会被触发。伊莫特拉事先对自己施放了{@spell mage armor}，并计划在最强大的法术施法者中的任何一个身上施放{@spell banishment} 作为初始攻击。",
	"If you opt for this approach, the number of foes is significantly higher than it would be under option 1. Since characters don't need to fight them in quick succession and can even have allies in some fights, these battles are still winnable.": "如果你选择这种方法，敌人的数量会比选项1下要多得多。由于角色们不需要连续快速地与他们战斗，甚至在一些战斗中可以有盟友，这些战斗仍然是可以赢得的。",
	"Of the three \"political\" divisions on this level, only {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC} is interested in stopping intruders from reaching the next level down where {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} resides. The derro profess their loyalty to Imortra (not to Gellert, whom they've never seen), but their pledges mean nothing. They're barely sane at the best of times, and between the derro's fevered worship of Camazotz and the dangerous fungal extracts they imbibe, these times are less than ideal.": "在这个层次上的三个“政治”分裂中，只有{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}对阻止入侵者到达下一层，{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}所在的地方感兴趣。德罗宣称他们忠于伊莫特拉（而不是吉勒特，他们从未见过），但他们的誓言毫无意义。他们在最好的时候都几乎不理智，而在德罗对卡马佐茨的狂热崇拜和他们摄入的危险真菌提取物之间，这些时刻远非理想。",
	"Both groups of derro are vile and depraved. They have no sense of right or wrong. The strong do what they want and the weak cringe and cower to survive. No matter where an individual derro falls on that scale, they all enjoy tormenting and bullying anything weaker than themselves. Being bullied doesn't give them empathy for creatures in a similar plight; it only makes them want to punish something smaller even more. They don't fall in love, they don't care for the sick or the elderly or the wounded, and their own children survive on scraps and fear. If given the chance, they gleefully enslave the characters, blind them, torture them to death, and eat their flesh—perhaps not in that order. The bats have a more stable society than the derro.": "两组矮人都是邪恶且堕落的。他们没有对错的概念。强者为所欲为，弱者则畏缩和屈服以求生存。无论一个矮人个体在这个尺度上处于何种位置，他们都喜欢折磨和欺凌比自己更弱小的生物。被欺凌并不会让他们对处境相似的生物产生同情；相反，这只会让他们更想惩罚比自己更小的东西。他们不会坠入爱河，也不会关心病弱、老弱或受伤者，他们自己的孩子只能靠残羹剩饭和恐惧求生。如果有机会，他们会欣然奴役角色，使他们失明，折磨至死，然后吃掉他们的肉 —— 或许不一定按照这个顺序。蝙蝠比矮人拥有一个更加稳定的社会。",
	"To survive here, the characters must make deals with these monsters.": "要在这里生存，角色们必须与这些怪物达成交易。",
	"Characters need to be cautious as they enter the bat caverns. The large and small caverns contain more than enough bats of every kind to overwhelm most parties, and that's before any derro get involved.": "角色们进入蝙蝠洞穴时需要小心。这些大大小小的洞穴里有足够多的各种蝙蝠，足以压倒大多数队伍，而这还不包括任何德罗人(`derro`)的介入。",
	"Bear in mind, however, that a 6th-level wizard has the potential to cast three {@spell fireball|PHB|fireballs} in rapid succession. That's the perfect weapon in a wide-open arena like the central cavern ({@area Area 403|SC-403|x}), especially against flying enemies and swarms. If you set out hoping to shepherd characters through this level on the Delicate Balance path but make a mistake during the opening moves that results in most of the bats being rapidly slaughtered, you can try to recover the situation, or you can just go with it and switch to Into the Fray.": "请记住，然而，一个6级的法师有潜力连续施放三个{@spell fireball|PHB|fireballs}。这在像中央洞穴{@area Area 403|SC-403|x}这样的宽阔竞技场中是完美的武器，特别是对付飞行敌人和虫群。如果你计划引导角色们通过“微妙平衡”路径的这一层，但在开局时犯了一个错误，导致大部分蝙蝠被迅速屠杀，你可以尝试挽回局面，或者干脆接受并切换到“投入战斗”路径。",
	"A useful parallel here is a zombie apocalypse. Think of the bats like zombies. They're an obstacle, dangerous to someone who's cornered and out of options, but the real enemy is the living derro. The bats are just animals. The derro cultists are insane and homicidal.": "这里可以用僵尸启示。把蝙蝠想象成僵尸。它们是一个障碍，对于被困住且无路可走的人来说是危险的，但真正的敌人是活着的德洛族人。蝙蝠只是动物。德洛邪教徒是疯狂且杀人狂。",
	"Unlike the Into the Fray option, the total enemy force here now is overwhelming even for 6th-level characters, and there's nowhere to hide and no safe way to retreat. Characters who try to smash their way through the level will kill plenty of bats and probably many derro, but in one long battle their luck runs out when Imortra and her conjured devils show up. Because the only way in or out (initially) is via an 80-foot rope ladder, characters who try to retreat will be picked off like birds on a wire.": "与《冲入战场》(Into the Fray)选项不同，这里的敌人总数即使对于6级角色来说也是势不可挡的，没有任何地方可以躲藏，也没有安全的撤退方式。试图强行通过关卡的角色会杀死大量蝙蝠，可能还会杀死许多德罗，但当伊莫特拉(Imortra)和她召唤出的恶魔出现时，他们的运气终将耗尽。因为最初进出的唯一方式是通过一条80英尺长的绳梯，试图撤退的角色将会像电线上的鸟一样被一个个击倒。",
	"So what are characters to do? How can they \"defeat\" this level?": "那么角色们该怎么办呢？他们如何才能“击败”这个关卡呢？",
	"The only reason the derro tolerate Imortra's presence is fear; they fear her and her conjured devils, and they're terrified of her unseen overlord {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}. They don't care for each other either. The Camazotz cultists under {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} think their non-worshiping cousins are heretics, and the fungus-growers under {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC} think the bat cultists are maniacs who'll be torn apart and eaten by their beloved bats eventually.": "唯一让德罗人容忍伊莫特拉（Imortra）存在的原因是恐惧；他们害怕她和她召唤的恶魔，他们也害怕她看不见的主宰{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}。他们彼此也不关心。{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} 领导下的卡马索茨教徒认为他们不崇拜的表亲是异端，而{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC} 领导下的菌类培育者则认为蝙蝠教徒是疯子，最终会被他们心爱的蝙蝠撕成碎片并吞食。",
	"Ideally, you want characters to get through this level by talking to its residents. The derro aren't here as guards. Unless characters are in the act of slaughtering all the bats, {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} is intrigued by the appearance of powerful outsiders who could upset the local balance of power in his favor. {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} and {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC} would both be happy to hear that the characters intend to kill Gellert. Either group will even offer to help them kill Imortra, provided they also wipe out the other band of derro.": "理想情况下，你希望角色通过与居民交谈来通过这一关卡。德罗不在这里担任卫兵。除非角色正在屠杀所有蝙蝠，{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}对强大的外来者的出现感到好奇，因为他们可能会打破当地的权力平衡，对他有利。{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}和{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}都会很高兴听到角色打算杀死盖勒特。任何一组甚至会提出帮助他们杀死伊莫特拉，前提是他们也消灭另一群德罗。",
	"If someone is wearing {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}'s {@item purple amethyst brooch|KPSC|amethyst brooch}, the derro assume that character is in charge and address all their conversation toward the wearer. They figure out fairly quickly that the character is an imposter who stole the brooch from someone on an upper level, but it buys the wearer great deference in the meantime.": "如果有人戴着{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}的{@item purple amethyst brooch|KPSC|amethyst brooch}，德罗会认为那个角色是负责人，并将所有对话都指向那个佩戴者。他们很快就会发现那个角色是一个冒名顶替者，偷了别人在上层的胸针，但与此同时，这让佩戴者得到了极大的尊重。",
	"The derro absolutely can't be trusted as allies; in fact, they're guaranteed to turn against the characters once their enemies have been killed. The chance for treasure and slaughter is irresistible to them, whereas the notion they should honor a promise to outsiders barely registers. Once they see what the characters are capable of, the derro might even throw a feast in the characters' honor and slip sleeping poison into their food or capture them in their sleep.": "绝对不能相信德罗(Derro)作为盟友；事实上，一旦他们的敌人被杀死，他们肯定会背叛角色。对于财宝和屠杀的机会对他们来说是无法抗拒的，而对于他们应该遵守对外人的承诺这种概念几乎不值一提。一旦他们看到角色的能力，德罗甚至可能为了向角色致敬而举行宴会，并在他们的食物中投放催眠毒药或在他们睡觉时将他们捕获。",
	"In the end, the characters may wind up defeating everything on this level anyway. But if they approach the situation intelligently, they can play the three factions against each other and fight them one at a time instead of all at once and thereby have a chance to survive.": "最终，角色们可能会在这个层面上击败一切。但如果他们以聪明的方式处理这种情况，他们可以让三个派系相互对抗，逐个击败它们，而不是一次性全部对抗，从而有机会生存。",
	"{@i You can't railroad characters into this line of action.} Give them clues and opportunities, but the players decide what their characters do. If they form a plan that's guaranteed to fail and get them killed or captured (or they blunder ahead with no plan at all), you should point out the immense risk, but you can't forbid them from choosing their own path.": "{@i You can't railroad characters into this line of action.} 给予他们线索和机会，但玩家们决定他们的角色会做什么。如果他们制定了一个注定会失败并导致被杀或被捕的计划（或者他们毫无计划地冲锋），你应该指出巨大的风险，但你不能阻止他们选择自己的道路。",
	"Always be flexible. Characters might come up with an excellent plan that's completely different from the \"divide and conquer\" approach suggested above. If you think it could work, let it play out. Player creativity deserves to be rewarded.": "始终保持灵活性。角色可能会提出一个与上面建议的“分而治之”方法完全不同的绝妙计划。如果你认为这个计划可行，就让它发挥作用。玩家的创造力应该得到奖励。",
	"But don't let a weak or foolish plan succeed out of sympathy. At the very least, characters who blunder in this situation should be captured, tormented, and humiliated for a while before pulling off a daring escape.": "但不要因同情而让一个薄弱或愚蠢的计划成功。至少，在这种情况下犯错的角色应该被捕获、折磨和羞辱一段时间，然后才能成功地进行大胆的逃脱。",
	"Many areas of this level exist in both Midgard and a parallel, alternate dimension at the same time. A character with {@sense truesight} or under the effect of {@spell true seeing} magic sees both realities at the same time and can interact with both. This ability is vital to mitigating some of the dangers found here.": "这个层面的许多区域同时存在于米德加德和一个平行的、替代的维度中。一个拥有{@sense truesight}或者受到{@spell true seeing}魔法影响的角色可以同时看到两个现实并与两者互动。这种能力对于减轻这里的一些危险至关重要。",
	"The derro brew {@item potion of augmented reality|KPSC|potions of augmented reality} that allow them to see this alternate dimension. They also poison some of their weapons with a derivative of that potion, and one of its side effects is to bestow momentary {@sense truesight} on {@condition poisoned} creatures. Characters can learn about this three ways: by being struck by {@condition poisoned} weapons and having visions of an altered reality around them, by searching the derro village and discovering what they think are potions of true seeing, or by being given the potions by {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}. However they learn about the potions, it's your job to subtly encourage someone to drink one and discover the additional secrets around them.": "矮人魔酿造出一种酿酒{@item potion of augmented reality|KPSC|potions of augmented reality}，使他们能够看到这个替代维度。他们还用这种药物的衍生物毒害一些武器，其中一个副作用是赋予短暂的{@sense truesight} 给{@condition poisoned} 生物。角色可以通过三种方式了解到这一点：被矮人魔的武器击中并看到周围被改变的现实，搜查矮人魔村庄并发现他们认为是真实视觉药剂，或者被{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}赠送这种药剂。无论他们如何了解这些药剂，你的工作是巧妙地鼓励某人喝下一瓶并发现周围的额外秘密。",
	"If characters get their first glimpses of the parallel reality by being {@condition poisoned}, don't explain what's happening in clear terms. At first, they should have legitimate concerns over whether their senses are expanding and revealing an authentic, other reality to them, they're hallucinating, or they're losing their minds.": "如果角色们通过被{@condition poisoned}获得对平行现实的第一次瞥见，不要用清晰的术语解释发生了什么。起初，他们应该对自己的感官是否正在扩展并向他们展示一个真实的、另一个现实感到担忧，他们是在幻觉，还是他们正在失去理智。",
	"A rope ladder made of twisted fungus fiber drops down (from {@area Area 317|SC-317|x}) to the pile of debris in the southwest corner of this chamber. The debris pile is 5 feet high in the corner but slopes down to the floor. The bottom end of the ladder is anchored to heavy stones so it doesn't swing wildly when someone is climbing or descending, though it still moves enough to be unnerving to climb. If a creature on the ladder takes damage from an attack, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall. The DC equals the amount of damage taken.": "一条由扭曲的真菌纤维制成的绳梯从（{@area Area 317|SC-317|x}）垂下，到达这个房间西南角的碎石堆。角落里的碎石堆高5英尺，但倾斜至地板。梯子的底端固定在沉重的石头上，这样当有人爬上或下来时就不会摇摆得太厉害，尽管仍然会有足够的移动让人感到不安。如果梯子上的生物受到攻击伤害，那个生物必须成功进行一次力量豁免才能不摔下。豁免 DC 值等于受到的伤害量。",
	"The ladder is 80 feet long from the floor of the cavern to the floor of the stables above. The bottom 50 feet hangs through open space where a climber can be attacked with ranged weapons and spells and by flying creatures. The top 30 feet ascends through an 8-foot-diameter chimney where a climber is safe from most flying enemies but could still be targeted by ranged attacks from directly below.": "梯子从洞穴地板到上方马厩地板长80英尺。底部50英尺悬在开放空间中，攀登者可能会受到远程武器和法术以及飞行生物的攻击。顶部30英尺通过一个直径8英尺的烟囱上升，攀登者可在那里安全地避开大多数飞行敌人，但仍可能受到直接下方的远程攻击。",
	"The stones of the debris pile are loose and treacherous. Every creature that steps off the rope ladder onto the debris pile must make a successful {@dc 5} Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check or skid to the bottom of the pile amid a clatter of loose gravel. That noise draws the attention of {@dice 1d4} {@creature swarm of bats|MM|swarms of bats} in this chamber. The swarms must be dealt with quickly and quietly to keep the situation from rapidly getting out of hand. Use your best judgment here. If the characters act intelligently and decisively, whether to kill the swarming bats or to quickly conceal themselves, that should be sufficient. If they dither, shout, take conflicting actions, or cast loud, flashy spells such as {@spell thunderwave} or {@spell fireball}, unleash the cave at them.": "碎石堆的石头松动且危险。每个踏上绳梯离开堆积物堆的生物必须成功进行一次 {@dc 5} 敏捷 ({@skill Acrobatics}) 检定，否则会在松散的碎石声中滑到堆积物底部。这种噪音引起了这个房间里 {@dice 1d4} {@creature swarm of bats|MM|swarms of bats} 的注意。必须迅速而安静地处理这些虫群，以防局势迅速失控。在这里要谨慎判断。如果角色们表现聪明果断，无论是消灭蜂拥而至的蝙蝠还是迅速隐藏自己，都应该足够了。如果他们犹豫不决、大声喊叫、采取相互矛盾的行动，或者施放像 {@spell thunderwave} 或 {@spell fireball} 这样的响亮、花哨的法术，就向他们展示洞穴的力量。",
	"If anything larger than a pebble is dropped through the hole from the stables, the bats in this chamber become alert. Pebbles fall all the time and don't attract attention. Tin plates and unhooded lanterns on ropes absolutely do get noticed. Because the bats are clinging to the ceiling, they can't be seen by looking down from the stables.": "如果从马厩中的洞口掉落任何比鹅卵石更大的东西，这个房间里的蝙蝠会变得警觉。鹅卵石经常掉落，不会引起注意。但是悬挂在绳子上的锡盘和没有罩子的灯笼绝对会被注意到。因为蝙蝠紧贴着天花板，从马厩往下看是看不到它们的。",
	"This natural cave is higher than it is wide. The rope ladder you're on sways madly from side to side, although it must be anchored to something at the bottom or the swinging would be even worse.": "这个天然洞穴比宽度高。你站在的绳梯从一边摇摆到另一边，尽管它必须被固定在底部的某物上，否则摇摆会更糟糕。",
	"Of more immediate concern are the bats clinging to the ceiling of the cave. There are thousands—perhaps tens of thousands—of them, and the least noise could startle them into a frenzy.": "更紧要的是洞穴天花板上挂着的蝙蝠。它们有成千上万——也许有数万只——任何小声音都可能让它们陷入狂乱。",

Fortunately, the Large bats don't often enter this chamber because of the narrow openings. They can get in by crawling along the ceiling, but they'd rather not.": "这个洞穴里有二十只蝙蝠{@creature swarm of bats|MM|swarms of bats}。即使它们一起发起攻击，对六级冒险者来说并不是很危险，但是被战斗声音吸引来自{@area Area 402|SC-402|x}、{@area 403|SC-403|x}及更远处的东西要危险得多。幸运的是，大蝙蝠很少进入这个洞穴，因为洞口很窄。它们可以沿着天花板爬进来，但它们宁愿不这样做。",

	"This is the smaller of the two roosting chambers.

After ten or fifteen minutes, the derro and bats resume their attack with everything that's left of their force—and with any luck, the characters prevail by a narrow margin.": "这是对四名6级角色来说可能是一股压倒性的力量，这就是为什么这场战斗应该分成两个或更多波次。在最初的战斗中，将一半到三分之二的力量投向角色。当英雄们处于困境时，或者当怪物遭受到严重损失，比如{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}或{@creature Drakustanz|KPSC}的死亡时，怪物会撤退重新集结。这给了角色们一个机会施放治疗法术，喝药水，调整到更好的位置，甚至在他们受重伤时完全撤离这个层次。十到十五分钟后，矮人和蝙蝠会恢复他们的攻击，用他们剩下的力量——希望角色们能以微弱的优势取胜。",

Don't undercut the excitement just to adhere to the list. If the first wave is annihilated without putting any pressure on the characters, double it and try again.

The idol stands inside a pentagram that's deeply scribed into the platform.": "这个房间由南墙上的两个发光的火盆和从天花板中间悬挂的第三个火盆昏暗地照亮。 台阶通向一个5英尺高的平台，平台上有一个10英尺高的蝙蝠人形实体雕像。 它伸展开的手臂融入了横跨20英尺的翅膀。 驼背的躯干和蹲着的腿类似于人类，但凶猛、咆哮的脸却是纯粹的蝙蝠。 雕像立在一个深深刻在平台上的五角星内。",
	"The statue is clothed in a real kilt and girdle of silk, and it's draped in necklaces, bracelets, anklets, and armbands of gleaming gold, silver, and electrum. Its eyes are fiery red gems that glitter in the flickering light of the braziers. The wall behind the statue is blackened and scorched by fire.": "这座雕像穿着真正的苏格兰裙(kilt)和丝绸腰带(girdle)，身上挂满了闪闪发光的黄金、银和电金的项链、手镯、脚镯和臂环。它的眼睛是火红色的宝石，在火盆摇曳的光线中闪闪发光。雕像背后的墙壁被火烧得发黑。",
	"A character who makes a successful {@dc 18} Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check recognizes the statue as a portrayal of {@creature Camazotz, Demon Lord of Bats and Fire|ToB}. If the character has proficiency in {@skill Religion}, they also know Camazotz is among the most savage and hate-filled of the demon lords—no small claim. Its dominion extends over bats, vampires, and the deep, eternally lightless regions of the world. Association with bats, darkness, and undiluted evil account for the demon's appeal among derro.": "一个成功的{@dc 18}智力检定的角色认出这座雕像描绘的是{@creature Camazotz, Demon Lord of Bats and Fire|ToB}。如果角色精通{@skill Religion}，他们还会知道卡玛佐兹是最凶残和充满仇恨的魔王之一——这可不是小事。它的统治范围涵盖蝙蝠、吸血鬼和世界上深处、永远没有光明的地区。与蝙蝠、黑暗和纯粹邪恶的关联解释了这位恶魔在德罗中的吸引力。",
	"Any dwarf spots telltale signs the statue was carved by dwarves, not derro. The statue itself offers no clues why dwarves would do this.": "任何矮人都能看出这座雕像是由矮人雕刻的，而不是地精。雕像本身并没有提供任何线索，说明为什么矮人会这样做。",
	"Behind the statue, a narrow cleft in the wall extends through to the central cavern. There's enough room behind the statue for a Medium creature to squeeze between the statue and the wall. During rites, {@creature Drakustanz|KPSC} is trained to use his flame breath through this slot, which focuses the flames into a line instead of a cone. This is what characters witnessed when they first saw the cavern if you used the Delicate Balance description of {@area Area 403|SC-403|x}.": "在雕像后面，墙壁上的一个狭窄裂缝延伸通向中央洞穴。在雕像后面有足够的空间，可以让一个中等生物在雕像和墙之间挤过去。在仪式中，{@creature Drakustanz|KPSC} 被训练通过这个缝隙喷出火焰，将火焰聚焦成一条线而不是锥形。这就是角色们第一次看到洞穴时所见到的情景，如果你使用了{@area Area 403|SC-403|x}的《微妙平衡》描述。",
	"The jewelry adorning the statue consists of a gold gorget (1,000 gp), two gold bracelets (200 gp each), two electrum armbands (100 gp each), two silver anklets (75 gp each), a leather girdle with a silver badge (250 gp), and a silver earring (25 gp). The gems in its eyes are red garnets (100 gp each). The silver earring has the properties of a {@item ring of protection} (it counts as a ring even when worn in the ear). {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} is unaware the earring is magical.": "这座雕像上的珠宝包括一条黄金护颈（1,000 gp），两只黄金手镯（每只200 gp），两只电金臂环（每只100 gp），两只银脚镯（每只75 gp），一条带有银徽章的皮腰带（250 gp），和一只银耳环（25 gp）。它眼睛里的宝石是红色的石榴石（每颗100 gp）。银耳环具有一个{@item ring of protection}的属性（即使戴在耳朵上也算作戒指）。{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}并不知道这个耳环是有魔法的。",
	"By the time characters reach this chamber, they may have already killed all the bats and derro. Alternatively, {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} might decide to make a final stand here with {@creature Drakustanz|KPSC} and a few hand-picked derro pariahs. In that case, the statue provides them a magical boost. At the end of each round, the statue's gem eyes both flare brightly. One bestows 15 temporary hit points on one derro; the other inflicts 16 ({@damage 3d10}) fire or necrotic damage on one character of your choice. Camazotz prefers fire damage, but it uses necrotic if the target is resistant or immune to fire.": "当角色们到达这个房间时，他们可能已经杀死了所有的蝙蝠和德罗。或者，{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} 可能决定在这里与{@creature Drakustanz|KPSC} 和几个精心挑选的德罗贱民进行最后的对抗。在这种情况下，雕像会为他们提供魔法增益。每个回合结束时，雕像的宝石眼睛会同时闪耀。其中一个为一个德罗提供15点临时生命值；另一个对你选择的一个角色造成16点({@damage 3d10}) 火焰或死灵伤害。卡马索茨更喜欢火焰伤害，但如果目标对火焰有抗性或免疫，则使用死灵伤害。",
	"This is where {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} presents his proposition to the characters. Preferably, they'll follow his minions here freely, but bringing them in shackles and fetters doesn't change the situation significantly from his perspective. (Bullying, torment, bondage, and ultimatums are common in derro society, and {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} acts accordingly.)": "这是{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}向角色们提出他的建议的地方。最好是他的手下能够自由地带他们来这里，但是即使用脚镣和脚链带来他们，从他的角度来看，情况也不会有太大改变。(欺凌、折磨、束缚和最后通牒在德罗社会中很常见，{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}会相应地行动。)",
	"Again, the staging described here is a suggestion only. If you know your players will react better if {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} takes a different approach, follow your instinct.": "这里描述的分阶段过程仅供参考。如果你知道你的玩家在{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}采取不同方式时会有更好的反应，那就跟随你的直觉。",
	"{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} is cruelty and amorality personified, but he's also a canny judge of people and a skilled manipulator. (No one rises to leadership in a demonic cult through religious devotion alone.) He emphasizes his cruelty rather than masks it, because to derro cruelty is a feature of leadership. This cruelty isn't directed at the characters; it's reserved mostly for {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC} and somewhat for {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC} and her followers, who are portrayed as being under Imortra's sway. Whether the other derro serve Imortra willingly or out of fear should be kept vague. Fear is such a huge component of the derro's daily experience that they simply don't recognize much difference between doing something freely and doing it out of fear of punishment.": "{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}是残忍和无道德的化身，但他也是一个精明的人才评判者和熟练的操纵者。 (在一个恶魔教派中，没有人仅凭宗教虔诚就能升至领导地位。) 他强调自己的残忍而不是掩饰它，因为对derro来说，残忍是领导力的一个特征。 这种残忍并不是针对角色的；它主要是针对{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}，并在某种程度上也是针对{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}和她的追随者，他们被描绘为受到Imortra的影响。 其他derro是自愿为Imortra服务还是出于恐惧而服务应保持模糊不清。 恐惧是derro日常经历的一个重要组成部分，以至于他们根本就分不清自愿做某事和出于惩罚恐惧而做某事之间的区别。",
	"{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} explains the following points. This should be a roleplaying conversation, not a monologue. If the characters are captives, those who are obvious spellcasters might be kept gagged, but others won't be. If the party's leader and primary speaker is a spellcaster, that character could be ungagged but warned that there will be severe repercussions at the first sign of casting a spell. Two pariahs stand by with readied daggers to strike automatic critical hits if the spellcaster tries anything suspicious.": "{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}解释了以下几点。这应该是一个角色扮演的对话，而不是独白。如果角色被囚禁，那些明显是法术施放者的人可能会被堵嘴，但其他人不会。如果队伍的领袖和主要发言人是一个法术施放者，那个角色可能会被解开口罩，但会被警告，一旦发现施法的迹象，将会受到严厉惩罚。两个贱民手持匕首准备好随时发动自动暴击，以防法术施放者有任何可疑行为。",
	"The derro came here via the Black River long ago. He can't say how long ago because in eternal darkness, they don't reckon time by days, months, or years. It was during the time when sinful surface dwarves dwelled in the halls above. {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} is glad they're dead.": "德罗(Derro)很久以前通过黑河来到这里。他无法说多久以前，因为在永恒的黑暗中，他们不以天、月或年来计算时间。那是在邪恶的地表矮人居住在上面大厅的时候。{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} 很高兴他们已经死了。",
	"{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC} is an elf who rules these of caverns. She is a powerful conjurer of Abyssal creatures, but she doesn't venerate or even respect Camazotz.": "{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC} 是一个精灵，统治着这些洞穴。她是深渊生物的强大召唤师，但她并不崇拜甚至尊重卡马佐特 (Camazotz)。",
	"Imortra serves a being that dwells somewhere beneath them on the banks of the Black River, named {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}. {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} has never seen Gellert and fears to do so.": "伊莫特拉侍奉着一位居住在黑河岸边某处的存在，名为{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}。{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}从未见过盖勒特，也害怕见到他。",
	"Imortra keeps a handful of humans, elves, dwarves, and other weak surface creatures captive. They work as servants and are occasionally offered as sacrifices to her diabolic masters and mentors.": "伊莫特拉（Imortra）囚禁了一些人类、精灵、矮人和其他弱小的地表生物。他们被迫当仆人，有时还会被作为祭品献给她邪恶的主人和导师。",
	"Another derro leader, {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}, lives with her followers in a village a short distance away. They farm and hunt in the caverns, occasionally raid the surface for captives, and do Imortra's bidding like slaves. They must be punished, but not until after Imortra is dealt with. They serve Imortra unwillingly and could be useful allies against her; why not let them bear the brunt of the inevitable casualties?": "另一位矮人领袖，{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}，与她的追随者一起生活在离这里不远的村庄里。他们在洞穴里耕种和狩猎，偶尔袭击地表，抓获俘虏，并像奴隶一样听从伊莫特拉的命令。他们必须受到惩罚，但要等到伊莫特拉被处理之后。他们不情愿地侍奉伊莫特拉，可能成为对抗她的有用盟友；为什么不让他们承担不可避免的伤亡呢？",
	"The characters should carry a message of alliance to {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}. With all the derros together combined with the powerful outsiders, they should be able to bring down Imortra.": "这些角色应该携带一条联盟信息给{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}。所有德洛一起与强大的外来者结合，他们应该能够击败伊莫特拉(Imortra)。",
	"If characters ask about the nearby steps ({@area Area 411|SC-411|x}), {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} stresses that they are extraordinarily dangerous. The steps descend to the Black River and they're how he and the other derro came to this cavern when they arrived. That was before {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} moved in and placed guardians on them. No one who descends those steps has returned since Gellert and Imortra arrived. He's being entirely truthful about this; all the derro are terrified of the steps and perform various superstitious rituals whenever they pass by (tossing a white pebble down the passage, wiping some spit on the rock wall, crawling on hands and knees, plucking out a few strands of hair, etc.). {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} promises to show characters a safer way to descend ({@area Area 416|SC-416|x}) if they help him overthrow Imortra and {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}, while assuring them they'll never find it on their own.": "如果角色询问附近的阶梯({@area Area 411|SC-411|x})，{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}强调这些阶梯异常危险。这些阶梯通往黑河，是他和其他德罗来到这个洞穴时所走的路。那是在{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}搬进来并在那里放置守卫之前。自从格勒特和伊莫特拉到来后，没有一个下过那些阶梯的人回来过。他完全诚实地讲述这一切；所有的德罗都对这些阶梯感到恐惧，并在经过时进行各种迷信仪式（往通道里扔一块白色小石头，在岩壁上抹一些口水，跪在地上匍匐前进，拔下几根头发等）。{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}承诺如果角色帮助他推翻伊莫特拉和{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}，他会向角色展示一条更安全的下降方式({@area Area 416|SC-416|x})，同时向他们保证他们自己永远也找不到这条路。",
	"Do your best to sell this proposition. If nothing else, characters should realize they have little to lose by agreeing for now so they can explore other parts of the cave under the derro's safe passage and assess the larger situation before diving blindly into a potentially lethal battle.": "尽力推销这个提议。如果没有其他选择，角色们应该意识到现在同意这个提议他们几乎没有什么损失，这样他们就可以在德罗(Derro)提供的安全通道下探索洞穴的其他部分，并在盲目卷入可能致命战斗之前评估更大的情况。",
	"If characters were captured, they might have been force-fed lichen tea while {@condition unconscious} to weaken their resistance to {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}'s arguments. In this case, they must make {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throws to avoid being {@condition charmed} by {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}. Use this as a last resort, however; events will unfold much more smoothly if characters cooperate for their own reasons.": "如果角色被捕获，他们可能会被强迫喝苔藓茶，同时被 {@condition unconscious}，以削弱他们对 {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} 论点的抵抗力。在这种情况下，他们必须进行 {@dc 15} 感知豁免投掷来避免被 {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} 所 {@condition charmed}。然而，将此作为最后手段；如果角色出于自己的原因合作，事件将会更顺利地展开。",
	"These stairs make four ninety-degree left turns as they descend and eventually open onto Gellert's Landing ({@area Area 501|SC-501|x}).": "这些楼梯在下降时会转四次九十度向左，最终通往盖勒特着陆点（Gellert's Landing {@area Area 501|SC-501|x}）。",
	"This rock face is 20 feet high. The derro carved fingerholds and toeholds into it for their use, but they're cleverly hidden in the natural folds of the rock. Climbing up this shelf takes a successful {@dc 16} Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. If someone's ability check result is 20 or higher, they discover the climbing aids. The DC is lowered to 10 for characters using the holds to ascend or descend.": "这块岩壁高20英尺。德罗族人在上面雕刻了手指和脚趾的支撑点，但它们被巧妙地隐藏在岩石的自然褶皱中。攀爬这个搁板需要成功的{@dc 16}力量检定。如果有人的能力检定结果达到20或更高，他们会发现这些攀爬辅助装置。对于使用这些支撑点上升或下降的角色，DC降低到10。",
	"Derro from either faction don't pursue characters past this point, but they remain on high alert nearby lest the intruders return.": "无论是哪个派别的矮人(Derro)都不会追击角色到这个地方，但他们会保持高度警惕，以防闯入者返回。",
	"This rock face is the boundary between {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}'s territory and {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}'s territory. The derro cross it frequently.": "这块岩石表面是{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}领土和{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}领土的分界线。德罗经常穿越它。",
	"This cavern is the site of significant overlap between the characters' reality and a similar but not identical alternate dimension. A {@spell true seeing} spell or potion allows a character to see and interact with both dimensions.": "这个洞穴是角色现实世界和一个类似但不完全相同的另一个维度之间重要重叠的地点。一种{@spell true seeing}法术或药水可以让角色看到并与两个维度互动。",
	"Even if characters are being escorted by derro pariahs who immediately guide them into the fungus farm ({@area Area 414|SC-414|x}), they get a look into this chamber as they pass nearby. Since they almost certainly haven't cast {@spell true seeing} and probably haven't been affected by weapons coated in {@item potion of augmented reality|KPSC|potions of augmented reality} {@homebrew |(see appendix)} yet, they see the chamber as empty.": "即使角色被德罗贱民护送，立即被引导进入真菌农场({@area Area 414|SC-414|x})，当他们经过附近时，他们可以看到这个房间。由于他们几乎肯定还没有施放{@spell true seeing}，而且很可能还没有受到涂有{@item potion of augmented reality|KPSC|potions of augmented reality}{@homebrew |(see appendix)}的武器的影响，他们认为这个房间是空的。",
	"Without {@spell true seeing}, characters get the following description.": "没有{@spell true seeing}，角色会得到以下描述。",
	"This high-ceilinged cavern glows with an unearthly light in hues of purple. The light emanates from immense crystals growing around the base of the walls. Some of these crystals are as large as a person, but the walls are covered with much smaller versions, and the floor is strewn with purple shards.": "这个高高的洞穴散发着一种紫色的超自然光芒。这种光芒来自于巨大的水晶在墙壁的基座周围生长。一些水晶有人那么大，但墙壁上覆盖着更小的版本，地板上散落着紫色碎片。",
	"On the western and southern walls, you see openings near the roof of the cavern that may be passages leading away.": "在洞穴的西墙和南墙上，你看到靠近屋顶的开口，可能是通往其他地方的通道。",
	"The crystals are literally \"not of this world.\" Their alien substance is anathema to matter from the Prime plane. If someone enters the chamber, the soles of their footgear dissolve in 2 rounds. After that, they take 3 ({@damage 1d6}) force damage at the start of their turn as long as their flesh is in contact with the floor. The same thing happens to anyone who climbs the wall, and any rope lowered down the wall frays and breaks within seconds. Climbing characters are also subject to attacks from the crystalline devils, described later in this section. It's not impossible for characters to get through this chamber without {@spell true seeing}, but it requires tremendous creativity.": "这些水晶实际上“非世间所有”。它们的外星物质对来自原位面的物质是忌讳的。如果有人进入这个房间，他们鞋底会在2回合内溶解。之后，只要他们的肉体与地板接触，他们在每个回合开始时会受到3({@damage 1d6})力量伤害。任何试图攀爬墙壁的人都会遭遇同样的情况，而任何从墙上垂下的绳索都会在几秒内磨损断裂。攀爬的角色还会受到后面本节中描述的水晶恶魔的攻击。角色们不是不可能在没有{@spell true seeing}的情况下通过这个房间，但这需要极大的创造力。",
	"Here's what characters see with {@spell true seeing} (show the players the {@area Point-of-View illustration|SC-413-POV|x} on the facing page):": "这是角色们看到的 {@spell true seeing}（在对面页上展示给玩家们看 {@area Point-of-View illustration|SC-413-POV|x}）:",
	"This high-ceilinged cavern glows with an unearthly light in hues of purple. Six crystal pillars extend from floor to ceiling, and the pillars support two crystal platforms shaped like ovals. One platform is 15 feet above the floor, the other is 15 feet above that. Curving ramps extend from the ground to the lower platform and from the lower to the higher one.": "这个高高的洞穴散发着一种紫色的超自然光芒。六根水晶柱从地板延伸到天花板，支撑着两个椭圆形水晶平台。一个平台离地面15英尺高，另一个在其上方15英尺处。从地面延伸到下层平台的是弯曲的坡道，从下层到上层的是另一条坡道。",
	"Both platforms have an open space at their center. A pillar of insubstantial blue light extends from floor to ceiling through the openings. Nodules of light move upward through the blue columns, rising from the floor and disappearing into the ceiling. Their motion seems to be accompanied by the sound of singing or chanting that emanates from the nodules themselves.": "两个平台中央都有一个开放的空间。一根由地板延伸至天花板的虚幻蓝光柱贯穿其中。光的结节沿着蓝色柱向上移动，从地板上升，消失在天花板中。它们的运动似乎伴随着从结节本身发出的歌唱或吟唱声。",
	"Two identical creatures stand motionless on the platforms, one on each level. They're humanoid and human-sized, but they appear to be equal parts flesh and purple crystal.": "两个相同的生物站在平台上一动不动，每个级别一个。它们是人形的，和人类一样大小，但它们似乎是肉体和紫色水晶的等量部分。",
	"The two creatures are {@creature crystalline devil|ToB|crystalline devils} (Tome of Beasts). They can see and harm the characters regardless of whether the characters see them. The devils' job is to stop intruders from moving through the chamber. Unless characters used potions of augmented reality or cast {@spell true seeing}, the {@creature crystalline devil|ToB|crystalline devils} are permanently {@condition invisible} to them. If a fight breaks out, handle it as if the characters are fighting permanently {@condition invisible} foes. Not even spells such as {@spell faerie fire} break the devils' invisibility; technically, they don't even exist in the same reality, but they can reach into the characters' dimension at will to wreak havoc. Use descriptions like \"crystalline claws appear from nowhere to rake across your back, then instantly disappear again into nothingness\" to describe what the characters see.": "这两个生物是{@creature crystalline devil|ToB|crystalline devils}（野兽之书）。无论角色是否看到它们，它们都能看到并伤害角色。恶魔的任务是阻止闯入者通过房间。除非角色使用增强现实药水或施放{@spell true seeing}，否则{@creature crystalline devil|ToB|crystalline devils}对他们永久不可见。如果发生战斗，处理方式就像角色在与永久不可见的敌人战斗一样。即使是像{@spell faerie fire}这样的法术也无法打破恶魔的隐形；从技术上讲，它们甚至不在同一个现实中存在，但它们可以随意伸手进入角色的维度制造混乱。使用描述比如“晶莹的爪子从虚空中出现，划过你的背部，然后瞬间又消失在虚无中”来描述角色所看到的情景。",
	"If characters can see the crystal platforms, they can walk on them. The platforms are safe to touch, unlike the crystal-strewn floor of the chamber.": "如果角色能看到水晶平台，他们可以走在上面。这些平台是安全的，可以触摸，不像室内铺满水晶的地板那样危险。",
	"The blue-light-filled holes at the center of the platforms are a different story. These are open conduits of ley-line energy flowing upward from the Black River. Mortal flesh was never meant to interact with such energy. If a character touches the blue light in any way, whether experimentally or because they were pushed into it, roll {@dice 1d6} on the {@table Blue Energy|KPSC} table.": "平台中心的蓝光充盈孔洞则是另一回事。这些是从黑河向上流动的灵脉能量的开放导管。凡人肉体从未意味着与这种能量互动。如果角色以任何方式接触蓝光，无论是实验性的还是被推入其中，就在{@table Blue Energy|KPSC}表上投掷{@dice 1d6}。",
	"Imortra and her devils, if confronted by a manticore, a watery humanoid, or a swirl of lights, recognize instantly that they're seeing someone transformed by the column of ley energy. They assume the person is an intruder to be captured or killed, since the derro all know better than to touch the column of blue light.": "当伊莫特拉(Imortra)和她的恶魔们遭遇狮鹫(Manticore)、水中人(watery humanoid)或光影漩涡(swirl of lights)时，他们立刻意识到这些人是被莱能量柱转化的。他们假定这些人是入侵者，需要被捕获或杀死，因为德罗(Derro)都知道不要触碰那道蓝光。",
	"For the sake of preserving some semblance of balance, the {@creature crystalline devil|ToB|crystalline devils} don't team up against the characters if the devils can't be seen. You might even eliminate one devil entirely or decide it spends this battle lying on the ground in gem form. In that case, it can pop back into devil form later to cause problems for the characters if they return to this chamber, thinking it's safe. If the devils can be seen, then characters have a better idea what they're up against, and you can use both in combat. The characters can decide for themselves whether that makes for a fair fight.": "为了保持某种平衡，如果恶魔无法被看见，{@creature crystalline devil|ToB|crystalline devils}不会联合起来对抗角色。你甚至可以完全消灭一个恶魔，或者决定它在这场战斗中躺在地上以宝石形式存在。在这种情况下，如果角色回到这个房间，认为这里是安全的，那么它可以随后恢复成恶魔形态来给角色制造麻烦。如果恶魔可以被看见，那么角色们会更清楚他们面对的是什么，你可以在战斗中同时使用两者。角色们可以自行决定这是否构成了一场公平的战斗。",
	"If characters are accompanied by derro guides when they enter this chamber, the {@creature crystalline devil|ToB|crystalline devils} assume they're allies. That remains true until Imortra is attacked; after that, the devils know they're facing an uprising.": "如果角色在进入这个房间时被德洛向导陪同，{@creature crystalline devil|ToB|crystalline devils}会认为他们是盟友。直到伊莫特拉受到攻击之前，这种情况仍然成立；之后，恶魔们就知道他们面对的是一场起义。",
	"{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}'s derro do most of their fungus farming here. They also hunt the various cave vermin that live among the fungi. Depending on the situation, you can add two to six derro dements to the area description.": "{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}的矮人疯子在这里进行大部分的蘑菇种植。他们还狩猎生活在蘑菇中的各种洞穴害虫。根据情况，你可以在区域描述中增加两到六个矮人疯子。",
	"This cavern contains fungi of many varieties, but two predominate: a tall, orange-capped variety and a shorter, white-capped variety. Both are enormous.": "这个洞穴里长满了各种类型的真菌，但有两种占主导地位：一种是高大的橙色帽子，另一种是较矮的白色帽子。它们都非常巨大。",
	"A relatively clear path winds through the middle of the cavern, implying these fungi are tended and harvested purposefully.": "一个相对清晰的路径蜿蜒穿过洞穴中央，暗示这些真菌是经过精心照料和有目的地收获的。",
	"Most of the food for everyone on this level of the citadel comes from this farm: the derro live on fungus and cave vermin, and the captives subsist on the derro's cast-offs. Even Imortra eats some of the more appetizing fungi, but most of her supplies are brought in from outside. In addition, most of the ingredients that go into {@item potion of augmented reality|KPSC|potions of augmented reality} come from this cavern.": "这座城堡这一层大部分人的食物都来自这个农场：德罗人靠真菌和洞穴害虫为生，而俘虏们则靠德罗人不要的食物维持生计。即使伊莫特拉也吃一些更可口的真菌，但她的大部分食物都是从外面运进来的。此外，{@item potion of augmented reality|KPSC|potions of augmented reality} 中大部分食材也来自这个洞穴。",
	"Because it's vital to their survival, the derro dements are more concerned about this chamber than any other. They try to steer combat away from this cavern lest their food supply is incinerated by spells or trampled by enemies.": "由于这对他们的生存至关重要，德罗疯子们比其他任何事情都更关心这个房间。他们试图将战斗引开这个洞穴，以免他们的食物被法术焚烧或被敌人践踏。(derro dements)。",
	"If a melee breaks out in this chamber and lasts more than 1 round, spores, toxins, and molds are released into the chamber by damaged fungi. The derro are immune and unaffected, but beginning on the second round of battle, every character must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn. The DC equals 12 initially and increases by 1 each round. If the saving throw succeeds, there's no effect on that character this round.

She hopes the characters will pursue immediately instead of searching this cavern right away. If the characters don't pursue, they'll be continually harassed from the steps and by {@creature Chupacabra|CCodex|chupacabras} (Creature Codex) lunging at them from behind. Once the characters chase their harassers into {@area Area 415|SC-415|x}, the derro hidden here are to advance and attack enemies from behind; ideally, those will be poorly armored spellcasters and archers. Because they're in prepared hiding spots, the derro dements have advantage on their Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks to hide. Furthermore, characters who don't spend several minutes searching the chamber or at least devote an action to making a {@skill Perception} check during combat have little chance to spot the well-concealed derro in their own garden.": "一旦德罗族人警戒起来（在中央洞穴的一场大战之后的任何时候），{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}会派哨兵守卫这个洞穴以防入侵。她更希望激烈的战斗发生在更具防御性的村庄({@area Area 415|SC-415|x})周围，但两到四个德罗疯子藏在茂密的真菌中。{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}指示哨兵从通往村庄的台阶上发动几次攻击，然后撤退。她希望角色们会立即追击，而不是立即搜查这个洞穴。如果角色们不追击，他们将不断受到来自台阶和{@creature Chupacabra|CCodex|chupacabras}（生物图鉴）从背后扑向他们的骚扰。一旦角色们追赶骚扰者进入{@area Area 415|SC-415|x}，这里隐藏的德罗将前进并从背后攻击敌人；理想情况下，这些敌人将是装甲较差的法师和弓箭手。由于他们处于准备好的隐藏地点，德罗疯子在进行敏捷度检定时具有优势({@skill Stealth})。此外，那些没有花费几分钟搜索房间或至少在战斗中投入一个行动进行{@skill Perception}检定的角色几乎没有机会发现自己花园中隐藏的德罗。",
	"If characters are escorted here by derro pariah, there isn't a fight unless the characters start it. After Imortra is dealt with and the alliance starts falling apart, the notes under Into the Fray apply equally here.": "如果角色被(de)狂狼人(pariah)护送到这里，除非角色发动攻击，否则不会发生战斗。在处理完伊莫特拉(Imortra)并且联盟开始瓦解后，\"激战陷阵(Into the Fray)\"下的注释同样适用于这里。",

	"The derro village sits atop a 10-foot-high ledge accessible via a stone ladder cut into the south end of the rock face. It's impossible to climb up the ladder all the way onto the ledge if an enemy occupies the space at the top of the ladder. A creature on the ladder can fight only with a one-handed weapon; the other hand must hang onto a handhold so the creature doesn't fall. Because a creature hanging onto the stone ladder can't easily dodge or defend itself, an enemy on the ledge has advantage on melee attacks against it.": "derro村庄坐落在一个10英尺高的悬崖上，通过切入岩石南端的石梯可达。如果敌人占据梯子顶部的空间，就不可能完全爬上梯子到达悬崖上。梯子上的生物只能用单手武器战斗；另一只手必须抓住一个扶手，以免生物摔落。因为一个生物抓住石梯时不能轻易躲避或自卫，站在悬崖上的敌人对它进行近战攻击时具有优势。",
	"The derro village sits atop a 10-foot ledge accessible only by a narrow ladder; it would be easy to defend against foes who can't fly or cast spells. The village consists of a half-dozen stone huts huddled around a few fire pits. Strips of fungus and the peeled carcasses of various cave vermin hang from racks, drying in the smoky cavern air. The cavern stinks of burning fungus, rotting meat, and unwashed bodies packed into a too-confined living space.": "derro（德洛(Derro)）村庄坐落在一个10英尺高的悬崖上，只能通过一条狭窄的梯子进入；对于那些不能飞行或施法的敌人来说，防御起来会很容易。村庄由半打石头小屋围绕着几个火坑而建。一些真菌条和各种洞穴害虫的剥皮尸体被挂在架子上，正在烟雾弥漫的洞穴空气中晾干。洞穴里弥漫着燃烧真菌、腐烂肉体和未洗涤的身体散发出的恶臭，这些身体挤在一个过于狭小的生活空间里。",
	"Although the cavern stinks, it's cleaner than characters might expect. The derro dump most of their trash and waste under the crystal platforms ({@area Area 413|SC-413|x}), where it's gradually disintegrated by the other-dimensional crystals scattered across the floor.": "尽管洞穴很臭，但比角色们预期的要干净。德洛族把大部分垃圾和废物倒在水晶平台({@area Area 413|SC-413|x})下，那里逐渐被散布在地板上的其他维度水晶分解。",
	"Characters who experience {@spell true seeing} in this cavern see the same basic layout, but the cavern walls are carved into the decaying facades of ancient buildings whose interiors were cut into the stone. The creatures that carved the buildings were neither derro nor human. None of the angles are square or regular; everything seems based on irregular polygons with bases that are smaller than their tops. The effect is disorienting and unsettling; if a character sees it for the first time while {@condition frightened}, the character uses all their movement and actions to flee the cavern as quickly as they can and stay out until they're no longer {@condition frightened}. Once the character recovers, they don't need to flee the cavern again as a result of being {@condition frightened}. The interiors of the buildings are collapsed or filled with rubbish; it's impossible to move more than a few steps inside.": "在这个洞穴中经历{@spell true seeing}的角色看到的是相同的基本布局，但洞穴的墙壁被雕刻成古老建筑的腐烂外观，这些建筑的内部被切割在石头中。雕刻建筑的生物既不是德罗族也不是人类。没有一个角是直角或规则的；一切似乎都基于底部比顶部小的不规则多边形。这种效果让人感到迷失和不安；如果一个角色在{@condition frightened}时第一次看到它，角色会利用所有的移动和动作尽快逃离洞穴，并且在不再{@condition frightened}为止保持远离。一旦角色恢复过来，他们就不需要因为变成{@condition frightened}而再次逃离洞穴。建筑物的内部已经坍塌或者充满垃圾；根本无法在里面走动几步。",

	"As in the bat cavern, this opposing force is only a suggestion for the minimum opposition. You must make adjustments to suit your players and their characters. Don't allow the fight to be too easy. In fact, you're better off erring on the side of too difficult, because characters can retreat, regain their strength, and attack again, while the derro can only grow weaker with each assault. Unlike the bat cavern, it's difficult to add more derro after the first assault unless they arrive as reinforcements from {@area Area 416|SC-416|x}. Don't be reluctant to challenge the characters or the players with more than they can handle. Adversity forces them to get creative.": "就像蝙蝠洞一样，这个对立力量只是对最低对抗的建议。你必须做出调整以适应你的玩家和他们的角色。不要让战斗变得太容易。事实上，最好是偏向困难一些，因为角色可以撤退，恢复体力，然后再次进攻，而derro每次攻击都会变得更弱。与蝙蝠洞不同的是，在第一次攻击后很难再添加更多的derro，除非它们作为来自{@area Area 416|SC-416|x}的增援到达。不要犹豫挑战角色或玩家超出他们所能承受的范围。逆境迫使他们变得更有创造力。",
	"Characters are escorted here by a team of derro pariahs. Derro from both groups go through some incomprehensible rituals of greeting: screeching like bats, jumping up and down while spitting on each other's feet, rubbing ashes in their hair, knocking their foreheads together. After the formalities are out of the way, the derro pariahs explain why they've come and why they've brought strangers with them. Dements interrupt occasionally to ask questions.

She wears adornments consisting of more bones, mummified rodents and vermin, and teeth and claws of every imaginable—and unimaginable—kind. Her hair is plaited into braids so long they would drag on the stone floor, but two cringing derro who follow behind her hold up the braids to keep them off the ground. A sheathed scimitar with telltale Magdar stylings on the hilt is shoved through her sash, and she waves a corkscrew staff made from bones, leather, and twisted fungus stalks.": "当德罗女人走到高高的悬崖边缘时，所有的德罗，甚至蝙蝠教徒，都安静下来。她的衣服是一团缝在一起的皮肤、骨头和沾满鲜血的衣服，都是从地表居民那里拿来的。她身上装饰着更多的骨头、干尸鼠和害虫，以及各种各样——甚至是难以想象的——牙齿和爪子。她的头发编成长长的辫子，长到会拖在石头地板上，但跟在她身后的两个畏缩的德罗举起辫子，使其不沾地。一把插在腰带上的带有麦格达风格的剑鞘，她挥舞着一个由骨头、皮革和扭曲的真菌茎制成的螺旋杖。",
	"{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC} stands on the ledge and appraises the characters silently for about 30 seconds before signaling with her staff that they should be allowed up.

No one can be surprised here, because everyone involved expects this to erupt into a bloodbath.": "这场对话将以一场战斗结束；重要的是谁先开始。如果角色们做了正确的事情，他们可以开始战斗，或者，如果他们不采取行动，他们的德罗“盟友”会开始。如果在你的估计中，角色们做了足够多的错误事情，伊莫特拉会厌倦伪装，她会开始战斗。无论是角色、德罗还是伊莫特拉开始战斗，都要投两次先攻骰，并使用更高的结果。对于伊莫特拉和她的手下，使用最好的修正值，即{@skillCheck initiative 4}（{@creature lich hound|ToB}）。这里没有人会被偷袭，因为所有参与者都预料到这将演变成一场血腥冲突。",
	"Even if a derro throws the first punch, the rest don't stick around for the slaughter. They flee at the first opportunity. Imortra and her allies ignore the derro, assuming they can be punished later. The characters are the immediate threat, and all effort is focused on destroying them.": "即使一个德罗(Derro)先下手，其他人也不会留下来等待屠杀。他们会在第一个机会就逃走。伊莫特拉(Imortra)和她的盟友们会无视德罗，认为可以稍后惩罚他们。角色们是眼前的威胁，所有的努力都集中在摧毁他们身上。",
	"As with the other fights on this level, be ready to strengthen or weaken the enemy force here for the sake of staging the most dramatic battle. Your options include adding more devils or mindrot thralls, leaving some out, or having Imortra withdraw from the fight when she takes a certain amount of damage. If Imortra withdraws, she either barricades herself inside her chamber ({@area Area 418|SC-418|x}) or uses the {@spell teleportation circle} ({@area Area 417|SC-417|x}) to escape to regions unknown.": "与这一级别上的其他战斗一样，为了上演最激烈的战斗，请准备好加强或削弱敌人力量。你可以选择增加更多的恶魔或心灵腐蚀者，留下一些，或者当伊莫特拉受到一定伤害时退出战斗。如果伊莫特拉撤退，她要么将自己困在她的房间内（{@area Area 418|SC-418|x}），要么使用{@spell teleportation circle}（{@area Area 417|SC-417|x}）逃往未知的地区。",
	"Assuming characters win the battle, they're left with the question of what to do about the NPC captives who survived. There were eleven captives: five humans, two dwarves, a gnome, a halfling, and two elfmarked. One of the humans is a {@creature priest}, two are {@creature bandit|MM|bandits}, and one elfmarked is a {@creature scout}. All the others are {@creature commoner|MM|commoners}. All the NPCs have five levels of {@condition exhaustion}.": "假设角色们赢得了战斗，他们面临着如何处理幸存的NPC俘虏的问题。共有十一个俘虏：五名人类、两名矮人、一名侏儒、一名半身人和两名精灵印记者。其中一名人类是{@creature priest}，两名是{@creature bandit|MM|bandits}，一名精灵印记者是{@creature scout}。其他所有人都是{@creature commoner|MM|commoners}。所有NPC都有五级的{@condition exhaustion}。",
	"The characters' first problem in this regard is the derro (who return as soon as the battle is over) want to execute the captives out of hand. They're too weak to be useful; it's better to capture healthy ones. {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC} can be threatened or intimidated into sparing the prisoners, but unless they're kept under guard, derro eventually slip in and start murdering them, amid much terrified screaming.": "在这方面，角色们首先遇到的问题是derro（战斗结束后立即返回）想要立即处决俘虏。他们太虚弱了，无法派上用场；捕获健康的俘虏更为明智。{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}可以被威胁或恐吓以放过俘虏，但除非他们被看管，否则derro最终会悄悄溜进来并开始屠杀他们，引发大量恐慌的尖叫声。",
	"Getting the prisoners out of the citadel the way the characters came in will be arduous in their sick and weak condition. None of them can climb the rope ladder on their own. They can be evacuated this way, but it takes days, and each NPC has a {@dice 1d3|one-in-three} chance of dying from the exertion before they get back to Redtower.": "以角色进入的方式将囚犯从城堡中解救出来，在他们生病和虚弱的状态下将是艰巨的任务。他们中没有人能够独自爬上绳梯。他们可以通过这种方式被疏散，但这需要数天的时间，每个NPC在回到红塔之前有{@dice 1d3|one-in-three}的几率因过度劳累而死亡。",
	"The better solution is to teleport out using the {@item Spell Scroll (5th Level)|DMG|spell scroll} of {@spell teleportation circle} from {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}'s belongings or the skull circle in {@area Area 417|SC-417|x}. With the scroll, the caster can bring up to seven other creatures along, which is why allowing four of the NPCs to be killed during the battle might be a favor to the characters. Alternatively, if characters experiment with the skull circle in {@area Area 417|SC-417|x} and figure out how it operates, they can use it to teleport everyone back to town.": "更好的解决方案是使用{@item Spell Scroll (5th Level)|DMG|spell scroll}从{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}的物品中或者{@area Area 417|SC-417|x}中的骷髅圈传送出去。使用卷轴，施法者可以带着其他七个生物一起传送，这就是为什么在战斗中允许四个NPC被杀可能对角色有利的原因。或者，如果角色尝试使用{@area Area 417|SC-417|x}中的骷髅圈并弄清楚它的操作方式，他们可以用它将所有人传送回镇上。",
	"Finally, there's the question of the remaining derro. Both {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC} and {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} intend to use the characters to wipe out the other band of derro the same way they used them to wipe out Imortra. Once that's accomplished, they betray the characters and try to kill them, probably by drugging or poisoning their food. The \"alliance\" can fall apart several ways.": "最后，还有剩下的德罗问题。{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}和{@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC}都打算利用这些角色来消灭另一群德罗，就像他们用来消灭伊莫特拉一样。一旦完成这个目标，他们会背叛这些角色，并试图杀死他们，可能是通过下药或毒害他们的食物。这种“联盟”可能会以几种方式瓦解。",
	"Characters might decide they've tolerated the derro long enough when they start murdering prisoners.": "当角色开始谋杀囚犯时，他们可能会决定已经容忍德罗族人够久了。",
	"Characters might rebel at the thought of callously betraying former allies, even evil ones.": "角色可能会因为冷酷背叛以前的盟友，即使是邪恶的，而产生反抗的想法。",
	"If characters' {@item potion of augmented reality|KPSC|potions of augmented reality} wear off before they're ready to head down to Level 5 (almost guaranteed if much time is spent helping the prisoners), the passage from {@area Area 416|SC-416|x} becomes unavailable. {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC} refuses to provide more potions unless characters meet her ever-increasing demands such as to kill all the cultists, bring her {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} as a slave (she's still angry about Imortra being killed instead of captured), or draw her a map of Redtower's defenses.": "如果角色的{@item potion of augmented reality|KPSC|potions of augmented reality}在他们准备前往5级之前就耗尽了（如果花了很多时间帮助囚犯，几乎是肯定的），那么从{@area Area 416|SC-416|x}的通道将不再可用。{@creature Kurgorom|KPSC}拒绝提供更多药水，除非角色满足她不断增加的要求，比如杀死所有异教徒，把{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}带来当奴隶（她仍然对伊莫特拉被杀而不是被俘感到愤怒），或者为她绘制一张红塔防御地图。",
	"Exactly how those events unfold is left to you and the players. As always, reward creativity and err on the side of increased drama and adventure.": "这些事件的发展完全取决于你和玩家。一如既往，奖励创造力，倾向于增加戏剧性和冒险性。",
	"The 15-foot skull inlaid into the floor serves a dual purpose as both a magic (conjuring) circle and a {@spell teleportation circle}. The circle is surrounded by four braziers. They're unlit but primed for lighting; any flame catches and ignites a brazier. Once lit, a brazier burns for 1 hour, until it's smothered, or until it's extinguished with {@spell prestidigitation} or comparable magics.": "地板上嵌入的15英尺头骨具有双重作用，既是一个魔法（召唤）阵，也是一个{@spell teleportation circle}。阵中被四个火盆环绕。它们没有点燃，但已准备好点燃；任何火焰接触都会点燃火盆。一旦点燃，火盆会燃烧1小时，直到被扑灭，或者用{@spell prestidigitation}或类似的魔法扑灭。",
	"At five places around this chamber, the walls are carved with 5-foot-high faces whose lower portions sprout what could be snakes, or tentacles, or some other twisting, ropelike growths. The faces could represent bearded devils or tentacled horrors of the deep underearth; the carvings are done in a stylized manner that doesn't lend itself to easy identification. Certain creatures can launch attacks through these faces while they're inside the skull circle, as described here.": "在这个房间的五个地方，墙壁上雕刻着五英尺高的脸，脸的下部长出可能是蛇、触手或其他扭曲的绳状生长物。这些脸可能代表有胡须的恶魔或深渊地底的触手恐怖；雕刻以一种风格化的方式完成，不容易被识别。某些生物可以通过这些脸发动攻击，当它们在头骨圈内时，就像这里描述的那样。",
	"Lighting the braziers in different combinations and arrangements causes the inlaid skull to have different effects. The pattern can function as a limited type of {@spell teleportation circle} or as a {@spell magic circle}. All these properties can be discovered through trial and error, by casting {@spell identify}, or by spending an hour studying the skull circle. Study and {@spell identify} only reveal the property associated with the current state of the braziers, not all states at once. Lighting the braziers in some configurations triggers an effect automatically within moments, making overeager experimentation risky.": "点燃不同组合和排列的火盆会导致镶嵌的头骨产生不同的效果。这个图案可以作为一种有限的类型{@spell teleportation circle}，或者作为一个{@spell magic circle}。所有这些属性可以通过试错、施展{@spell identify}，或者花一个小时研究头骨圈来发现。研究和{@spell identify} 只揭示与当前火盆状态相关的属性，而不是一次性揭示所有状态。在某些配置下点燃火盆会立即触发效果，因此过于急切的实验可能会带来风险。",
	"Lighting one brazier causes the skull's eyes to glow dull green but has no other effect.": "点燃一个火盆会导致骷髅的眼睛发出暗绿色的微光，但没有其他效果。",
	"Lighting the two braziers at the bottom (west side) of the skull causes the eyes to glow bright green, and glowing green runes appear around the circle. Anyone with proficiency in {@skill Arcana} recognizes this as a {@spell teleportation circle}. It can be used normally as a teleport origin or destination by anyone who knows its arcane tag, as long as the braziers are lit. In addition, this circle is linked to a forgotten (by everyone except Imortra) {@spell teleportation circle} hidden in an overgrown tumble of boulders near the {@area temple to Yarila and Porevit|SC-E2|x} in the woods outside the town of Redtower. To teleport to that destination, a creature needs only to stand in the circle and think about that area, including the town of Redtower.": "点燃头骨底部（西侧）的两个火盆会使眼睛发出明亮的绿光，并在圆圈周围出现发光的绿色符文。任何具有{@skill Arcana}熟练度的人都会认出这是一个{@spell teleportation circle}。只要火盆被点燃，任何知道其奥术标记的人都可以正常使用它作为传送的起点或目的地。此外，这个圆圈与一个被遗忘的（除了伊莫特拉之外的所有人）{@spell teleportation circle}相连，它隐藏在红塔镇外的树林中一堆长满草的大石头中。要传送到那个目的地，生物只需站在圆圈里，想着那个区域，包括红塔镇。",
	"Lighting the two braziers at the top (east side) of the skull cause the eyes and teeth of the skull to glow deep, dark red, and glowing red runes appear around the circle.

It can be used normally as a teleport origin or destination by anyone who knows its arcane tag, as long as the braziers are lit. However, non-evil creatures who teleport to or from this circle take 27 ({@damage 6d8}) psychic damage and are {@condition frightened} upon arrival. A successful {@dc 18} Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and prevents the {@condition frightened} condition. A {@condition frightened} creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success. In addition, this circle is linked to a similar circle in a remote fold of the Shadow Realm. If characters choose to test their fate there, they find nothing but illusions, cruel fey, and perhaps a few other hapless mortals who were once as reckless as the characters are being.": "点燃位于头骨顶部（东侧）的两个火盆会使头骨的眼睛和牙齿发出深沉、暗红色的光芒，周围出现发光的红色符文。任何具备{@skill Arcana}熟练度的人都会认出这是一个{@spell teleportation circle}。与大多数传送阵不同，环绕这个传送阵的符文是用{@language Infernal}刻写的。只要火盆被点燃，任何知晓其奥术标记的人都可以正常使用它作为传送的起点或目的地。然而，传送到或从这个传送阵的非邪恶生物会受到27({@damage 6d8})点精神伤害，并在抵达时被{@condition frightened}。成功的{@dc 18}感知豁免会减半伤害并防止{@condition frightened}状态。{@condition frightened}生物在每个回合结束时重复进行豁免检定，成功则解除效果。此外，这个传送阵与暗影界中一个类似的传送阵相连。如果角色选择在那里测试命运，他们会发现除了幻象、残忍的精灵外，也许还有一些曾经像角色一样鲁莽的不幸凡人。",
	"Lighting two braziers at the northwest and southeast of the skull causes the eyes to glow violet and the ring to act as a {@spell magic circle} that contains fiends and elementals. If a gold coin or any other solid gold object is left inside the circle, a {@creature gilded devil|ToB} (Tome of Beasts) arrives within 5 minutes to claim it. This is Apnikeisim, who has \"advised\" Imortra in the past on the intricacies of devil conjuration. Although he can't leave the {@spell magic circle}, Apnikeisim is under no compulsion and he hasn't even been conjured; he merely responded to a call of his own free will. On seeing strangers' faces around the circle (and quite possibly Imortra's corpse lying nearby), Apnikeisim senses an opportunity. He wants more than anything to place the characters in his debt somehow, and the best way to do so is to provide them with information and a \"token of his debt.\" Apnikeisim can answer many questions about the Scarlet Citadel and {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, but he provides nothing of value without receiving something in return. He negotiates the highest price possible for everything. This can be actual treasure, but that's the least of Apnikeisim's interests. He'd much prefer an open-ended promise of a favor sometime in the future, or the promise of steadfastness (the character will fail a crucial saving throw against fright in the near future), generosity (the character receives no benefit from the next healing spell cast on them), or strength (the character's next three successful attacks cause minimum damage). After answering a few questions, Apnikeisim disappears, leaving behind a gold and topaz necklace worth 600 gp. As long as that necklace is with the characters, even if it's just stowed among their gear, Apnikeisim can scry on them and cause trouble for them in whatever minor ways you choose to plague the characters. Use the spell {@spell bestow curse} as a launch pad for ideas in this regard. Apnikeisim is free to dematerialize and return to wherever he came from whenever he wants. He does so if attacked— and he tries to become an even bigger thorn in the characters' sides in the future. No debt goes unpaid, and a debt of pain gains steep interest.": "点燃位于头骨西北和东南的两个火盆会使眼睛发出紫色光芒，戒指会作为一个{@spell magic circle}，其中封印着恶魔和元素生物。如果在圈内放置一枚金币或任何其他实心金制物品，{@creature gilded devil|ToB}(野兽之书)会在5分钟内出现来索取。这就是阿普尼凯西姆，他过去曾“建议”伊莫特拉有关恶魔召唤的复杂性。虽然他不能离开{@spell magic circle}，阿普尼凯西姆并没有被强制，他甚至没有被召唤；他只是出于自愿回应了一个呼唤。看到圈子周围的陌生人脸孔（很可能还有伊莫特拉的尸体躺在附近），阿普尼凯西姆察觉到了一个机会。他最想要的是让角色欠他人情，而最好的方式就是提供信息和“他的债务凭证”。阿普尼凯西姆可以回答关于血色城堡和{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}的许多问题，但他不会无偿提供任何有价值的信息。他会就每件事物谈判获取最高的价格。这可以是实际的财宝，但这对阿普尼凯西姆来说并不重要。他更希望得到一个未来某个时候的无限期承诺，或者坚定的承诺（角色将在不久的将来的关键豁免检定中失败），慷慨的承诺（角色不会从下一个对其施放的治疗法术中获益），或者力量的承诺（角色的下三次成功攻击造成最小伤害）。在回答了几个问题后，阿普尼凯西姆消失了，留下一条价值600金币的金黄水晶项链。只要这条项链与角色在一起，即使只是藏在他们的装备中，阿普尼凯西姆就可以窥视他们并以各种微小的方式给他们惹麻烦。在这方面，可以使用{@spell bestow curse}法术作为创意的起点。阿普尼凯西姆可以自由消失并随时返回他来自的地方。如果遭到攻击，他会这样做——并且他会试图在未来成为角色们更大的眼中钉。没有债务会不偿，而痛苦的债务会获得高额利息。",
	"Lighting two braziers at the northeast and southwest of the skull causes the eyes to glow orange. Within moments, the skull's glowing eyes and all other light sources in the chamber grow dim, then flash back to their normal level. After the flash, the circle is occupied by a {@creature dorreq|ToB} (Tome of Beasts), a nightmarish, octopus-like aberration, and the circle itself marks the boundary of a 15-foot {@spell globe of invulnerability}. The dorreq attacks immediately, gaining surprise. Furthermore, its tentacle attacks can originate from the creature itself or from any of the five tentacled faces around the room. A {@condition grappled} creature can be pulled through a tentacled face to inside the circle. The dorreq's Entanglement ability is in effect within 10 feet of the creature and within 10 feet of all five tentacled faces, which means it covers most of the chamber. The dorreq has no idea why it's suddenly here or who the characters are, and it has no interest in finding out. If it's still alive at the end of the fourth round of combat, it disappears as suddenly as it appeared, along with the {@spell globe of invulnerability}.": "在头骨的东北和西南各点燃两个火盆会使眼睛发出橙色的光芒。片刻之间，头骨的发光眼睛和室内所有其他光源变暗，然后闪回到正常亮度。闪光之后，圈内出现了一个{@creature dorreq|ToB}《野兽之书》中的恶梦般的章鱼状畸变生物，圈本身标志着一个15英尺{@spell globe of invulnerability}的边界。多瑞克立即发动攻击，获得先机。此外，它的触手攻击可以来自生物本身，也可以来自房间周围的五个有触手的面孔之一。一个{@condition grappled}生物可以被拉到圈内通过其中一个有触手的面孔。多瑞克的纠缠能力在生物周围10英尺范围内生效，也在五个有触手的面孔周围10英尺范围内生效，这意味着它覆盖了大部分房间。多瑞克不知道自己为什么突然出现在这里，也不知道人物是谁，也对了解没有兴趣。如果在第四回合结束时它仍然活着，它会像出现时一样突然消失，连同{@spell globe of invulnerability}一起。",

	"Lighting all four braziers causes the entire skull and circle to glow bright yellow. Black smoke pours upward from the skull to fill a 15-foot-diameter cylinder centered on the circle from floor to ceiling. The smoke swirls constantly and green lightning flashes through it. Inside the smoke is the extended consciousness of the {@creature voidling|ToB} from {@area Area 610|SC-610|x}. It casts {@spell fear} experimentally, makes a few tendril attacks (it too can attack through the tentacled faces), emits a Necrotic Burst, then disappears. Because this is only a projection of the {@creature voidling|ToB}, it recovers from any damage it takes at the end of each round. Even if it's killed here, it regenerates in {@area Area 610|SC-610|x} within 10 minutes.": "点亮所有四个火盆会导致整个头骨和圆圈发出明亮的黄光。黑烟从头骨中冒出，填满以圆圈为中心的直径15英尺的圆柱体，从地板到天花板。烟雾不断旋转，绿色闪电在其中闪烁。在烟雾中是来自{@area Area 610|SC-610|x}的{@creature voidling|ToB}的扩展意识。它进行{@spell fear}实验，发动几次触手攻击（它也可以通过触手面进行攻击），释放一次死灵爆发，然后消失。因为这只是{@creature voidling|ToB}的一个投影，它会在每个回合结束时恢复任何受到的伤害。即使它在这里被杀死，它也会在{@area Area 610|SC-610|x}内的10分钟内再生。",

If you judge the circumstances to be right for an ironically dramatic turn, either of these creatures could grapple Imortra and carry her away with them, screaming, when they disappear from the chamber.": "如果角色们发现自己在这里与伊莫特拉（Imortra）战斗，她会召唤{@creature dorreq|ToB}或{@creature voidling|ToB}中的一个，取决于她点燃火盆的时间。这两者实际上都不是她的盟友，但她知道如何保持距离。如果你认为情况适合戏剧性转折，这两种生物中的任何一种都可以抓住伊莫特拉并在消失时带走她，尖叫着离开房间。",

Imortra used the imp in some of her experiments. {@creature Natisti|KPSC} begs them piteously to set it free, or at least kill it, so it can return to the Nine Hells. It has nothing to offer in exchange except for its knowledge about the hidden compartment beneath Imortra's bed, which it has seen her use. It honestly doesn't know about the glyphs, since Imortra doesn't set them off.": "笼子看起来是空的，但实际上不是。里面有一个名叫{@creature Natisti|KPSC}的小恶魔，在听到角色们靠近时变成了{@condition invisible}。拥有{@spell true seeing}的角色仍然可以看到这个小恶魔。这个小恶魔无法改变形态；笼子里的某些东西阻止了它。伊莫特拉在一些实验中使用了这个小恶魔。{@creature Natisti|KPSC}恳求他们可怜地释放它，或者至少杀死它，这样它就可以回到九层地狱。它没有什么可以交换的，除了关于伊莫特拉床下隐藏隔间的知识，它曾看到她使用过。它并不知道有关符文的事情，因为伊莫特拉没有触发它们。",

Finally, its course coincides with several ley lines for part of its length. What effect this overlap has and how it impacts the physical and shadow aspects of the river is not well understood. That mystery is precisely what drew so many entities to this neighborhood and why {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} is studying the river now.": "黑河是一个谜。首先，但也是最不为人知的，它是一条真实的、流动的地下河流，尽管它的路径从未被绘制出来。矛盾的是，由于未知原因，它的流向有时会倒转。它也是一个影子河：是交错在中加德和精灵明亮之地之间的影子境域中的水道版本。最后，它的路径在一部分长度上与几条地脉相重合。这种重叠会产生什么影响，以及它如何影响河流的物理和影子方面，目前尚不清楚。正是这种神秘吸引了这么多实体来到这个地区，也是为什么{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}现在正在研究这条河。",
	"In addition to these mysteries, the dwarves who built much of the citadel brought with them from Melana the faith of Charun {@creature the Boatman|KPSC}. The Black River flowing beneath the citadel was a metaphor for Charun's sacred black river of tears, which was said to connect the mortal world to Yggdrasil, and Midgard to the many realms of the outer planes. Charun's influence is strong on the river, raising the possibility the actual Black River and the symbolic black river of tears might have more in common than a coincidence of name.": "除了这些谜团之外，建造大部分城堡的矮人们还从梅拉纳(Melana)带来了卡鲁恩(Charun)的信仰{@creature the Boatman|KPSC}。城堡下流淌的黑河是卡鲁恩神圣黑泪之河的隐喻，据说它连接着凡间与世界树(Yggdrasil)、米德加德(Midgard)与外域诸多位面。卡鲁恩对这条河的影响很大，这引发了一个可能性，即实际的黑河和象征性的黑泪之河可能不仅仅是名字的巧合。",
	"Whether or not the dwarves realized it, the Black River flowing under the citadel is more than a metaphor. Cultists of Charun make pilgrimages along shadow rivers. It was one such pilgrimage that brought the shadow elf wizard Quendreth the Wise and a company of pilgrims to this spot. Quendreth recognized the geomantic power of the site and built a temple here. The mystic convergence of shadow road and ley lines infused the temple with arcane power, and the temple fed that power back into shadow road and ley line.": "无论矮人是否意识到，流过城堡下方的黑河不仅仅是一个隐喻。查伦教徒沿着暗影河朝圣。正是一次这样的朝圣带来了暗影精灵巫师智者昆德雷斯和一队朝圣者来到这个地方。昆德雷斯意识到了这个地点的地理能量，并在这里建造了一座神庙。暗影之路和地脉的神秘交汇使神庙充满了奥术力量，而神庙则将这股力量反馈到暗影之路和地脉中。",
	"Charun's cult has many dark aspects but it's not inherently evil. Its preoccupation with death doesn't involve spreading death, or promoting death as a goal, or death as an expression of chaos. Rather, it recognizes that all mortal beings eventually die and it heralds Charun's role as the soul's guide into the afterlife. Still, any \"cult of death\" attracts unsavory followers who, if they gain influence, turn it toward ever more evil beliefs and pursuits. This is what happened to the temple of Charun beneath the citadel.": "Charun（卡鲁恩）的教派有许多黑暗面，但并非本质上邪恶。它对死亡的关注并不涉及传播死亡，或将死亡视为目标，或将死亡视为混沌的表达。相反，它承认所有凡人最终会死去，并宣扬Charun作为灵魂引领者进入来世的角色。然而，任何\"死亡教派\"都会吸引不良追随者，如果他们获得影响力，就会将其转向更邪恶的信仰和追求。这就是发生在城堡下的Charun神庙的情况。",
	"One leader in particular, {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}, turned increasingly toward evil rites and, even worse, toward Vardesain instead of Charun. Before long, members of the cult became more enthralled with undeath than with life. Eventually {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} pursued rituals that, with Vardesain's help (in the form of the horrific chained thing), transformed her into a {@creature hierophant lich|CCodex} and her most faithful followers into phantom wights.": "有一位领袖，特别是{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}，逐渐转向邪恶仪式，更糟糕的是，转向了瓦德赛因(Vardesain)而不是查伦(Charun)。不久之后，邪教成员对不死之物的迷恋超过了对生命的追求。最终{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}进行了仪式，借助瓦德赛因的帮助（以可怕的锁链生物的形式），将她转变成{@creature hierophant lich|CCodex}，将她最忠实的追随者变成了幽灵厉鬼。",
	"At that point, the only creature along the Black River with the power to challenge {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} was a shadow river lord with whom the Charun cultists had maintained a nervous truce. {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} arranged an ambush, and the shadow river lord was captured and imprisoned in a specially built and sealed sarcophagus ({@area Area 511|SC-511|x}). {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} converted the main temple of Charun to worship of Vardesain and into a crypt for herself and her faithful myrmidons ({@area Area 509|SC-509|x}).": "在那时，唯一有能力挑战{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}的生物是黑河上的一位影子河领主，与其保持着紧张的停战的Charun教徒。{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}安排了一个伏击，影子河领主被捕并关押在一个专门建造和密封的石棺中({@area Area 511|SC-511|x})。{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}将Charun的主要神殿改为崇拜Vardesain的场所，并成为她和她忠实的侍从的墓穴({@area Area 509|SC-509|x})。",
	"Such is the state of the Black River now. It is the remnant of a once-important site, perverted to evil purposes and occupied by undead creatures and horrid aberrations that no longer remember why they're here. But the shadow river lord is only entombed, not destroyed. If it were released, it would eagerly pursue revenge over {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}. Since characters probably can't defeat the lich without the river lord's help, they need to find a way to release it. Complicating this is the fact that {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} holds the key to the river lord's sarcophagus, so characters must face the lich at least once on their own before they can set the wheels of ancient vengeance into motion.": "如今黑河的状况就是这样。它是曾经一个重要场所的残余，被扭曲为邪恶之地，被不死生物和可怕的畸变生物占据，它们已经不记得自己为何在这里。但暗影河之主只是被封印，而非被摧毁。如果它被释放，它将急切地寻求对{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}的复仇。由于角色们可能无法在没有河之主帮助的情况下击败巫妖，他们需要找到一种释放它的方法。使情况复杂化的是{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}掌握着河之主石棺的钥匙，因此角色们必须至少独自面对巫妖一次，然后才能启动古老复仇的进程。",
	"Tucked away in a hidden sanctum is {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, plying his research with little regard for the evil around him as long as it leaves him alone. Gellert has his own designs on the characters; he needs them to destroy an enemy on Level 6.": "藏在一个隐秘圣所里的{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}，专心进行研究，只要邪恶不打扰他，他就毫不在意周围的邪恶。Gellert对这些角色有自己的打算；他需要他们去摧毁第6层的一个敌人。",
	"The only other humanoid presence on this level is a small cadre of deep one-human hybrids that come occasionally to worship at some of the ancient temples to evil entities and to stash some of the golden tribute they collect from fishermen. These deep one hybrids are far from their usual territory along the coast and in the deep ocean. The Black River is much like the lightless abysses where the deep ones spawn, and they've learned that it gives them quick access to inland areas that would otherwise be beyond their reach.": "在这一层唯一的其他人类存在是一小群深渊人-人类混血，他们偶尔会来到一些古老邪恶实体的庙宇中膜拜，并把从渔民那里收集的黄金贡品藏起来。这些深渊人混血远离他们通常沿海和深海的领地。黑河很像深渊深处深渊人产卵的无光深渊，他们发现这让他们迅速进入本来超出他们触及范围的内陆地区。",
	"Most areas of this level function in isolation. A battle isn't likely to draw any reaction from neighbors unless an area description states otherwise. One resident in particular, however—{@creature Brutwer|KPSC} the blood hag ({@area Areas 513|SC-513|x} and {@area 514|SC-514|x})—does all she can from the safety of the darkness and the river bottom to bedevil the characters' attempts at exploration.": "这个层次的大部分区域都是独立运作的。除非区域描述另有说明，否则战斗不太可能引起邻居的任何反应。然而，有一个居民特别引人注目—{@creature Brutwer|KPSC} 血巫婆 ({@area Areas 513|SC-513|x} 和 {@area 514|SC-514|x})—她尽一切努力，从黑暗和河底的安全中来阻挠角色们的探索尝试。",
	"A wind blows through portions of this level. This is caused by the {@item sphere of annihilation} on Level 6 drawing air into itself. The wind should be something of a mystery to characters since it seems to blow in conflicting directions, until they figure out that it's all blowing down to a lower level.": "一股风吹过这个层级的部分区域。这是由于6层的{@item sphere of annihilation}吸引空气进入其中所致。对角色来说，这股风应该是个谜，因为它似乎朝着不同的方向吹，直到他们发现它实际上是朝着更低的层级吹去。",
	"A boat is tied up at the frog shrine ({@area Area 512|SC-512|x}). Imortra sometimes uses it to get from the shrine to Gellert's Landing ({@area Area 501|SC-501|x}). When she uses the boat, she's always accompanied by devils as bodyguards. The creatures in the Black River know from experience to leave her alone. They don't know that about the characters, so the river isn't safe for them.": "一艘船停泊在青蛙神龛({@area Area 512|SC-512|x})处。Imortra有时会使用它从神龛到盖勒特码头({@area Area 501|SC-501|x})。当她使用这艘船时，她总是有恶魔作为保镖陪同。黑河里的生物根据经验知道要远离她。它们并不了解角色们，所以对他们来说这条河并不安全。",
	"The boat is represented on an {@area overlay|SC-512-MO|x}. You should cut out the boat so it can move independently on the map of the river. The boat is two spaces wide and six spaces long. In use with miniatures or tokens, one creature can occupy the bow (where the coiled rope is), one creature can occupy the stern, and up to eight creatures can occupy the midsection side by side. The stern is the position for the rower—typically the river lord.": "这艘船在一个{@area overlay|SC-512-MO|x}上被代表。你应该剪下船，这样它可以在河流地图上独立移动。这艘船有两个空间宽，六个空间长。在使用微型模型或代币时，一个生物可以占据船头（卷绳的地方），一个生物可以占据船尾，最多八个生物可以并排占据中部。船尾是划船者的位置——通常是河流领主。",
	"{@creature The boatman|KPSC} is a {@creature flesh golem|MM} created by the cultists for this specific purpose. Its appearance matches Charun's: a black robe with a deep hood that hides all but its corpselike hands from view. It uses a long oar to propel the boat. There are no visible cues that under its voluminous cloak, {@creature the boatman|KPSC} is a golem; characters won't know what it is unless they pull back its hood or peek under its robes, which is not advised.": "{@creature The boatman|KPSC} 是一种由异教徒为特定目的而创造的 {@creature flesh golem|MM}。它的外观与查伦(Charun)的相似：一件黑色长袍，深深的兜帽遮住了除了尸体般的手之外的所有部分。它使用一根长桨来推动船只。在它蓬松的斗篷下没有任何可见的线索表明 {@creature the boatman|KPSC} 是一个魔像；角色们不会知道它是什么，除非他们拉开它的兜帽或窥视它的长袍下面，这是不被建议的。",
	"As characters step onto the boat, {@creature the boatman|KPSC} extends its right hand, palm up. To use the boat safely, each character who gets on must pay {@creature the boatman|KPSC} 1 gold piece; not 10 silver pieces or 100 copper pieces or a cheap azurite ring, but 1 gold piece each. If given a gold piece, the golem drops the coin into a pouch at its waist and extends its hand to the next passenger. If given something else of any value, it drops the offering into the river and re-extends its hand.": "当角色踏上船只时，{@creature the boatman|KPSC} 伸出右手，手掌朝上。为了安全地使用这艘船，每位上船的角色必须支付{@creature the boatman|KPSC} 1金币；不是10银币或100铜币，也不是一枚廉价的蓝宝石戒指，而是每人1金币。如果给了一枚金币，魔像会把硬币放入腰间的袋子里，然后伸出手给下一个乘客。如果给了其他任何有价值的东西，魔像会把礼物扔进河里，然后重新伸出手。",
	"Assuming everyone pays their fare, someone must state where along the Black River they want to go. {@creature The boatman|KPSC} doesn't try to twist their words against them; it takes them to any nearby point that's expressed with even minimal clarity. If passengers ask to be taken to Gellert, for example, the river lord takes them to Gellert's Landing ({@area Area 501|SC-501|x}). If they ask for \"the pyramid\" or even \"the gold,\" it takes them to {@area Area 505|SC-505|x}. As long as they've paid, it takes them to the location closest to what they ask for and they aren't attacked by river creatures.": "假设每个人都支付了车费，那么必须有人声明他们想去黑河沿线的哪个地方。{@creature The boatman|KPSC} 不会曲解他们的话；它会把他们带到任何附近的地点，只要表达得足够清晰。例如，如果乘客要求去盖勒特，河之领主会把他们带到盖勒特的码头 ((盖勒特着陆点 {@area Area 501|SC-501|x}))。如果他们要求去“金字塔”甚至是“黄金”，它会把他们带到 {@area Area 505|SC-505|x}。只要他们已经支付了，它会把他们带到离他们要求最接近的地点，并且不会受到河流生物的攻击。",
	"Each passenger must pay his or her own fare. It doesn't matter where the gold coin came from but it must be placed in {@creature the boatman|KPSC}'s hand by the passenger. If, for example, one character places four gold coins in the outstretched hand to pay for herself and three others, three coins get dropped into the river and only one goes into {@creature the boatman|KPSC}'s pouch.": "每位乘客必须支付自己的车费。金币的来源并不重要，但必须由乘客放入{@creature the boatman|KPSC}的手中。例如，如果一个角色把四枚金币放在伸出的手中为自己和其他三人支付，那么三枚金币会掉进河里，只有一枚进入{@creature the boatman|KPSC}的袋子里。",

	"{@creature The boatman|KPSC} understands {@language Common} but it never speaks. If someone stands at the edge of the Black River and says aloud, \"Charun, I request your favor,\" or similar words to call {@creature the boatman|KPSC}, the golem poles the boat to the character's location. It doesn't respond to insults or informal calls. It is freed of all obligation to serve the characters if it's attacked or even insulted too often, if someone picks its pocket, if someone damages the boat, if someone tries to throw back its hood or see beneath its robe, or if someone tries to snatch its oar. It may be only a golem, but the cultists of Charun set up their boatman as a religious symbol, not as something to be treated like a punching bag or a clown. Doing so frees it to do as it pleases, and on the Black River, it can put unwanted passengers into serious peril.": "{@creature The boatman|KPSC}明白{@language Common}，但从不开口。如果有人站在黑河的边缘大声说：“Charun，我请求你的恩惠”，或类似的话来召唤{@creature the boatman|KPSC}，这个魔像就会划船将角色送到指定地点。它不会对侮辱或非正式的召唤作出回应。如果它被攻击或被侮辱太多次，如果有人掏它口袋，如果有人损坏了船只，如果有人试图掀开它的兜帽或看穿它的长袍下面，或者有人试图抢夺它的桨，那么它就会被解除为角色服务的义务。尽管它只是一个魔像，但Charun的教徒们将他们的船夫视为宗教象征，而不是可以随意对待的沙袋或小丑。这样做会使它得以自由行事，在黑河上，它可以让不受欢迎的乘客陷入严重危险之中。",
	"The boat is not a stable fighting platform. Characters on the boat attack as usual, but their AC is reduced by 2 to reflect the unsteady footing.

	"If characters aren't experiencing augmented reality, they see only more of the simple stone landing with a poorly maintained fishing net hanging on a drying rack and a few other fishing tools.

Ask for {@dc 6} Strength ({@skill Athletics}) checks from characters who attempt the swim. A successful check gets the character through the passage in 10 or 20 seconds without incident. An unsuccessful check causes the character to get turned around in the steep passage until it runs out of breath and begins suffocating. The character has a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) to get out of the tunnel before their hit points drop to 0 from suffocation. The character repeats the Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check once per round, and they get out of the passage on a success. If the modified result of the check is even, they reach the cursed cave; if the result is odd, they find their way back to Gellert's living room. Characters can aid each other on these checks. If the group thinks to string a rope through the passage, then weaker swimmers can pull themselves along it and their Strength checks succeed automatically.": "进入这个房间的通道完全被水淹没。事实上，它下沉了10英尺，然后再爬到与{@area Area 503|SC-503|x}相同的水平。角色必须屏住呼吸并游泳才能到达这里。通道足够短，几乎没有危险。要求尝试游泳的角色进行{@dc 6}力量({@skill Athletics})检定。成功的检定使角色在10或20秒内顺利通过通道。失败的检定会导致角色在陡峭的通道中迷失方向，直到呼吸耗尽并开始窒息。角色有与其体质调整值相等的回合数（最少1个回合）来走出隧道，否则生命值会因窒息而降至0。角色每回合重复进行力量({@skill Athletics})检定，成功则走出通道。如果检定的修改结果为偶数，他们到达了被诅咒的洞穴；如果结果为奇数，他们会回到格勒特的客厅。角色可以在这些检定上互相帮助。如果小组想到在通道中穿过绳子，那么较弱的游泳者可以沿着绳子拉动自己，他们的力量检定会自动成功。",

A possessed character, on the other hand, with its full range of class abilities and spells at the disposal of {@creature the ghostly foe|KPSC}, is potentially very dangerous. Be sure possessed characters understand that while they have no control over their actions, they always have the option to fail the saving throw at the end of {@creature the ghostly foe|KPSC}'s turn and become {@condition petrified}. It's not a great solution, but it can prevent a total wipeout of the party and let someone get away to bring aid. {@condition Petrified} characters can survive several days in that state before {@creature the ghostly foe|KPSC} consumes their psyche and slays them.": "单单这些表现对于8级角色来说并不特别危险。另一方面，一个被附身的角色，拥有{@creature the ghostly foe|KPSC}的所有职业能力和法术，潜在地非常危险。确保被附身的角色明白，虽然他们无法控制自己的行动，但他们始终有选择在{@creature the ghostly foe|KPSC}的回合结束时放弃豁免检定并变成{@condition petrified}的选项。这并不是一个完美的解决方案，但可以防止全灭队伍，让某人逃脱并寻求援助。{@condition Petrified}角色在那种状态下可以存活数天，直到{@creature the ghostly foe|KPSC}消耗他们的心灵并杀死他们。",

The falling water is like fine rain rather than a thin waterfall by the time it reaches the river. It's impossible to enter {@area Area 505|SC-505|x} or get past this stretch of river without getting wet. The rain itself doesn't hurt anything, but adventurers tend to be wary of everything unusual. Because the bats and the derro sometimes drop scraps, bones, and body parts through the hole, river creatures congregate here. If characters are swimming or are using the boat without {@creature the boatman|KPSC}, an encounter with {@creature lesser scrag|CCodex|scrags}, {@creature cipactli|CCodex}, {@creature Gargoctopus|CCodex|gargoctopi}, and/or {@creature water leaper|ToB|water leapers} is guaranteed.": "湖蓝色溪流的水从上方中央蝙蝠洞穴的地板上的洞中流出，然后倾泻到黑河之上的水域，这个水域正好位于这个洞穴入口外。当水流到达河流时，已经变成了细雨，而不是细小的瀑布。没有办法进入{@area Area 403|SC-403|x}或者越过这段河流而不湿身。雨水本身并不会造成伤害，但冒险者们往往对一切异常事物保持警惕。由于蝙蝠和德罗有时会通过这个洞投下残渣、骨头和身体部分，河流生物会在这里聚集。如果角色在游泳或者在没有{@creature the boatman|KPSC}的情况下使用船只，那么就会遇到{@creature lesser scrag|CCodex|scrags}、{@creature cipactli|CCodex}、{@creature Gargoctopus|CCodex|gargoctopi}和/或{@creature water leaper|ToB|water leapers}。",

The portal becomes active when the peaks of the five pyramids at either location are draped in a single spider web. This construct was built by the spiders of Leng ages ago for reasons no one remembers or cares about. It was rediscovered within recent decades by the Leng spider {@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}, who recognized this as an ideal place to store some of its treasure.": "五座金字塔是通往冷高原上一组相同金字塔的传送门。当两地任一位置的五座金字塔的尖顶被一张蜘蛛网覆盖时，传送门就会激活。这个构造物是冷高原的蜘蛛{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}在很久以前建造的，但没有人记得或在意建造的原因。最近几十年内，这个传送门被冷高原的蜘蛛{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}重新发现，它意识到这是一个理想的地方来存放一些宝藏。",
	"Once the portal is opened, it stays open for as long as the webs remain. {@spell Web} is a {@status concentration} spell, so a character who casts it can end the spell at any time. Even ending the spell within a round or two won't put off {@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}; the avaricious spider comes to check on its stash regardless by reopening the portal from its own side.": "一旦传送门打开，只要蜘蛛网还在，它就会保持打开状态。{@spell Web}是一个{@status concentration}法术，因此施法者可以随时结束法术。即使在一两个回合内结束法术也不会阻止{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC};贪婪的蜘蛛会重新打开传送门，从自己的一侧检查它的贮藏物。",
	"In that case, characters might notice webs spinning across the pyramids seemingly of their own accord moments before the portal reopens and {@creature Xymargshra|KPSC} emerges.": "在这种情况下，角色们可能会注意到在金字塔上方似乎自发地结出蜘蛛网，就在传送门重新打开并出现{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}之前。",
	"Characters may be tempted to use the portal and see where it goes. The portal itself is an opaque disk of swirling black and purple like an immense, swollen bruise. It's created with Void magic as a security measure against incursions from Midgard ({@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}'s paranoia cannot be overstated). A creature not of Leng who touches the portal in any way takes 28 ({@damage 8d6}) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw. A creature who steps through bodily or pokes its head through to have a look around immediately drops to 0 hit points and begins dying. If a character goes through without taking the precaution of tying a rope around their waist, and you're feeling generous, you can allow their body to fall with one foot still sticking through the portal on the Midgard side.": "角色可能会被诱惑使用传送门，看看它通往何方。传送门本身是一个不透明的盘状物，黑紫色交织，如同一个巨大的、肿胀的淤青。它是用虚空魔法制造的，作为对来自米德加德的入侵的安全措施（{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}的偏执狂无法言喻）。任何不属于莱恩的生物只要触碰传送门，就会受到28点({@damage 8d6})死灵伤害，或者在成功的{@dc 15}敏捷豁免才能减半。任何身体穿过或者探头探脑地看一眼的生物，立刻掉到0点生命值并开始垂死。如果一个角色没有采取绑绳子在腰间的预防措施就穿过了传送门，如果你心情好，你可以让他们的身体在米德加德的那一边，还有一只脚伸出传送门。",
	"Before coming through the portal, {@creature Xymargshra|KPSC} may send an {@spell arcane eye} to inspect the situation. When it sees it's up against seasoned adventurers, it has the option of first using a spell scroll of {@spell invisibility} or even {@spell greater invisibility} from its library, depending on how challenging you want this battle to be. When it arrives, it immediately spider-climbs up to the ceiling and fights with spells as much as possible. Because the golden door is open whenever the portal is open, the {@creature ghostwalk spider|ToB} (Tome of Beasts) from {@area Area 506|SC-506|x} also joins in this battle.": "穿过传送门之前，{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC} 可以派遣一个{@spell arcane eye}去检查情况。当它发现自己要面对经验丰富的冒险者时，它可以选择首先使用一张{@spell invisibility}的法术卷轴，甚至是从它的图书馆中使用{@spell greater invisibility}，这取决于你想要这场战斗有多具挑战性。当它到达时，它立即蜘蛛爬行到天花板上，并尽可能多地使用法术进行战斗。因为金色大门只要传送门开着就会打开，来自{@area Area 506|SC-506|x}的{@creature ghostwalk spider|ToB}（野兽之书）也会加入这场战斗。",
	"{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC} isn't interested in negotiating with the characters, but it will of course deliver a monologue during battle (in its harsh voice sprinkled with the impossible vowels and consonants of Void Speech) describing its utter disdain for lesser life forms and the certainty of its victory. In its multiple eyes, the characters are thieves deserving only death.": "{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC} 不感兴趣与角色们谈判，但在战斗中它当然会发表独白（用虚空语言中不可能的元音和辅音的刺耳声音），描述它对较低生命形式的蔑视以及对胜利的确定性。在它的多只眼睛中，角色们只是应该死的小偷。",
	"The treasure here is as much a curse as a reward.": "这里的宝藏与其说是奖励，不如说是诅咒。",
	"The ceiling here is 15 feet high, so creatures clinging to the ceiling can reach targets standing on the floor with most melee attacks.": "这里的天花板有15英尺高，所以紧贴天花板的生物可以用大多数近战攻击击中站在地板上的目标。",
	"The central portion of this chamber is a pit or depression in the floor, which is filled with a heaping mound of golden and silver treasure. After the initial dazzlement, you realize the coins, jewelry, and artistic objects are all in unfamiliar, strange patterns. They have an air of unreality about them, almost as if they don't belong in this world.": "这个房间的中央部分是一个坑或地面上的凹陷处，里面堆满了一大堆金银财宝。在最初的眩目之后，你意识到这些硬币、珠宝和艺术品都呈现出陌生而奇怪的图案。它们散发着一种不真实的气息，几乎好像不属于这个世界。",
	"A golden door stands in the east wall of the chamber, very similar in design to the door you came through.": "在房间的东墙上立着一扇金色的门，设计非常类似于你进来时经过的那扇门。",
	"Stretched across the top of the treasure-filled pit is a web of nearly {@condition invisible} strands of spider silk spun by {@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}. A character who examines the pit closely before reaching for something spots the webbing with a successful {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. The webbing behaves exactly like a {@spell web} spell, but it's also coated with {@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}'s venom. A creature who touches it must make a successful {@dc 14} Dexterity saving throw or become {@condition restrained} by the webs until they break free with a successful {@dc 14} Strength check. It's reasonable to assume that unless a player states otherwise, their character reaches into the pit with their dominant hand. Since that's the hand they typically use for wielding a weapon, until they get free they can only use one-handed weapons, they make melee attacks with disadvantage, and they can't cast spells that have somatic components.": "横跨宝藏填满的坑顶部的是一张由{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}织成的近{@condition invisible}根蜘蛛丝网。在伸手拿取东西之前仔细检查坑的角色通过成功的{@dc 15}感知({@skill Perception})检定就能发现这些网。这些网的行为与{@spell web}法术完全相同，但也涂有{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}的毒液。触碰它的生物必须进行成功的{@dc 14}敏捷豁免检定，否则将被网困住，直到通过成功的{@dc 14}力量检定挣脱。可以合理地假设，除非玩家另有说明，他们的角色会用主要手伸入坑中。由于这是他们通常用于持武器的手，直到脱困前他们只能使用单手武器，使用近战攻击时有劣势，并且无法施放需要手势成分的法术。",
	"Lurking beneath the treasure is a {@creature ghostwalk spider|ToB} (Tome of Beasts) that serves {@creature Xymargshra|KPSC} as a guardian. While it's still hidden (before characters see it or have a chance to identify it), it uses a bonus action to Ghostwalk. The spider can then jump up through the treasure and the webs incorporeally, use Spider Climb to cling to the ceiling, and attack. Its attacks don't make it visible, so characters should have no idea what they're up against unless they use some means to make the spider visible, such as {@spell faerie fire}. It's incorporeal, so tricks like dousing it with flour don't help.": "在宝藏下面潜伏着一本{@creature ghostwalk spider|ToB}《野兽之书》(Tome of Beasts)，作为守护者的是{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}。当它还隐藏着（在角色看到它或有机会识别它之前），它会使用一个奖励动作进行幽灵行走。这只蜘蛛然后可以穿过宝藏和蜘蛛网，利用蜘蛛攀爬粘在天花板上，并进行攻击。它的攻击不会让它变得可见，所以角色除非使用某种方法让蜘蛛可见，如{@spell faerie fire}，否则不会知道他们面对的是什么。它是非实体的，所以像泼洒面粉之类的把戏是无济于事的。",
	"Characters who find themselves fighting both {@creature Xymargshra|KPSC} and the {@creature ghostwalk spider|ToB} here are in for a rough time. If they flee back to the Black River, {@creature Xymargshra|KPSC} launches a few more venom attacks at them provided it can do so in relative safety with half cover from the elevated doorway. It doesn't risk getting killed just to hurry the characters' retreat. Neither {@creature Xymargshra|KPSC} nor the {@creature ghostwalk spider|ToB} pursue anyone onto the Black River.": "在这里，那些发现自己与{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}和{@creature ghostwalk spider|ToB}交战的角色会度过艰难时光。如果他们逃回黑河，{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}会在相对安全的情况下从高高的门口处发动几次毒液攻击，只要它能够做到这一点。它不会冒着被杀的风险来加速角色的撤退。{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC}和{@creature ghostwalk spider|ToB}都不会追击任何人进入黑河。",
	"If characters return after even a short rest, they find both spiders back at full health. They'll need a better plan, not just brute force, to overcome this chamber.": "如果角色们在短暂休息后回来，他们会发现两只蜘蛛的生命值已经完全恢复。他们需要一个更好的计划，不仅仅是蛮力，才能克服这个房间。",
	"The pit is only 1 foot deep. Even without the {@creature ghostwalk spider|ToB} in it, it's full, containing 12 cubic feet of treasure.": "这个坑只有1英尺深。即使没有里面的{@creature ghostwalk spider|ToB}，它也是满的，包含12立方英尺的宝藏。",
	"Everything here is from either the Plateau of Leng or from the Void. The coins are made from unfamiliar alloys and are stamped with {@language Void Speech|ToB} script. Much of the jewelry is too large or too small for a human, or simply isn't fitted to humanoid anatomy. The art objects are even worse—the abstract art is unsettling to look at, and \"realistic\" statues and portraits are downright horrifying. Even items that could only be decanters, goblets, or eating utensils imply an inhuman physiology and diet that hardly bear thinking about.": "这里的一切都来自于冷高原或虚空。硬币是由陌生的合金制成，并印有{@language Void Speech|ToB}文字。许多珠宝对人类来说要么太大要么太小，或者根本不适合人类的解剖结构。艺术品更糟糕——抽象艺术令人不安，而“写实”雕塑和肖像简直令人恐惧。甚至那些只能是瓶子、高脚杯或餐具的物品也暗示了一种非人类的生理结构和饮食习惯，几乎让人不敢想象。",
	"To determine specifically what's here, treat the hoard as two challenge 5–10 treasures. When characters try to sell any of it, however, they find its value is only half of what they expect because all buyers are so disturbed by the nature of the material. Art objects in this collection also tend to be large and bulky. Half of all magic items recovered here are cursed. Roll {@dice 1d6} and consult the {@table Item Curses|KPSC} table to determine a curse that can be applied to a normal magic item.": "为了具体确定这里有什么，将这个藏宝当作两个5-10级挑战的宝藏。然而，当角色们尝试出售其中的任何物品时，他们会发现其价值只有他们期望的一半，因为所有的买家都对这些物品的性质感到不安。这个收藏中的艺术品也往往又大又笨重。在这里找到的所有魔法物品中有一半是被诅咒的。掷骰{@dice 1d6}并查阅{@table Item Curses|KPSC}表格，确定可以应用于普通魔法物品的诅咒。",

	"If a character studies the markings on the door and makes their Wisdom saving throw successfully (or the character can read Void Speech, regardless of the saving throw's success or failure), they receive a clue as to how the door can be opened. They see a fleeting image of {@creature Xymargshra|KPSC} spitting venom onto the door. For the characters to open it, they must slice open the Leng spider's venom sacks and extract a few ounces of the thick liquid. This is a tricky operation. The character doing the extraction must make a successful {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check or they get enough venom on themselves to cause 12 ({@damage 2d8 + 3}) poison damage and {@condition blinded|PHB|blindness}. Their sight returns after a few seconds. If the {@skill Medicine} check fails by 5 or more, they lose all the venom along with their chance to open this door. As long as the result of the check is 10 or more, they extract enough venom to open the door four times (assuming they have a suitable container to store it in, such as an empty potion bottle).": "如果一个角色研究门上的标记并成功通过他们的感知豁免检定（或者角色可以阅读虚空语，无论豁免检定成功与否），他们会得到一个线索，告诉他们如何打开这扇门。他们会看到一个瞬间的画面，{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC} 向门上吐毒液。为了打开这扇门，角色必须切开冷螈蜘蛛的毒囊并提取几盎司浓稠液体。这是一个棘手的操作。进行提取的角色必须成功进行一个{@dc 15}感知({@skill Medicine})检定，否则他们会被毒液溅到，造成12({@damage 2d8 + 3})毒性伤害和{@condition blinded|PHB|blindness}。几秒后他们的视力会恢复。如果{@skill Medicine}检定失败了5点或更多，他们会失去所有的毒液，也失去打开这扇门的机会。只要检定的结果达到10或更高，他们就能提取到足够的毒液来打开这扇门四次（假设他们有适当的容器来存放，比如一个空的药水瓶）。",
	"This door opens like the other one, by dissolving into thin air. It remains open for 10 minutes, then reappears and reseals the aperture.": "这扇门像另一扇门一样打开，消失在空气中。它会保持打开状态10分钟，然后重新出现并重新封闭门口。",

	"The crystals lining the walls, ceiling, and floor amplify the glittering light from the worm in dazzling displays. Occasionally they emit a dim, purple glow of their own that wells up inside them and cascades across the room before rapidly fading away. This irregular, pulsing light creates an impression of the room's illumination filtering through water.": "墙壁、天花板和地板上的水晶放大了虫子发出的闪闪发光的光线，形成令人眼花缭乱的景象。偶尔它们会发出自己微弱的紫色光芒，从内部涌出，然后迅速消失在房间里。这种不规则的、脉动的光线给人一种透过水过滤的房间照明的印象。",

	"Unfortunately, the crystals of this chamber interact with the ley-line energy coursing along the Black River in a unique way; area-of-effect evocation spells cast in this chamber (by a caster occupying any of the purple-hued spaces) can't be sculpted around creatures, and their areas fill the entire chamber even if the spell is normally a cone, a line, or some other shape. For example, a {@spell lightning bolt} strikes every creature in the chamber, including the caster, regardless of where it was aimed or how it was sculpted.": "不幸的是，这个房间的水晶与沿着黑河流动的地脉能量以一种独特的方式相互作用；在这个房间里施放范围效果召唤法术的施法者（占据任何紫色空间的施法者）无法围绕生物进行雕塑，它们的范围会填满整个房间，即使法术通常是一个锥形、一条线或其他形状。例如，一个{@spell lightning bolt}会击中房间内的每个生物，包括施法者，无论它瞄准的是哪里或者如何被雕塑。",
	"Initially, the {@creature fate eater|ToB|fate eaters} coiled around the golem are merely curious about the characters. They communicate via telepathy, and they frequently \"speak\" in harmonic unison or complete each other's sentences. Their telepathic communication makes it impossible for characters to determine which one is \"speaking.\" If characters ask the worms to name themselves or identify which is communicating, they don't understand the question.

If some of this crystal in powdered form is added to the normal material components of an evocation spell, the spell's area of effect can be changed to another shape with the same volume.

With this powdered crystal, lightning bolt could be cast as a sphere with a 10-foot radius, a 15-foot cone (noting that a cone is three-dimensional), or a 15-foot cube. To recognize this property of the crystal, a sample of it must be studied for an hour by a character who casts spells using material components. {@spell Identify} and {@spell detect magic} don't react to the crystal because it is not, in and of itself, magical. Characters can gather as much of the crystal as they want while they're here, but it becomes inert and loses this useful property a week after being removed from this chamber.": "{@creature fate eater|ToB|fate eaters}没有宝藏，在这个房间里也没有秘密储藏室。然而，这些水晶具有独特的特性。如果将这种水晶的一些粉末形式添加到唤灵法术的普通物质组件中，法术的影响范围可以改变为另一种具有相同体积的形状。例如，闪电箭通常影响包含二十个5英尺正方形的100英尺线。有了这种水晶粉末，闪电箭可以被施展为半径为10英尺的球体，一个15英尺的锥体（注意锥体是三维的），或者一个15英尺的立方体。要认识到这种水晶的特性，必须由一个使用物质组件施法的角色在这个水晶上研究一个小时。{@spell Identify}和{@spell detect magic}不会对这种水晶产生反应，因为它本身并不具有魔法性质。角色可以在这里收集尽可能多的水晶，但是一旦离开这个房间，水晶会变得无效，失去这种有用的特性，一周后会失效。",
	"As protection against enemies raiding their temple site via the Black River, the cultists of Charun who originally inhabited these caves included this trap. If a boat travels along the river that isn't propelled and guided by the flesh golem boatman, rocks thrust up from the river bottom to make it impossible for a boat to get through this stretch of river.": "作为对抗敌人通过黑河袭击他们庙宇的防护，最初居住在这些洞穴中的卡伦(Charun)教徒设置了这个陷阱。如果一条船沿着河流行驶，没有由血肉魔像船工推动和引导，岩石会从河底冲起，使得船只无法通过这段河流。",
	"This trap can spring in either of two ways: kindly or cruelly. When it happens, place the appropriate {@area overlay|SC-508|MO|x} on the map to show where the rocks appear.": "这个陷阱可以以两种方式之一触发：友善或残忍。当它发生时，在地图上放置适当的{@area overlay|SC-508|MO|x}(Rocks)以显示岩石出现的位置。",
	"The first, kinder way is for the rocks to rise up slowly and block the river moments after the golem is destroyed or removed from the boat. If this happens, characters can see the river is blocked before they reach the rocks and change their plan accordingly.": "第一种更温和的方式是当巨像被摧毁或从船上移除后，岩石缓缓升起，堵住河流。如果发生这种情况，角色可以在到达岩石之前看到河流被堵住，并相应地改变他们的计划。",
	"The second, cruel way is for the rocks to rise up rapidly as the characters maneuver the boat through the stretch of water where the rocks appear. The boat takes 22 ({@damage 4d10}) bludgeoning damage as the rising rocks batter it. Place the rocks {@area overlay|SC-508|MO|x} on the river, then position the boat so it's wedged into the rocks next to the entrance to the crystal garden ({@area Area 507|SC-507|x}). The boat can't be moved from that spot unless characters get out and lift it over the rocks (presumably while standing on the rocks themselves). An attack from {@creature lesser scrag|CCodex|scrags}, {@creature cipactli|CCodex}, {@creature Gargoctopus|CCodex|gargoctopi}, and/or {@creature water leaper|ToB|water leapers} is guaranteed during this operation.": "第二种残酷的方式是当角色们操纵船只穿过出现岩石的水域时，岩石迅速升起。船只受到22({@damage 4d10})点钝击伤害，因为上升的岩石猛烈地撞击它。将岩石放置在河流上{@area overlay|SC-508|MO|x}，然后将船只定位在靠近水晶花园入口{@area Area 507|SC-507|x}的岩石旁边。船只无法从那个位置移动，除非角色们下船并将其抬过岩石（大概是站在岩石上）。在这个操作过程中，{@creature lesser scrag|CCodex|scrags}、{@creature cipactli|CCodex}、{@creature Gargoctopus|CCodex|gargoctopi}和/或{@creature water leaper|ToB|water leapers}的攻击是肯定会发生的。",
	"If characters stay in the immobilized boat debating what to do for too long, the river creatures may grow impatient and attack them in the boat.": "如果角色们在被困的船上讨论该怎么办的时间太长，河里的生物可能会变得不耐烦并攻击他们在船上。",
	"Once the rocks appear, they're permanent. Only the cultists of Charun knew how to make them go away, and the cult is long gone. The characters are left with the problem of figuring out how to navigate the monster-infested river with stony teeth obstructing it.": "一旦这些岩石出现，它们就是永久的。只有卡伦教派的信徒知道如何让它们消失，但这个教派早已消失。角色们面临着一个问题，他们需要想办法穿过这条被石头牙齿阻挡的充满怪物的河流。",
	"The floor of this chamber is only inches above the water level of the Black River. The boat can be tied to a steel ring set into the cavern wall.": "这个房间的地板仅仅高出黑河水面几英寸。小船可以系在洞穴墙壁上的一个钢环上。",
	"This chamber contains nothing but an ancient fountain that's become an object of veneration to the deep ones who store their treasure in {@area Area 510|SC-510|x}.": "这个房间里除了一个古老的喷泉外什么也没有，这个喷泉已经成为深渊生物们储藏财宝的神圣物品。深渊生物们把他们的财宝储存在{@area Area 510|SC-510|x}中。",
	"The floor of this small chamber is only inches above the water level of the Black River. The stones are wet and spattered with mud that's formed into rivulets. On the wall opposite the entrance is a fountain. Water trickles from a peculiar, unsettling image of a fish carved into the cavern wall and collects in a basin before spilling out onto the floor.": "这个小房间的地板仅比黑河的水面高出几英寸。石头潮湿，上面溅满了泥巴，形成了细流。在入口对面的墙上有一个喷泉。水从洞穴墙壁上雕刻的一个奇特而令人不安的鱼形象中滴落下来，汇集在一个水盆中，然后溢出到地板上。",
	"The floor of the chamber is slightly slick, not enough to be a hazard, but more than the characters might expect.": "房间的地板略微湿滑，不至于构成危险，但比角色们预期的要多一些。",
	"The design of the fountain is mundane at first glance: a scaly fish standing on its tail, with water burbling out of its mouth and streaming down its fins into the basin. Characters have seen similar fountains in prosperous coastal towns. On closer inspection, however, eerie details are noticed. The eyes and the mouth have an unsettling similarity to human features. The carving is obviously wet from the water running down it, but its oily sheen implies something other than water might be involved. Even the way water dribbles from its mouth becomes increasingly distasteful as characters watch, with hints of convulsive vomiting rather than a steady trickle. Characters experience these thoughts as hints and notions, not as clear perceptions.": "这座喷泉的设计乍一看很平凡：一个鳞片状的鱼站在尾巴上，水从它的嘴里冒出，顺着鳍流进水池。人物们在繁荣的沿海城镇曾见过类似的喷泉。然而，仔细观察时会注意到一些怪异的细节。眼睛和嘴巴与人类特征有令人不安的相似之处。雕刻明显被水浸湿，但其油亮的光泽暗示着可能涉及到除水之外的东西。甚至水从它的嘴里流出的方式在人物观察时变得越来越令人厌恶，带有痉挛呕吐的暗示，而不是稳定的涓涓细流。人物们将这些想法体验为暗示和概念，而不是清晰的感知。",
	"If a character examines the fountain closely, a successful {@dc 13} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals glittery spots at the bottom of the basin. If someone puts their hand in the water and lifts out some of the glitter, they see that it's fish scales. If the check was made with Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) instead, the character gets that information without putting their hand in the water (see also {@item Dagon's Oil|KPSC}).": "如果一个角色仔细检查这个喷泉，一个成功的{@dc 13} 智慧 ({@skill Perception}) 检定会揭示出盆底有闪闪发光的斑点。如果有人把手放进水里捞起一些闪光物，他们会发现那是鱼鳞。如果检定是用智力 ({@skill Investigation}) 进行的，角色会在不用把手放进水里的情况下得到这些信息（另见 {@item Dagon's Oil|KPSC}）。",
	"A follow-up successful {@dc 13} Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check fails to identify the type of fish the scales came from but confirms it's no fish the character has encountered before. If, however, characters have already fought and killed deep ones (in the frog shrine, for example), then a successful {@skill Nature} check confirms the scales are from a deep one.": "一次成功的{@dc 13}智力({@skill Nature})检定未能确定鱼鳞的种类，但确认这不是角色以前遇到过的鱼类。然而，如果角色已经与深渊生物（例如在青蛙神龛中）战斗并杀死过，那么一次成功的{@skill Nature}检定将确认这些鳞片来自深渊生物。",
	"Finally, if the result of the initial {@skill Perception} or {@skill Investigation} check is 15 or higher, the character notices one other thing: there's a small, silvery metal ring lodged in the fish's throat. It can't be reached with a finger but it can be retrieved with a bent wire, a fish hook, or a similar tool. The silvery ring is at the end of a short silver chain attached to a small silver whistle similar to a bosun's pipe. There is nothing particularly special about the whistle; it is worth 5 gp and sounds rather shrill. But characters are likely to want to blow it (see below).": "最后，如果初始{@skill Perception}或{@skill Investigation}检查的结果为15或更高，角色会注意到另一件事：鱼喉部有一个小的银色金属戒指。无法用手指够到，但可以用弯曲的金属丝、鱼钩或类似工具取出。这个银色戒指连接在一条短银链的末端，链子上挂着一个类似水手长笛的小银哨子。这个哨子并没有什么特别之处；价值5 gp，发出尖锐的声音。但角色可能会想要吹响它（见下文）。",
	"The water in the fountain contains small amounts of {@item Dagon's oil|KPSC}. This oil is generated by the fish-fountain and mixes with the water, which is drawn directly from the Black River. It's also why the floor feels slicker than it ought to.": "喷泉中的水含有少量{@item Dagon's oil|KPSC}。这种油是由鱼喷泉产生的，与直接从黑河取出的水混合在一起。这也是为什么地板感觉比应该更滑的原因。",
	"A character who plunges their hands into the fountain, touches the water on the floor (or walks in it barefoot), or handles or blows the silver whistle without first cleaning it thoroughly is exposed to the effects of {@item Dagon's oil|KPSC} {@homebrew |(see the appendix)}.": "一个角色如果在没有彻底清洁的情况下将双手浸入喷泉中，触摸地板上的水（或赤脚走在水中），或者直接处理或吹响银哨，那么他将暴露于 {@item Dagon's oil|KPSC} {@homebrew |(see the appendix)} 的影响之下。",
	"The deep ones who use the Black River as a subterranean highway stash some of the treasure they receive as tribute from fishermen and riverside communities in this cavern. There is significant wealth here, but it's not free for the taking.": "那些利用黑河作为地下高速公路的深渊生物在这个洞穴中储藏了一些他们从渔民和河畔社区收到的贡品中的宝藏。这里有相当可观的财富，但并非白捡的。",
	"Up a short but steep flight of steps is a small chamber and, at its far end, wonderful treasures! Coins, golden jewelry and gems, weapons, silver plate, jeweled goblets, small statues, and crystal idols are strewn across the floor in heaps or piled into chests.": "一段短而陡峭的台阶上是一个小房间，在其远端，有着美妙的宝藏！硬币、黄金首饰和宝石、武器、银器、镶有宝石的高脚杯、小雕像和水晶偶像散落在地板上成堆，或堆放在箱子里。",
	"The treasure here contains both a challenge 0–4 hoard and a challenge 5–10 hoard. You can generate it as you like, either randomly or by design to provide the characters some essential equipment.": "这里的宝藏包含了一个0-4级财宝和一个5-10级财宝。你可以随意生成它，无论是随机生成还是有计划地为角色提供一些必要的装备。",
	"If anything is taken from the hoard, deep ones are instantly aware of it. They immediately swim up the Black River, ready to attack the thieves who are robbing them of their hard-earned (in their bulbous, fishlike eyes) spoils. Before the party is able to leave the combined {@area Areas of 509|SC-509|x} and {@area 510|SC-510|x}, the deep ones arrive and either attack or lay an ambush (your choice). The attacking force consists of one {@creature deep one hybrid priest|ToB} (Tome of Beasts) and two {@creature deep one|ToB|deep ones} (Tome of Beasts) per character. Be sure to note whether characters became marked with {@item Dagon's oil|KPSC} from the archimandrite's font ({@area Area 509|SC-509|x}).": "如果从宝藏中拿走任何东西，深渊生物会立即察觉到。它们立刻游向黑河，准备攻击那些抢走它们辛苦劳动所得战利品的贼人（在它们球形、鱼一样的眼睛中）。在冒险者能够离开联合的{@area Areas of 509|SC-509|x}和{@area 510|SC-510|x}之前，深渊生物就会到达，要么发动攻击，要么设下伏击（由你选择）。进攻的力量包括一个{@creature deep one hybrid priest|ToB}(野兽之书)和每个角色两个{@creature deep one|ToB|deep ones}(野兽之书)。请务必注意角色是否被大主教的圣水池标记为{@item Dagon's oil|KPSC}{@area Area 509|SC-509|x}。",
	"The entrance to this chamber is only inches above the level of the river. The boat can be tied to a steel ring embedded in the cavern wall.": "这个房间的入口仅仅高出河面几英寸。船可以系在洞穴墙壁上嵌入的钢环上。",
	"Entombed here is a {@creature shadow river lord|CCodex} (Creature Codex), although \"imprisoned\" might be a better term. The cultists of Charun knew this creature and occasionally dealt with it out of deference to its inherent connection to the River Styx. When {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} turned the cult away from Charun and toward Vardesain and engineered her own transition into a lich, they trapped the {@creature shadow river lord|CCodex} in this stone sarcophagus and wrapped it in magical seals the creature couldn't break or bypass in watery form. Little did they know they were locking their temple into a centuries-delayed fate they couldn't foretell.": "这里被埋葬的是一个{@creature shadow river lord|CCodex}（生物编码），虽然\"被囚禁\"可能更合适。卡鲁恩的异教徒认识这个生物，偶尔因为它与冥河的固有联系而与之打交道。当{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}将异教徒从卡鲁恩转向瓦德赛恩并策划自己成为一名巫妖时，他们将这个{@creature shadow river lord|CCodex}困在这个石棺中，并用魔法封印包裹着，这种封印是这个生物无法打破或绕过的。他们并不知道他们正在将他们的神殿锁定在一个无法预测的世纪延迟的命运中。",
	"The floor of this large cavern is only inches above the level of the river. At least, most of it is above the river; a portion of the floor must have settled over the years, so water from the Black River runs across the tiles and pools around a stone sarcophagus with an intricately carved lid. The sarcophagus is the only thing in this large chamber.": "这个巨大洞穴的地面仅比河流水平高出几英寸。至少，大部分地面都高于河流；地面的一部分必须在多年来已经下沉，所以黑河的水流过瓷砖，围绕着一个雕刻精美的石棺形成水池。石棺是这个大房间唯一的物品。",
	"The floor didn't sink; it was designed and built this way so water from the river could always surround the sarcophagus. When characters draw near the sarcophagus, they see it stands not in a puddle but in a shallow pool more than a foot deep. Two steps descend from the floor to the pool's bottom. To reach the sarcophagus, characters must stand in the pool.": "地板并没有下沉；它是这样设计和建造的，以便河水可以始终环绕石棺。当角色靠近石棺时，他们看到它不是在一个水坑中，而是在一个超过一英尺深的浅水池中。从地板到水池底部有两个台阶。要到达石棺，角色必须站在水池中。",
	"On closer inspection, characters also see the carvings on the lid are magical invocations in three different scripts and four different languages: {@language Common}, {@language Infernal}, {@language Abyssal}, and {@language Void Speech|ToB}. A character who makes a successful {@dc 13} Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check sees that all the inscriptions are appeals primarily to Vardesain but also to other supernatural entities—some deities, some devils, some names the character doesn't recognize—to keep this enemy of Vardesain in chains for all eternity.": "在仔细检查时，角色们还会看到盖子上的雕刻是用三种不同的文字和四种不同的语言写成的魔法召唤：{@language Common}，{@language Infernal}，{@language Abyssal}和{@language Void Speech|ToB}。进行成功的{@dc 13}智力({@skill Arcana})检定的角色会发现所有的铭文主要是在向瓦德塞因(Vardesain)祈求，但也有其他超自然实体——一些神明，一些恶魔，一些角色不认识的名字——以永远将瓦德塞因的敌人镇压在锁链之中。",
	"The only decorative motif on the sarcophagus is a carving of a large, writhing worm that encircles the box many times. Its mouth is open and poised to swallow a rectangular shape that might represent the sarcophagus itself. Its circular mouth is ringed with multiple rows of teeth, like a shark's mouth; one of those teeth, about 3 inches long, is conspicuously missing.": "石棺上唯一的装饰图案是一条巨大、扭曲的蠕虫雕刻，它环绕着盒子多次。它张着嘴，准备吞下一个或许代表石棺本身的长方形物体。它的圆形嘴巴被多排牙齿环绕，就像鲨鱼的嘴；其中一颗牙齿，大约有3英寸长，明显地不见了。",
	"The sarcophagus was sealed with an {@spell arcane lock} that was amplified by Vardesain himself in response to {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}'s imploring. It's impervious to {@spell knock} spells and was effectively cast at 20th level for purposes of {@spell dispel magic|PHB|dispelling}, making it impossible for characters to break.": "这个石棺被一个{@spell arcane lock}密封，这个{@spell arcane lock}是瓦德赛因亲自加强的，以回应{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}的恳求。它对{@spell knock}法术无效，实际上是以20级的效果施放，用于{@spell dispel magic|PHB|dispelling}，使得角色无法破解。",
	"The only way to open the sarcophagus without divine aid is with the key, which is the enchanted tooth of a {@creature purple worm}. As a reminder of her subservience to Vardesain (who finds liches useful but doesn't entirely trust them), {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} was commanded to wear the key always around her neck. Placing the enchanted tooth into the depression of the missing tooth in the carving breaks the {@spell arcane lock} and releases the shadow river lord.": "只有用钥匙才能打开石棺，而这把钥匙是一只{@creature purple worm}的魔法牙齿。作为对瓦德赛因（他认为巫妖有用但并不完全信任他们）的服从的提醒，{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}被命令始终戴着这把钥匙。将这颗魔法牙齿放入雕刻中缺失牙齿的凹槽中会打破{@spell arcane lock}，释放出影子河之主。",
	"Figuring out how to open this sarcophagus is vital if characters are to defeat {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}.

	"As the sarcophagus lid opens, the entire chamber rumbles and shakes. The floor trembles beneath your feet and sinks with a lurch. Cold water from the Black River rushes into the chamber and swirls around your feet to a depth of three inches, then six inches, then twelve—and it shows no sign of stopping.": "当石棺盖打开时，整个房间颤动摇晃。地板在你脚下颤抖并突然下陷。黑河的冰冷水流涌入房间，围绕着你的脚踝旋转，深度达到三英寸，然后六英寸，再到十二英寸——而且没有任何停止的迹象。",

	"Meanwhile, as the floor continues sinking and the rising water nears your waist, you see shapes swimming into the chamber from the Black River.": "与此同时，随着地板继续下沉，上升的水位接近你的腰部，你看到形状从黑河游入房间。",
	"Without rising, the thing in the sarcophagus is suddenly standing atop the dais. Unless your eyes deceived you, it simply flowed out of the stone box like water, then reformed into a towering humanoid shape connected to the lapping water by streams flowing from beneath its robe.": "不起身，石棺中的东西突然站在台阶上。除非你的眼睛欺骗了你，它就像水一样从石盒中流出，然后重新形成一个高大的人形，与波浪的水相连，水流从它的长袍下流出。",
	"With a flash of light and the sound of cracking bone, a glowing green staff appears in one of the thing's gauntlets. At that signal, the shapes in the water rise up to reveal they're humanoid skeletons clutching scimitars and with unearthly purple light seeping from their ribcages and through their empty eye sockets.": "伴随着一道闪光和骨头碎裂的声音，一根闪闪发光的绿色法杖出现在那个生物的瘦削手套中。在那个信号下，水中的形状升起，显露出它们是人形骷髅，手持弯刀，从它们的胸膛和空洞的眼眶中渗出一种超自然的紫光。",

At the same time, the marked floor squares collapse and drop creatures on them into a 20-foot-deep, glass-lined pit.

If a character escapes from being engulfed in a space that isn't one of this round's numbered locations, the crimson mist in that space dissipates and no longer contains crimson mist.": "如果一个角色在对抗被吞没（Engulf）的豁免检定中失败，并且在赤红雾的下一个回合开始时仍然被吞没，那么赤红雾会正常重新定位，但它也会留在原地与被吞没的角色同在，并且无论新位置的掷骰结果如何，都会继续保持该角色被吞没状态。换句话说，赤红雾在移动位置时始终保持生物被吞没状态。被吞没的角色不会移动。如果一个角色成功逃离被吞没状态，但不是在本回合的编号位置之一，那么该空间中的赤红雾会消散，不再存在赤红雾。",

	"If the crimson mist is slain, {@creature Brutwer|KPSC} devotes herself to the characters' destruction. The river creatures fear her. She can easily compel obedience from the scrags, and she can enlist help from the gargoctopi or cipactlis with a little more effort. Even the deep ones might cooperate with her under the right circumstances. The water leapers don't respond to persuasion or intimidation, and the shadow skeletons obey only the shadow river lord.

	"Once {@creature Brutwer|KPSC} sets her mind on vengeance, she is a threat to the characters every time they travel on the river or enter a chamber off the river. She can hit someone with {@spell bestow curse} when they get into a battle. She can use {@spell modify memory} on a character to erase vital information. With Call the Blood she can render someone {@condition blinded|PHB|blind}, {@condition deafened|PHB|deaf}, or unable to speak during critical moments of a fight. If characters killed {@creature the boatman|KPSC}, she can easily steal the boat while they explore a chamber and have river creatures ambush them if they try to swim away. {@creature The boatman|KPSC} will carry her by boat if she pays—taking the boat away from the characters' location in the process.": "一旦{@creature Brutwer|KPSC}下定决心要复仇，她就会成为角色们每次在河上旅行或进入河边的房间时的威胁。她可以在他们卷入战斗时使用{@spell bestow curse}攻击某人。她可以使用{@spell modify memory}来抹去重要信息。通过召唤鲜血，她可以在战斗关键时刻让某人变得{@condition blinded|PHB|blind}、{@condition deafened|PHB|deaf}或者无法言语。如果角色们杀死了{@creature the boatman|KPSC}，她可以轻松地在他们探索房间时偷走船只，并让河边生物在他们试图游泳逃走时伏击他们。{@creature The boatman|KPSC}会在她支付费用的情况下带她乘船——从而带走角色们的船只。",
	"Without significant magic to help them, the characters can't hunt her down. {@creature Brutwer|KPSC} casts {@spell water breathing} at will, so she simply swims a few hundred yards away and waits until they stop searching.": "没有显著的魔法帮助，角色们无法追捕她。{@creature Brutwer|KPSC}可以随意施放{@spell water breathing}，所以她只是游到几百码外等待，直到他们停止搜索。",

If you like, make two skill checks: a Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check for {@creature Brutwer|KPSC} ({@skillCheck deception 7}) and a Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check for Gellert ({@skillCheck insight 8}) to see whether he believes her account. If he does, one possible course for him would be this: if characters talk to him instead of immediately attacking, he tells them the hag that's been troubling them is hiding in the cursed cave ({@area Area 504|SC-504|x}). Then he ambushes them as they reemerge from the submerged passage.": "她甚至可能请求格勒特的帮助，但这不太可能；他对别人的争吵不感兴趣。{@creature Brutwer|KPSC} 至少警告格勒特危险的冒险者已经到来，她把情况描述得好像他们特意来这里杀他，无论真假。格勒特如何处理这些信息由你决定。如果你愿意，可以进行两次技能检定：一个魅力检定 ({@skill Deception}) 为 {@creature Brutwer|KPSC} ({@skillCheck deception 7})，和一个智慧检定 ({@skill Insight}) 为格勒特 ({@skillCheck insight 8})，看看他是否相信她的陈述。如果他相信了，他可能会采取以下行动之一：如果角色与他交谈而不是立即攻击，他会告诉他们一直困扰他们的女巫藏在被诅咒的洞穴 ({@area Area 504|SC-504|x}) 里。然后在他们从水下通道重新出现时伏击他们。",
	"{@creature Brutwer|KPSC} recovers health by resting the same way characters do; she recovers fully during a long rest, and she has {@dice 21d8} Hit Dice to use during short rests.

	"When a character indicates they're taking a closer look at a face, it moves. The mouth opens and closes in silent mimicry of speech, and empty eyelids flutter.": "当一个角色表示他们正在仔细观察一个脸时，它会移动。嘴巴无声地模仿着说话，空洞的眼睑飘动着。",
	"These are the faces {@creature Brutwer|KPSC} tore off unfortunate adventurers and travelers along the Black River. She kept them on display here. The faces aren't alive but they're animated objects with AC 18, 20 hit points, flying speed of 30 feet, and no attacks. They leap from the wall and flutter around the room like grotesque moths, trying to attach themselves to characters' faces or crawl into their backpacks and pouches. The faces have no ability to actually harm anyone but the characters don't know that. Everyone in the room when the faces \"come alive\" must make a successful {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute or until the faces are destroyed.": "这些是{@creature Brutwer|KPSC}沿着黑河撕下的不幸冒险者和旅行者的脸。她把它们陈列在这里。这些脸不是活的，但它们是有生气的物体，具有AC 18、20点生命值、飞行速度30英尺，没有攻击。它们从墙上跳下来，在房间里飘来飘去，像怪诞的飞蛾一样，试图附着在角色的脸上或爬进他们的背包和袋子里。这些脸没有能力真正伤害任何人，但角色不知道这一点。当脸“活过来”时，房间里的每个人都必须进行成功的{@dc 15}感知豁免才能在1分钟内或直到这些脸被摧毁前不会变成{@condition frightened}。",
	"Be vague about how many faces were here. Odds are no one counted as they entered the chamber, and once the faces were in flight, they were impossible to count. After characters have destroyed a number of faces equaling twice the number of characters in the party, none remain.": "在这里的面孔数量模糊不清。很可能没有人在进入房间时进行过计数，而一旦这些面孔开始飞舞起来，就不可能再进行计数。当角色们摧毁的面孔数量等于队伍中角色数量的两倍时，所有面孔都消失了。",
	"At least, none they can see. Unless they immediately spend 10 minutes searching all their packs and bags, {@dice 2d4} faces squirmed into their gear and will pop out at the most unsettling times: when someone reaches into a pouch for a potion or a scroll, they put their fingers through two eyeholes; when someone readies a shield, they see a bloody face staring back at them; when someone uncorks a waterskin, they find themselves lip-to-lip with a hideously stretched and deformed visage. A {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw to avoid {@condition frightened|PHB|fright} is appropriate in any of these cases. In some situations, this will only be for flavor; however, if these things happen mid-combat or during a rest, the failed saving throw can be quite detrimental.": "至少在他们看不见的情况下。 除非他们立即花费10分钟搜索他们所有的包和袋子，否则，{@dice 2d4}的脸会扭曲进他们的装备中，并在最令人不安的时候跳出来：当有人伸手到袋子里拿药水或卷轴时，他们的手指会穿过两个眼洞；当有人准备好盾牌时，他们会看到一个血腥的脸盯着他们；当有人拔开水袋塞子时，他们会发现自己与一个丑陋拉伸和变形的面孔贴唇相对。在任何这些情况下，进行{@dc 15}的感受力豁免才是合适的，以避免{@condition frightened|PHB|fright}。在某些情况下，这只是为了增加趣味性；然而，如果这些事情发生在战斗中或休息期间，未通过的豁免检定可能会带来相当大的不利影响。",
	"The point of the faces is to be creepy and a little amusing. Don't drag it out too long or dredge it up too often. If characters search their gear specifically for lurking faces, they find them and destroy them without much trouble.": "这些面具的作用是让人感到毛骨悚然，有点好笑。不要拖得太久或者太频繁地提起它们。如果角色专门搜索他们的装备寻找潜伏的面具，他们会很容易地找到并摧毁它们。",
	"The door is heavy oak reinforced with steel bands. The hinges are on this side, so it opens by pulling (into this room).

	"Being roped together provides advantage only if the rope is taut. If characters have 10 feet of rope between them but they're standing 5 feet apart, the rope doesn't help on their saving throws. It might still prevent them from tumbling as far down the steps.": "只有当绳子绷紧时，被绑在一起才能获得优势。如果角色之间有10英尺的绳子，但他们相距5英尺，绳子对他们的豁免扑克没有帮助。但它可能仍然防止他们在台阶上摔倒时摔得更远。",
	"A better plan than tying themselves together is simply tying a rope to one of the stone columns at the entrance to the gallery and tossing it down the stairs. The wind will pull the end all the way to {@area Area 601|SC-601|x} if the rope is long enough. Characters can then \"climb\" or rappel down the rope. A character who climbs with their hands only needs to make a successful {@dc 8} Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to keep their grip.

Their broken, rusty dagger lies on the ground nearby.": "这扇门是由被烧黑的钢铁制成的。门上凸起着一个巨大蠕虫咬住一个头骨的符号。一个成功的{@dc 10}智力({@skill Religion})检定的角色会认出这个图案是瓦德赛恩(Vardesain)教派的标志，他是饥饿之神，食尸鬼和达拉库尔的主保神，也是灵魂吞噬者。在符号下方的金属上粗糙地刻着字母D O N O。很久以前，有人试图留下警告“不要进入”或“不要打开”，但在他们完成之前被{@creature phantom wight|KPSC|phantom wights}打断并杀死。他们破损生锈的匕首就躺在附近的地上。",
	"The door is locked; the lock can be opened with a successful {@dc 15} Dexterity ({@item Thieves' Tools|PHB}) check.": "门被锁住了；成功进行 {@dc 15} 敏捷 ((Dexterity)) 检定可以打开锁。",
	"You're at the entrance to an immense chamber with vaulted ceilings supported by six massive columns. Flickering green light dimly illuminates the chamber. The light emanates from two bronze braziers at the north end of the room. The northern portion of the room is elevated five feet above the rest of the floor, with steps leading up to it. At the center of the raised portion stands a pale gray seat. At this distance and in this eerie light, you can't tell if it's made from stone, metal, or bone.": "你站在一个巨大的大厅入口处，穹顶由六根巨大的柱子支撑着。摇曳的绿光微弱地照亮了大厅。光线来自房间北端的两个青铜火盆。房间的北部高出地面五英尺，有台阶通往上面。在高起部分的中央矗立着一个苍白的座位。在这个距离和这种诡异的光线下，你无法分辨它是由石头、金属还是骨头制成的。",
	"The walls of the room are decorated with life-size paintings of warriors in full harness and with weapons drawn. They're portrayed standing in open doorways of various shapes, but all appear to be paintings on the plaster-covered walls.": "房间的墙壁装饰着生活大小的画作，描绘了穿着全副武装、手持武器的战士们。他们被描绘站在各种形状的门口，但所有的画作看起来都是在覆盖着灰泥的墙壁上。",
	"In the northwest and southeast corners of the room are two more blackened steel doors similar to the one you just opened.": "在房间的西北角和东南角分别有两扇与你刚刚打开的那扇类似的被烧黑的钢门。",
	"When the characters first enter, the braziers are barely alight.": "当角色们第一次进入时，火盆只是微微闪烁着光芒。",
	"As characters move farther into the chamber, paraphrase the following for them.": "随着角色们进入房间的深处，为他们解释以下内容。",
	"When someone moves north of the two southernmost columns, the fires intensify so green flames can be seen flickering above the braziers' rims.": "当有人移动到最南面两列的北面时，火焰会加剧，绿色火焰可以看到在火盆边缘闪烁。",
	"Moments after the flames intensify, a sound like the roar of a lion drowning in slime is heard coming through the door in the northwest corner of the chamber. That's followed by a chain dragging across stone, then snapping taut with such force that everyone feels the stone floor shudder through the soles of their feet. {@creature The chained thing|KPSC} in {@area Area 517|SC-517|x} is awake.": "在火焰加剧的瞬间，一阵像狮子陷入泥沼中咆哮的声音从房间西北角的门传来。接着是铁链拖过石头的声音，然后被猛力拉紧，以至于每个人都感觉到石地板在脚底下颤动。{@creature The chained thing|KPSC} 在 {@area Area 517|SC-517|x} 中醒来。",
	"The first time someone moves north of the middle two columns, the braziers intensify once more and green smoke billows from them. A disturbance in the air similar to heat surrounds the throne for a few seconds. When it passes, a suit of ancient armor wrapped in a tattered cloak sits upon the pale gray seat. Green mist wafts through the joints in the armor and green light flickers through the eye slots in the helmet. A broken, dislocated skeletal jaw droops uselessly below the faceplate.": "第一次有人向中间两列的北方移动时，火盆再次加强，绿烟从中卷起。类似于热量的空气扰动环绕王座几秒钟。当它消失时，一套古代盔甲裹着一件破旧的斗篷坐在苍白的座位上。绿雾从盔甲的接缝中飘出，绿光从头盔的眼孔中闪烁。一个破碎的，脱臼的骷髅下颚无力地垂在面罩下方。",
	"If characters stick around, call for initiative rolls.": "如果角色留在原地，就要求进行先攻骰（initiative rolls）。",
	"The creature on the pale seat is {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}. She was the final, corrupt leader of the cult of Charun in these caves. She twisted the cult to worshiping the darkest aspects of Vardesain, and in death she became a {@creature hierophant lich|CCodex} (Creature Codex). This is her tomb. She does not abide intruders or looters.": "苍白座位上的生物是{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}。她是这些洞穴中查伦邪教的最后一个腐化领袖。她扭曲了邪教，使其崇拜瓦德赛恩最黑暗的一面，在死后成为了{@creature hierophant lich|CCodex}（生物宝典）。这是她的坟墓。她不容忍闯入者或掠夺者。",
	"The 5-foot space containing {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}'s throne is surrounded by a permanent {@spell antimagic field}. She retreats to this field only when the crypt is free of enemies. She wants to be able to cast spells otherwise.": "包含{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}王座的5英尺空间被一个永久{@spell antimagic field}所环绕。只有在地下室没有敌人时，她才会撤退到这个领域。否则，她希望能够施放法术。",
	"{@creature Llagfel|KPSC} wears what appears to be a 3-inch-long shark's tooth on a gold chain around her neck. It is a tooth from a {@creature purple worm}, but more importantly, it's the key that breaks the divine {@spell arcane lock} on the sarcophagus of the {@creature shadow river lord|CCodex}. To get the key, characters must either pluck it off {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}'s temporarily lifeless corpse (easy) after reducing her to 0 hit points (not so easy), or snatch it from her during combat. Snatching it away during combat requires only a successful hit against {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}'s armor class of 14 with an empty hand. She takes no special precautions to protect the tooth, since it never occurs to her that anyone else would even know what it is. She wears it only because Vardesain demands it.": "{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}戴着一条看起来有3英寸长的金链子上的鲨鱼牙。这是一颗来自{@creature purple worm}的牙齿，但更重要的是，它是打破{@creature shadow river lord|CCodex}棺材上神圣{@spell arcane lock}的关键。要获得这把钥匙，角色们必须在将{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}减至0点生命值后（不太容易）从她暂时失去生命的尸体上拔下它（容易），或者在战斗中从她手中夺取。在战斗中夺取它只需要用空手对着{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}的护甲等级14成功攻击。她没有特别的防护措施来保护这颗牙齿，因为她从未想到其他人会知道这是什么。她只是因为瓦德塞因的要求才戴着它。",
	"If two attempts to snatch the tooth fail, {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} catches on that the characters know more than she thought they did. She wrenches off the necklace and grips it in her hand from then on; the only way to get it then is to pry it from her cold, dead fingers, unless characters come up with something more creative. Note {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} has {@sense truesight} and a passive {@skill Perception} of 19, so sending a rogue to sneak up on her invisibly is unlikely to work.": "如果两次抢夺牙齿的尝试失败，{@creature Llagfel|KPSC} 意识到这些角色知道的比她想象的要多。她拧下项链，从那时起紧握在手中；除非角色们想出更有创意的方法，否则唯一的办法就是从她冰冷的死手中撬下来。请注意，{@creature Llagfel|KPSC} 拥有{@sense truesight} 和被动{@skill Perception} 为19，因此派遣一个盗贼悄悄接近她是不太可能成功的。",
	"The sixteen niches lining the walls of this room mark the locations of the painted warriors, which portray the sixteen warriors who served {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} most loyally during her lifetime. Inside these niches are sixteen {@creature phantom wight|KPSC|phantom wights} (see the appendix). Four of them (or {@dice 1d3 + 2} if you prefer) join the combat each round. The phantom wights simply pass through the painted plaster over the doors of their tombs to reach the battle.": "这个房间墙壁上排列着十六个壁龛，标志着绘制士兵的位置，描绘了在{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}一生中最忠诚的十六名士兵。这些壁龛内有十六个{@creature phantom wight|KPSC|phantom wights}（见附录）。其中四个（或者{@dice 1d3 + 2}，如果你更喜欢）每回合加入战斗。幻影厉鬼只是穿过墓室门上的涂料石膏来到战斗现场。",
	"If your group of 8th-level characters is so outrageously powerful that it can defeat the unstoppable undead here, you should beef up the undead. Make all {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}'s myrmidons {@creature wraith|MM|wraiths} or even {@creature spectral guardian|ToB|spectral guardians} (Tome of Beasts).": "如果你的8级角色小组实力强大到可以击败这里的无敌不死生物，那么你应该加强这些不死生物。将所有{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}的士兵改为{@creature wraith|MM|wraiths}或者甚至{@creature spectral guardian|ToB|spectral guardians}(野兽之书)。",
	"The braziers burn with an unholy fire that can't be extinguished. Even capping them won't contain the incorporeal smoke. The smoke from the braziers has two effects.": "那些火盆燃烧着一种不可熄灭的邪恶火焰。即使盖住它们也无法控制那些无形的烟雾。这些火盆散发出的烟雾有两种效果。",
	"First, it gives undead in this chamber advantage on saving throws against turning effects.": "首先，这个房间里的不死生物在面对(*turning effects*)时拥有优势保存 throw。",
	"Second, it carries a withering miasma throughout the chamber. A living creature that starts its turn in the smoke (which fills the chamber and the small landing outside the chamber entrance if the door is open) must make a successful {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or take 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage and have its hit point maximum reduced by the same amount. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. This is a supernatural effect, not poison. The smoke doesn't need to be inhaled to cause harm, so holding one's breath provides no protection against it.": "其次，它在整个房间中弥漫着一种枯萎的瘴气。任何生物如果在烟雾中开始它的回合（如果门是开着的，烟雾会充满整个房间和房间入口外的小平台），必须进行一次成功的{@dc 15}体质豁免才能避免受到9({@damage 2d8})点死灵伤害，并且其生命值上限会减少相同数量。这种减少效果会持续直到生物完成一次长休。这是一种超自然效应，不是毒素。即使不吸入烟雾，也会受到伤害，因此屏住呼吸对其无效。",
	"Be sure to read the descriptions of {@area Area 517|SC-517|x} and {@creature the chained thing|KPSC} before trying to stage this battle! {@creature The chained thing|KPSC} has a pronounced effect on what happens in the tomb. In short, {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} and her myrmidons can't be destroyed while {@creature the chained thing|KPSC} exists; they can be reduced to 0 hit points temporarily, but 2 rounds later they return to full hit points and rejoin the fight.": "在尝试发动这场战斗之前，请务必阅读{@area Area 517|SC-517|x}和{@creature the chained thing|KPSC}的描述！{@creature The chained thing|KPSC}对墓穴中发生的事情有显著影响。简而言之，只要{@creature the chained thing|KPSC}存在，{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}和她的侍从就无法被摧毁；它们可以被暂时降为0点生命值，但2回合后它们会恢复满生命值并重新加入战斗。",
	"Equally important is understanding the situation surrounding the shadow river lord in the flooding crypt ({@area Area 511|SC-511|x}).": "同样重要的是理解洪水地下室中影子河领主的情况({@area Area 511|SC-511|x})。",
	"If the shadow river lord's sarcophagus hasn't been opened yet when characters trigger the fight against {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}, they're on their own and should be guaranteed to get whipped.

It's best if players realize that on their own.": "如果角色在触发与{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}的战斗时，暗影河领主的石棺尚未被打开，他们将独自面对，并应该被保证会受到惩罚。不要急于指出他们处境的绝望。最好让玩家自己意识到这一点。",
	"If the shadow river lord's sarcophagus has been opened, then the river lord precedes characters into the chamber and ten shadow skeletons follow. It and its shadow skeletons engage {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} and the phantom wights in a battle for supremacy.": "如果影子河领主的石棺已经被打开，那么河领主会在角色们之前进入房间，跟着十个影子骷髅。它和它的影子骷髅们会与{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}和幻影厉鬼展开一场争夺统治权的战斗。",
	"Once the shadow river lord arrives, this scene turns into a larger battle than is common in tabletop RPGs. Included here are several shortcuts you can use to keep from getting bogged down in endless dice rolls and damage tracking.": "一旦暗影河领主到来，这场景就会变成比桌面角色扮演游戏中常见的更大规模的战斗。以下是一些快捷方式，可以帮助你避免陷入无休止的掷骰和伤害追踪中。",
	"{@creature Llagfel|KPSC} and her myrmidons hate the shadow river lord and shadow skeletons far more than they dislike the characters; their animosity stretches back centuries. Characters should pick up on this quickly and realize they're being given a chance to accomplish something other than just fighting for their lives again in this chamber. If they don't, the shadow river lord can rasp out a brief command along the lines of \"the shrine, you fools!\"": "{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}和她的侍从们对暗影河领主和暗影骷髅的仇恨远远超过了他们对角色的厌恶；他们之间的敌意可以追溯到几个世纪以前。角色应该很快意识到这一点，并意识到他们有机会完成的不仅仅是在这个房间里为了生存而战斗。如果他们没有意识到这一点，暗影河领主可以嘶哑地下达一个简短的命令，类似于“神龛，你们这些蠢货！”",
	"The shadow river lord and shadow skeletons try to establish a line across the crypt roughly from the southeast corner diagonally to the northwest. They use columns as obstacles in their line. Phantom wights, however, are incorporeal; they can pass through enemies if they need to, so no line can hold them back for long. If shadow skeletons are falling too quickly, more can straggle in from the river.": "暗影河领主和暗影骷髅试图在地下室大致从东南角到西北角对角线上建立一道防线。他们利用柱子作为阻碍物。然而，幻影厉鬼是无实体的；他们可以穿过敌人，所以没有任何防线能够长时间阻止他们。如果暗影骷髅下降得太快，更多的骷髅可以从河流中杂乱而来。",
	"Your goal during this scene is to keep the action as exciting as possible. One or two characters should be able to open the shrine and retrieve the items. The rest should be up to their necks in battling phantom wights and keeping them away from their comrades.": "在这个场景中，你的目标是保持行动尽可能令人兴奋。一两个角色应该能够打开神龛并取回物品。其他人则应该全力与幽灵战斗，确保他们远离同伴，甚至深陷其中。",
	"To speed things along, use this simplified combat system when phantom wights and shadow skeletons fight each other. Both phantom wights and shadow skeletons have Multiattack, but in this simplified combat, make just one roll per attacker.

	"Attacks by the characters are resolved normally.

	"As noted, your priority during this fight is to keep the action moving rapidly and keep the scene as exciting as possible. Don't allow characters to skate through unscathed while the undead only fight each other. The characters must be drawn into the battle to the extent they can handle. If your group has more than four characters or they're uncommonly lethal, reduce the number of shadow skeletons to compensate.": "如前所述，在这场战斗中，你的首要任务是保持战斗迅速发展，让场景尽可能地令人兴奋。不要让角色毫发无伤地轻松过关，而不让不死生物只互相战斗。角色必须被卷入战斗中，但要在他们能够处理的范围内。如果你的团队有四个以上的角色，或者他们的杀伤力异常高，可以减少暗影骷髅的数量来补偿。",
	"It should take characters 5 or 6 rounds to reach the shrine ({@area Area 516|SC-516|x}), open it, recover the staff and the lamp, dash or fight their way to the north end of the crypt, and open the second door. By the time characters open the door to {@area Area 517|SC-517|x}, you want the shadow river lord's force to be on the verge of collapse. If that isn't happening, turn {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}'s attention away from the shadow river lord and against the shadow skeletons to whittle them down, or turn her against the characters to slow them down.": "角色们应该花费5或6轮时间到达神龛{@area Area 516|SC-516|x}，打开它，取回法杖和灯，冲刺或与敌人战斗到地下室北端，并打开第二扇门。当角色们打开{@area Area 517|SC-517|x}的门时，你希望影子河之主的力量濒临崩溃。如果这种情况没有发生，将{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}的注意力从影子河之主转移到影子骷髅上，削弱它们，或者将她转向角色们以减缓他们的速度。",
	"This is one of the climactic scenes of the adventure. It's a bad one to blunder your way through on a first try. {@i We strongly recommend rehearsing this battle in solitaire play} a few times before running it for your group. That's doubly important if this type of action is new to you. To get the most impact from the scene, you must have a good feel for what the forces can do to each other and how quickly or slowly the undead fighters wipe each other out. The only way to know that is to try it beforehand and see it in action with dice and figures or tokens on the map. Even without any involvement from the characters, a dress rehearsal is vital to make the scene fast-paced and thrilling.": "这是冒险中的高潮场景之一。第一次尝试时，这是一个容易出错的场景。在为你的小组运行之前，多试几次{@i We strongly recommend rehearsing this battle in solitaire play}。如果这种类型的行动对你来说是新的，那就更加重要了。为了让场景产生最大的影响，你必须对各种力量之间的相互作用有一个良好的感觉，以及不死战士们是如何迅速或缓慢地消灭彼此的。唯一了解这一点的方法就是事先尝试一下，用骰子和地图上的角色或代币来实际操作。即使没有角色的参与，一次彩排对于使场景紧凑而扣人心弦至关重要。",
	"Once {@creature the chained thing|KPSC} is destroyed, {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} and her myrmidons can be slain.

	"If you've paced everything perfectly, after the battle, characters are faced with the matter of what, if anything, to do about the shadow river lord. It was a vital ally in this battle to vanquish {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}, but it's also unquestionably evil. In a nutshell, their options are to let bygones be bygones and keep moving, or to try to destroy the powerful undead. If they don't destroy it, the river lord takes possession of the crypt as its new lair. If characters try to prevent the shadow river lord from setting up headquarters in the crypt or try to claim {@item Vardesain's Ghastly Stave|KPSC} or the {@item ghoul light|KPSC}, that's sufficient cause for it to attack them. The shadow river lord is not their friend and doesn't consider them equals. They were useful in obtaining its revenge; perhaps they could be of further use replenishing the thinned ranks of fallen shadow skeletons.": "如果你已经安排好一切，战斗结束后，角色们将面临如何处理影子河领主的问题，如果有的话。在消灭{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}的战斗中，它是一个重要的盟友，但它也无疑是邪恶的。简而言之，他们的选择是不计前嫌继续前行，或者试图摧毁这个强大的不死生物。如果他们不摧毁它，河领主将占领地下室作为它的新巢穴。如果角色们试图阻止影子河领主在地下室设立总部，或者试图索取{@item Vardesain's Ghastly Stave|KPSC}或{@item ghoul light|KPSC}，这足以让它攻击他们。影子河领主并不是他们的朋友，也不认为他们是平等的。他们在实现它的复仇中很有用；也许他们可以进一步帮助补充那些减少的倒下的影子骷髅的人数。",
	"{@item Vardesain's Ghastly Stave|KPSC} and the {@item ghoul light|KPSC} are the most obvious treasures here, but they're not tremendously useful and are cursed to boot. A hidden compartment in the base of the throne can be found with a successful {@dc 18} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check; it contains a jeweled crown worth 2,000 gp, a {@item belt of dwarvenkind}, one dose of {@item dust of dryness}, and a {@item Spell Scroll (7th Level)|DMG|spell scroll} of {@spell delayed blast fireball}. The sixteen individual burial chambers hidden behind the paintings of {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}'s myrmidons each contains a challenge 5–10 individual treasure (or assume an average of 75 gp per myrmidon, if you don't want to roll each one separately).": "{@item Vardesain's Ghastly Stave|KPSC} 和 {@item ghoul light|KPSC} 是这里最明显的宝藏，但它们并不是非常有用，而且还带着诅咒。在宝座底座的一个隐藏隔间里，通过成功的 {@dc 18} 智慧检定 ({@skill Perception}) 可以找到一个镶有宝石的皇冠，价值 2,000 金币，一个 {@item belt of dwarvenkind}，一剂 {@item dust of dryness}，以及 {@item Spell Scroll (7th Level)|DMG|spell scroll} 个 {@spell delayed blast fireball}。隐藏在 {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} 的侍从画像后面的十六个个别的墓室中，每个都包含一个5-10级的挑战宝藏（或者假设每个侍从平均 75 金币，如果你不想分别掷骰）。",
	"Take note while characters are finding a way into this chamber and examining its contents, they are probably still subject to the Withering Miasma of the green braziers in {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}'s crypt and may be under attack by phantom wights and {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}.": "当角色们试图进入这个房间并检查其中的内容时，请注意他们可能仍然受到{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}的地穴中枯萎瘴气的影响，并可能遭遇幽灵厉鬼和{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}的攻击。",
	"The door to this room is blackened steel. It has no standard lock but is sealed with {@spell arcane lock}. Opening it requires a successful {@dc 28} Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. {@spell Dispel magic} removes the {@spell arcane lock}, or {@spell knock} suppresses it for 10 minutes; in either case, the door can then be opened easily. Structurally, the door has AC 19 and 20 hit points. The door is also protected by a {@spell glyph of warding} that's triggered if the door is attacked or if {@spell knock} is cast on it, but not if it's dispelled.

It may have been an idol of Charun at one time, but it isn't any longer. {@creature The boatman|KPSC}'s oar has been replaced with a wooden staff topped by a leering human skull. What appear to be human teeth are hammered into the staff along its whole length, and jawbones are lashed to it with strips of desiccated gut. More gut, dyed purple, is wrapped around the staff near the skull in a manner that suggests a bloated worm. A rusted lantern hangs from a notch hacked into the statue's left hand. Beneath the drooping hood, Charun's face has been chiseled into a caricature of a skull. The skull effect is crudely heightened by flaking, chalky white paint.": "这个小房间里除了钢门外，唯一的东西就是一个九英尺高的披风人形雕像。它曾经可能是查伦的偶像，但现在不再是了。{@creature The boatman|KPSC}的桨已被一个木杖取代，杖顶端是一个狞笑的人类头骨。看起来像是人类的牙齿被钉在整个木杖上，下颚骨被用干瘪的肠条捆绑在上面。更多的染成紫色的肠被缠绕在靠近头骨处的木杖上，看起来像是一条膨胀的蠕虫。一个生锈的灯笼挂在雕像左手上被砍出的凹槽里。在下垂的兜帽下，查伦的脸被雕刻成一个颅骨的滑稽形象。这种颅骨效果被剥落的粉笔白色油漆粗糙地突出。",
	"The wall behind the statue is painted with an equally crude portrayal of green flames, as if the statue were standing in an unnatural green fire. Before your eyes, the painted flames begin to flicker and dance.": "雕像后面的墙壁上涂满了同样粗糙的绿色火焰描绘，仿佛雕像站在一团不自然的绿色火焰中。在你眼前，涂画的火焰开始闪烁起舞。",

They can be removed from the statue easily.": "这根法杖和这盏灯笼都是神奇的，在用探测魔法检查时会显示出变化魔法。这盏灯笼是{@item ghoul light|KPSC}，而法杖是{@item Vardesain's Ghastly Stave|KPSC} {@homebrew |(see the appendix)}。这两件物品都被诅咒了。它们对应处理{@creature the chained thing|KPSC} 在 {@area Area 517|SC-517|x} 中至关重要。它们可以很容易地从雕像上取下。",
	"{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}'s phylactery, which is immune to damage, is hidden inside the statue. To find it, the statue must be tipped over to reveal a hollow space in its base. Inside the hollow is a mummified quipper with gold and silver accents sewn along its fins and gills and with aquamarine stones in its eye sockets. The easiest way to destroy it here is to toss it into the {@item sphere of annihilation} on Level 6. Gellert will take it off the characters' hands if they ask, but he won't say what he has in mind for it. That's a temporary solution at best, since the characters are likely to fight Gellert to the death eventually. The library automatons might be persuaded to take the phylactery and abandon it sometime in the far future. The fate eaters express great interest in it if characters still have it during that conversation; they gladly take it, but like Gellert, don't explain their intentions for it. Tossing the phylactery through the portal in {@area Area 505|SC-505|x} into the plateau of Leng is guaranteed to have unfortunate consequences. {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}'s body can't reform while the phylactery is in the illumination from the {@item ghoul light|KPSC}, for as long as characters can keep it lit. Outside the Scarlet Citadel, the choice of what can destroy {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}'s phylactery is up to you.": "{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}的魂器被藏在雕像内部，免疫任何伤害。要找到它，必须把雕像推倒，揭示底座内的空洞。空洞内有一只干尸鱼，鳍和鳃上缝有金银装饰，眼眶里镶有海蓝宝石。在这里摧毁它的最简单方法是将其扔进第6层的{@item sphere of annihilation}。如果角色询问，盖勒特会帮忙处理，但他不会透露他的打算。这只是一个临时解决方案，因为角色最终可能会与盖勒特战斗到死。图书馆自动人偶可能会被说服接管魂器，并在遥远的未来的某个时候放弃它。如果角色在那次对话中仍然拥有它，命运吞噬者会表现出极大的兴趣；他们乐意接收，但像盖勒特一样，不会解释他们的意图。将魂器扔进{@area Area 505|SC-505|x}的传送门，进入莱恩高原，将会带来不幸的后果。只要角色能保持灯火照亮，{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}的身体在魂器暴露在{@item ghoul light|KPSC}的光照下时无法重组。在绯红城堡外，能摧毁{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}的魂器的选择取决于你。",
	"This chamber is sealed behind another blackened steel door like the other two. It can be opened only one way: by striking it with {@item Vardesain's Ghastly Stave|KPSC}. No other attack or magic opens it.": "这个房间被另一扇像其他两扇一样被烧黑的钢门封闭。它只能通过用{@item Vardesain's Ghastly Stave|KPSC}来打开。没有其他攻击或魔法可以打开它。",
	"When the stave is brought within 15 feet of the door, the door glows with a pale light. Within 5 feet, the glowing outline of a skull can be seen on the door. Striking that glowing skull with the skull on {@item Vardesain's Ghastly Stave|KPSC} causes the skull to emit a long, raspy moan and the door to swing open into the chamber.": "当法杖被带到门口15英尺内时，门会发出淡淡的光芒。在5英尺内，可以看到门上闪烁着一个头骨的轮廓。用{@item Vardesain's Ghastly Stave|KPSC}上的头骨击中那个闪烁的头骨会导致头骨发出长长的沙哑呻吟声，门随之打开通往房间。",
	"As the steel door swings away, a stench of death and rot rolls out of the cave beyond and washes past you. You hear the sound of a chain being dragged across stone, then something lunges into view from the darkness. Heavy chains wrapped around its misshapen body prevent it from reaching the doorway.": "当钢门摇摆开时，一股死亡和腐烂的恶臭从洞穴中散发出来，冲过你。你听到链条在石头上拖动的声音，然后有什么东西从黑暗中扑向你。沉重的链条缠绕在它畸形的身体上，阻止它到达门口。",
	"The thing is not humanoid, but it has humanoid elements. Eyes, mouths, even limbs, but none of it is where you'd expect it to be. Its flesh appears fungal, but it looks and smells like putrid meat. The creature lunges again and again in mindless fury.": "这个东西不是人形的，但它有人形的元素。眼睛，嘴巴，甚至肢体，但它们都不在你期望的位置。它的肉看起来像真菌，但看起来和闻起来像腐烂的肉。这个生物一次又一次地发狂地扑过来。",
	"{@creature The chained thing|KPSC} is secured to the chain depicted on the map. The chain prevents it from moving more than 10 feet from the point where the chain is anchored to the stone wall (there can be no more than two empty map squares between the anchor and {@creature the chained thing|KPSC}). This still allows it to roam through most of the cavern.": "{@creature The chained thing|KPSC} 被固定在地图上所示的链条上。 这条链子防止它离开与石墙锚定的点超过10英尺（锚点和{@creature the chained thing|KPSC} 之间不得有超过两个空地图方块）。 这仍然允许它在洞穴的大部分区域自由移动。",
	"Radiant damage is the key to defeating {@creature the chained thing|KPSC}. If characters don't have a dependable source of radiant damage, the {@item ghoul light|KPSC} is. It does only 1 radiant damage per round (doubled to 2 by {@creature the chained thing|KPSC}'s vulnerability), but it prevents {@creature the chained thing|KPSC} from regenerating and from rejuvenating {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} and her myrmidons. The lamp can't simply be left in the chamber, unfortunately, because there's no place {@creature the chained thing|KPSC} can't reach with its Slam attack to knock the lamp over and extinguish its light. Someone needs to face the creature and keep inflicting radiant damage, at least until the lich and her minions have been dealt with.": "辐射伤害是击败{@creature the chained thing|KPSC}的关键。如果角色没有可靠的辐射伤害来源，{@item ghoul light|KPSC}就是。它每轮只造成1点辐射伤害（{@creature the chained thing|KPSC}的易伤效果使伤害翻倍至2点），但它可以阻止{@creature the chained thing|KPSC}恢复生命并使其无法重生，也阻止{@creature Llagfel|KPSC}和她的侍从重生。不幸的是，灯笼不能简单地留在房间里，因为没有地方{@creature the chained thing|KPSC}无法用其猛击攻击到灯笼并熄灭其光芒。必须有人面对这个生物并持续造成辐射伤害，至少直到巫妖和她的手下被解决为止。",
	"The presence of {@creature the chained thing|KPSC} nearly atop the Black River is also what's keeping the portal to the Dry Lands open on Level 2 ({@area Area 214|SC-214|x}). When {@creature the chained thing|KPSC} is destroyed, the portal closes permanently. Undead on this side are trapped in Midgard and no more can come through. This won't make them happy, and if characters travel through Level 2 or Level 1 again, they should be ambushed one last time by the last, powerful remnants of those visitors from the Dry Lands.": "{@creature the chained thing|KPSC} 几乎在黑河上方的存在也是维持位于2级（{@area Area 214|SC-214|x}）的通往干旱之地的传送门敞开的原因。当{@creature the chained thing|KPSC}被摧毁时，传送门将永久关闭。这边的不死生物被困在中加尔德，不会再有更多的不死生物通过。这将不会让它们开心，如果角色再次穿越2级或1级，他们应该最后一次被干旱之地的访客的强大残余伏击。",
	"The presence of deep ones on the main Black River map should be a clue to characters that other chambers must exist along the river. Deep ones typically live near the coast, and the Scarlet Citadel is more than 200 miles from the nearest sea. Where did the deep ones come from?": "在主要的黑河地图上出现深渊生物应该是一个线索，表明河流沿岸可能存在其他洞穴。深渊生物通常生活在靠近海岸的地方，而绯红城堡距离最近的海洋超过200英里。深渊生物是从哪里来的呢？",
	"The answer is \"from downriver.\" That should be the characters' logical first choice, if they think about it for a few moments. It's impossible to find \"tracks\" in the river with {@skill Survival} ability checks, of course, so unless characters see the creatures swimming upriver to their hoard or escaping back downriver, logic may be their best guide—that or an {@spell augury} spell or comparable divination, or even a few words wrung or {@condition charmed} from a captive taken in {@area Area 509|SC-509|x} or {@area 510|SC-510|x}.": "答案是“从下游而来”。如果角色们稍微思考一下，这应该是他们的逻辑首选。当然，用{@skill Survival}能力检定无法在河里找到“足迹”，所以除非角色们看到生物们游泳上游到它们的藏身之处或逃回下游，逻辑可能是他们最好的指引——或者是某个{@spell augury}法术或类似占卜，甚至是从被俘虏中套出的几句话，这些俘虏可能是在{@area Area 509|SC-509|x}或{@area 510|SC-510|x}中被抓获的。",
	"The Black River extension describes an area sacred to the deep ones. They maintain a small camp there, but its focus is an ancient well that's become the abode of a {@creature shoggoth|ToB}. In a past so ancient it's barely younger than Midgard itself, refugees from the Void squirreled away their treasures in this remote cache as a safeguard against the impending end of the world as they knew it. Their world did end, and a surviving {@creature shoggoth|ToB} took refuge in the well. Eons passed before deep ones swimming up the Black River discovered the horror in the well and made a practice of performing sacrifices to it. In return, the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} began granting ancient gold and other treasures of the Void to reward its worshipers.": "黑河延伸描述了一个对深渊生物来说是神圣的地区。他们在那里维持着一个小营地，但其焦点是一个古老的井，已经成为{@creature shoggoth|ToB}的住所。在一个如此古老的过去，几乎比中加德本身还要年轻，虚空的难民们把他们的宝藏藏在这个偏远的储藏处，作为一种对他们所知世界即将终结的保障。他们的世界确实终结了，一个幸存的{@creature shoggoth|ToB}在井中避难。亿万年过去了，深渊生物游过黑河时发现了井中的恐怖，并开始实行向其献祭的习俗。作为回报，{@creature shoggoth|ToB}开始赐予古老的黄金和其他虚空的宝藏，以奖赏其信徒。",
	"The deep ones understand the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} isn't a god, but they also know it's incredibly ancient and powerful. They don't worship it as a sacred being. Their approach is more like hopeful veneration. Their expectation is that if they serve this immensely powerful creature loyally, at some point they might lure it from its well to destroy their enemies. In the meantime, they provide it with sacrifices and it repays them with gold and jewels from a forgotten past that it dredges up from the bottom of its pit.": "深渊生物了解{@creature shoggoth|ToB}并非神明，但他们也知道它极其古老而强大。他们并不将其奉为神圣存在。他们的态度更像是希望的崇敬。他们期待，如果他们忠诚地侍奉这个无比强大的生物，总有一天它会被引诱离开它的深坑，去摧毁他们的敌人。与此同时，他们会献祭给它，而它则以金子和宝石回报他们，这些来自它从深坑底部挖掘出的遗忘过去的财富。",
	"Unless noted otherwise, all sections of the Black River are in complete darkness unless characters bring a light source with them.": "除非另有说明，否则黑河的所有部分都处于完全黑暗中，除非角色们带着光源。",
	"The Black River extension map is in two sections so it can be cut in half and arranged four ways. In fact, when combined with the main Black River map sections, you actually have twenty different layouts to choose from. Experiment with the maps and choose a layout you like.": "黑河延伸地图分为两个部分，可以剪成两半，有四种不同的排列方式。事实上，当与主要的黑河地图部分结合时，您实际上有二十种不同的布局可供选择。尝试使用地图并选择您喜欢的布局。",
	"We recommend using layout 1, attached to the downriver side of the main map, but feel free to do something different if you prefer.": "我们建议使用布局1，附加在主地图的下游侧，但如果您喜欢，也可以做一些不同的事情。",
	"The expansion maps can connect directly to the main map or you can place any length of river, from a few hundred feet to several miles, between the main map and the extension. An important consideration in that decision is how persistent your players are about exploring. You want to test their endurance, but you don't want them to turn back before finding the new area.": "扩展地图可以直接连接到主地图，或者您可以在主地图和扩展地图之间放置任意长度的河流，从几百英尺到几英里不等。在做出这个决定时一个重要考虑因素是您的玩家对探索的坚持程度。您希望测试他们的耐力，但又不希望他们在找到新区域之前就返回。",
	"The best way for characters to travel on the Black River is with the boat, assuming it remains intact. {@creature The boatman|KPSC} will take them to the deep ones' lair, if they name that as a destination and pay the fare. If the boat was destroyed by the trap at {@area Area 508|SC-508|x} or by river creatures, characters must swim, fly, or come up with another river craft of their own. Barrels from Gellert's larder could be lashed together into a crude raft. Plenty of construction material can be salvaged from the dwarven barracks if characters are willing to backtrack and lug it all down. A raft could be built from giant fungus growing in {@area Area 414|SC-414|x}, but any attack from creatures in the water is likely to leave it in shreds.": "角色在黑河上旅行的最佳方式是乘船，假设船保持完好。{@creature The boatman|KPSC} 将把他们带到深渊生物的巢穴，如果他们将其命名为目的地并支付船费。如果船被{@area Area 508|SC-508|x}处的陷阱或河流生物摧毁，角色必须游泳、飞行或自己想办法制造另一艘河船。从盖勒特的食品储藏室中的桶可以被捆绑在一起制成简陋的筏子。如果角色愿意折返并把所有材料拖下来，可以从矮人兵营中回收大量建筑材料。一艘筏子可以从{@area Area 414|SC-414|x}中生长的巨型真菌中建造，但任何水中生物的袭击都可能使其支离破碎。",
	"One unique aspect of travel on the Black River is that it sometimes inexplicably changes its direction of flow. Remember that it's not a simple subterranean river; it's an alignment of river, ley line, and shadow road. The normal laws of reality can and often do operate here, but they don't always. Whether the current reverses direction while characters are on the river is up to you and your estimation of whether another complication is needed. This event should serve more as a spooky, atmospheric element than as a real obstacle. The current of the Black River is generally sluggish anyway.": "在黑河旅行的一个独特之处是它有时会莫名其妙地改变流向。请记住，这不是一个简单的地下河流；它是一条河流、地脉和影子之路的交汇点。现实法则通常会在这里起作用，但并非总是如此。角色在河上时，河流是否会改变流向取决于你，以及是否需要另一个复杂情节。这一事件应更多地起到诡异、氛围的作用，而不是真正的障碍。黑河的水流通常缓慢流动。",
	"The landing here is only a few inches above the water level. There's no ring or fixture here to which to tie the boat, but there are plenty of rocks and mushrooms large enough to secure a line. Unless the boat is tied up, attached to a heavy weight, or attended, it drifts away with the current.": "这里的着陆点仅比水面高出几英寸。这里没有环或固定装置可以系船，但有很多足够大的岩石和蘑菇可以固定绳索。除非船被系住、系在重物上，或有人看管，否则它会随着水流漂走。",
	"The cave has two levels. The floor of the lower cave is damp everywhere and spotted with puddles. The upper level is 8 feet above the lower level and is accessible by foot and hand grips carved into the stone face. Mushrooms grow on both levels.": "这个洞穴有两层。下层洞穴的地面到处潮湿，上面布满了水坑。上层比下层高8英尺，可以通过脚和手抓在石面上雕刻的凹槽到达。两层都长着蘑菇。",
	"This chilly, lightless cavern is dank and damp. It smells of rotting fish and decaying vegetation. The floor is mere inches above the level of the river and has standing puddles in many places.": "这个寒冷、黑暗的洞穴又潮湿又阴冷。散发着腐烂鱼和腐烂植物的气味。地板仅比河面高出几英寸，许多地方都有积水。",
	"A rock ledge runs across the middle of the cavern and looms 8 feet above the lower half. A crude stone ladder is carved into the ledge, its handholds and footholds dripping with river mud and unidentifiable slime.": "洞穴中间横跨着一块岩石台地，高出下半部分8英尺。一架粗糙的石梯雕刻在台地上，梯级上滴着河泥和难以辨认的粘液。",

	"Deep ones don't use boats to travel on the river. They swim from place to place and climb up onto land (if humanoid) or drag themselves from the water (if more fishlike).

	"At first glance, the fungi could include any variety of giant fungus, including {@creature shrieker|MM|shriekers} or {@creature violet fungus}. In fact, these fungi are generally harmless but highly unusual. They form a hivemind that's capable of rudimentary thought and telepathic communication. When characters first enter the chamber, they must make a {@dc 13} Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, nothing happens. On a success, the character senses the fungi's attempt to communicate and can respond.": "乍一看，这些真菌可能包括任何种类的巨型真菌，包括{@creature shrieker|MM|shriekers}或{@creature violet fungus}。事实上，这些真菌通常是无害的，但非常不寻常。它们形成了一个能够进行基本思考和心灵感应交流的群体意识。当角色们第一次进入这个房间时，他们必须进行一次{@dc 13}智力豁免检定。如果检定失败，什么都不会发生。如果检定成功，角色会感知到真菌试图进行交流，并可以做出回应。",
	"Throughout the exchange, bear in mind the fungi's thoughts are utterly alien, they have no concept of the world beyond their cavern, and they communicate much like children who've been badly {@condition frightened}. The points the fungi want to communicate include the following:": "在交流过程中，请记住菌类的思维是完全陌生的，它们对洞穴之外的世界毫无概念，并且它们的沟通方式很像被严重{@condition frightened}的孩子。菌类想要传达的要点包括以下内容：",
	"They are terrified of the evil beings that come from the moving water. Those beings leave many fish carcasses in the chamber to rot, which is good, but they also break down the fungus, tear it apart, and make other crazy things happen, which is bad. The fungi don't understand why the beings do this or even what it is they're doing, but they try not to think about it because it fills them with dread. They're certain the evil beings must be sick in their minds or they wouldn't behave so badly.": "他们对从流动水中出现的邪恶生物感到恐惧。这些生物会留下许多鱼尸体在洞穴里腐烂，这是好事，但它们也会分解真菌，撕裂它们，并引发其他疯狂的事情，这是坏事。真菌们不明白为什么这些生物会这样做，甚至不知道它们在做什么，但他们尽量不去想，因为这让他们充满恐惧。他们确信邪恶生物一定是心智有病，否则它们不会表现得如此糟糕。",
	"The fungi can tell the party are different from the evil beings and not quite as sick in their heads, which is good, but they also came from the water, which might be bad because mostly bad things come from the moving water.": "这些真菌可以分辨出冒险者与邪恶生物不同，并且他们的头脑并不那么扭曲，这是好事。但他们也是从水中出现的，这可能不太好，因为大多数坏事都来自流动的水。",
	"Sometimes the evil beings from the moving water bring other beings with them who are terrified, and their thoughts make the fungi afraid too. That's bad.": "有时，来自流动水域的邪恶生物会带来其他生物，这些生物感到恐惧，他们的想法也会让真菌感到害怕。这是不好的。",
	"Something even worse than the evil beings from the water lives nearby (the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} in {@area Area 524|SC-524|x}). The fungi have no idea what it is, and they don't want to know. Mostly it stays quiet, like the evil beings when they sleep. But sometimes it wakes up, and then it's always angry and causes a lot of hurting. The fungi hide their thinking when it's awake.": "附近住着比水中的邪恶生物更糟糕的东西（{@creature shoggoth|ToB}在{@area Area 524|SC-524|x}）。真菌们不知道它是什么，也不想知道。大部分时间它保持安静，就像邪恶生物睡觉时那样。但有时它会醒来，然后总是愤怒并造成很多伤害。真菌们在它醒来时隐藏他们的思维。",
	"More than anything else, the fungi fear violence. They want the evil beings from the water to go away and never come back, but they don't want fighting. It fills brains with hate and other awful thoughts.": "比起其他任何事情，蘑菇最害怕暴力。他们希望水中的邪恶生物离开，永远不要回来，但他们不想要战斗。战斗会充斥大脑充满仇恨和其他可怕的想法。",
	"If anyone asks, the fungi confirm there are bad things here right now on the upper level of the cave, and those things are planning how to kill the newcomers with crazy bad things.": "如果有人问起，真菌确认洞穴上层现在有不好的东西，那些东西正在计划如何用疯狂的坏事来杀害新来的人。",
	"The final point is true if the characters have a light source with them or if they make any noise in the lower portion of the chamber. If they declare they're being stealthy and they have no light sources, they can attempt a group {@dc 13} Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. If more than half the group succeeds, the deep ones don't notice their arrival and might be caught by surprise.": "如果角色们身上带有光源或者在房间下部发出任何声音，那么最后一点是正确的。如果他们宣称他们在潜行并且没有光源，他们可以尝试进行一个{@dc 13}个体的敏捷({@skill Stealth})检定。如果超过一半的角色成功通过检定，深渊生物就不会注意到他们的到来，可能会被他们的到来所惊讶。",

This fright affects ability checks and attack rolls as usual, and the {@condition frightened} creature's speed is 0 since the chamber is filled with fungi, making it impossible to move without getting closer to fungus. There's one exception to the movement restriction: if a creature's saving throw result is 8 or lower, it must immediately (before taking any other action) move toward the river by the shortest route and dive in to escape from the horrid screaming in its mind. A creature in the river makes its saving throw with advantage.": "{@spell ice storm}对下层室内的真菌造成了可怕的破坏，触发了它们的防御机制：一种感应性的痛苦和恐惧的心灵哀嚎，影响到室内的所有其他生物。每个生物在其回合开始时，必须进行成功的{@dc 15} 魅力豁免才能免疫{@condition frightened}，直到其下一个回合开始。这种恐惧会影响到能力检定和攻击骰，而且{@condition frightened}生物的速度为0，因为室内充满了真菌，使得移动而不靠近真菌是不可能的。有一个例外的移动限制：如果一个生物的豁免检定结果为8或更低，它必须立即（在采取任何其他行动之前）沿着最短的路径向河流移动，并潜入其中以逃离脑海中可怕的尖叫声。在河流中的生物以优势进行其豁免检定。",

Try to keep Renry alive until characters reach the dark pool ({@area Area 524|SC-524|x}), where Renry's grisly death can demonstrate the intensity of the danger for characters who are reluctant to back down from anything.

	"A creature that takes damage while in a bridge space with an edge that drops into the river must make a successful Constitution saving throw or fall 16 feet into the water. The DC equals the damage taken from the attack. A creature with proficiency in {@skill Acrobatics} can add its proficiency bonus to the saving throw (the bonus is cumulative for a creature that normally gets its proficiency bonus on Constitution saving throws; e.g., a barbarian with {@skill Acrobatics} proficiency would double their proficiency bonus for this Constitution saving throw).": "在桥梁空间中受到伤害的生物，如果边缘通往河流，必须进行一次成功的体质豁免才能避免掉入水中的16英尺深处。豁免 DC 值等于受到的攻击伤害。具备{@skill Acrobatics}熟练加值的生物可以将其熟练加值加到豁免 throw 中（对于通常在体质豁免中获得熟练加值的生物，此加值是累积的；例如，具有{@skill Acrobatics}熟练的野蛮人会在这次体质豁免中将其熟练加值加倍）。",
	"A creature that makes a melee attack while in a bridge space with an edge that drops into the river must make a successful {@dc 8} Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check or fall 16 feet into the water. Alternatively, a creature can choose to attack with disadvantage and its Dexterity check is considered an automatic success. A creature that can attack more than once makes only one Dexterity check per turn, after its first melee attack. If the creature chooses to avoid the Dexterity check by attacking with disadvantage, all its melee attacks that turn must be made at disadvantage.": "当一个生物在桥上的空间内进行近战攻击，而桥边缘悬垂至河中时，必须进行一次成功的{@dc 8}敏捷({@skill Acrobatics})检定，否则会摔入水中16英尺。或者，生物可以选择以劣势攻击，其敏捷检定被视为自动成功。一个可以进行多次攻击的生物每回合只需进行一次敏捷检定，第一次近战攻击后进行。如果生物选择通过劣势攻击来避免敏捷检定，那么该回合内所有的近战攻击都必须以劣势进行。",
	"This chamber is a shrine to Nethus, a fallen god of fish, sea monsters, chaos, and the deep ocean. The followers of {@deity Hecate|Greek|PHB} placed the deity Nethus in chains for a time, and his followers were mostly absorbed by the church of Seggotan. When Nethus was imprisoned and his power waned, human communities near the sea shifted their worship to Seggotan with little fuss or upheaval. Deep ones, however, are far older than humanity. Their memories are long and their strange traditions are rigid and unchanging.": "这个房间是一个供奉尼萨斯（Nethus）的神龛，他是一位已经倒下的鱼类、海怪、混沌和深海之神。{@deity Hecate|Greek|PHB}的信徒曾经一度将尼萨斯镣在锁链之中，他的信徒大部分被塞格坦（Seggotan）教会吸收。当尼萨斯被囚禁，他的力量减弱时，靠近海洋的人类社区毫不费力地将他们的崇拜转向了塞格坦，没有引起任何骚动或动荡。然而，深海生物远比人类古老。它们的记忆悠久，奇异的传统刚硬而不可改变。",
	"This small shrine was carved from the rock wall of the river cavern some 16 feet above the water. A statue stands on a low dais at the far end of the chamber. The artistic manner of the sculpting is so highly stylized that it's difficult to be certain of the subject, but it appears to be a scaled humanoid bearing a stick in one hand and an octopus or squid in the other. Rusted chains are wrapped around the statue; the chains are obviously real and not part of the stonework. In front of the statue sits a basket of woven seaweed that's filled with humanoid skulls.": "这座小神龛是从河洞的岩壁上雕刻而成的，离水面约16英尺高。在室内的远端，一个雕像矗立在一个低矮的台座上。雕塑的艺术风格非常高度程式化，以至于很难确定主题，但看起来是一个手持一根棍子、另一只手拿着章鱼或乌贼的有鳞人形生物。生锈的链条缠绕在雕像周围；这些链条显然是真实的，而不是石制品的一部分。在雕像前面放着一个装满人类头骨的编织海藻篮子。",
	"Anyone with proficiency in {@skill Religion} or {@skill History} recognizes the statue as a portrayal of Nethus. The statue likely predates the god's imprisonment, since the chains were obviously added. The \"stick\" was once the shaft of a trident, but the head is broken off. It can be found in the bottom of the skull-filled basket if the skulls are dumped onto the floor.": "任何精通{@skill Religion}或{@skill History}的人都会认出这座雕像是描绘着涅萨斯。这座雕像很可能早于这位神被囚禁，因为锁链显然是后来加上的。\"棍子\"曾经是三叉戟的柄，但头部已经断裂。如果将这些头骨倒在地板上，你可以在装满头骨的篮子底部找到它。",
	"A dwarf realizes the statue is carved from a type of stone that's found only on coral-ringed volcanic islands. No such stone should exist in this place; it must have been brought here from hundreds of miles away.": "一名矮人意识到这座雕像是用一种只在环绕珊瑚的火山岛屿上发现的石头雕刻而成的。这种石头不应该存在于这个地方；它一定是从数百英里外带到这里的。",
	"The statue is an {@creature idolic deity|ToB} (Tome of Beasts). It remains quiet and does nothing to raise suspicion until someone is about to damage it or attack it (having telepathy, the deity has a basic awareness of what everyone around it is thinking) or until deep ones counterattack across the bridge.": "这座雕像是一个{@creature idolic deity|ToB}(野兽之书)。它保持安静，不会引起怀疑，直到有人打算破坏它或攻击它(拥有心灵感应，这位神明基本上知道周围每个人在想什么)，或者直到深渊生物开始反击穿过桥梁。",
	"The tumult of fighting in the mushroom cave and the terrified squeals of the fungi draw attention from deep ones elsewhere along this stretch of river. A second force identical to the first group (one {@creature deep one|ToB} per character plus one {@creature deep one hybrid priest|ToB}) arrives while characters are inspecting the shrine. As before, the deep ones are equipped with blowguns and {@item sea serpent venom|KPSC}.": "在蘑菇洞穴中的激烈战斗和蘑菇的惊恐尖叫引起了河岸其他地方深渊生物的注意。当角色们在检查神龛时，第二支与第一支队伍相同的部队（每个角色一个{@creature deep one|ToB}加上一个{@creature deep one hybrid priest|ToB}）到达。和之前一样，深渊生物们装备着吹箭枪和{@item sea serpent venom|KPSC}。",
	"How this battle unfolds depends on how characters approached their investigation of the shrine. If the entire party entered the shrine, deep ones attack them with spells and blowguns from the ledge across the river and try to keep them bottled up in the shrine. If one or a few characters remained behind in the mushroom cave, the deep ones either try to sneak up on them or snipe at them with blowguns from the river. Deep ones using blowguns from the river have three-quarters cover (+5 to AC and Dexterity saving throws).": "这场战斗的进展取决于角色们对神龛调查的方式。如果整个队伍进入了神龛，深渊生物会从河对岸的悬崖上用法术和吹箭袭击他们，并试图将他们困在神龛里。如果有一两个角色留在蘑菇洞里，深渊生物要么试图悄悄接近他们，要么从河边用吹箭狙击他们。从河边使用吹箭的深渊生物有四分之三掩体（+5 AC和敏捷豁免）。",
	"This battle also triggers the telepathic defense mechanism of the fungi in {@area Area 518|SC-518|x} if fighting becomes general in that area or anyone casts an area-of-effect spell there.": "这场战斗还会触发{@area Area 518|SC-518|x}中真菌的心灵防御机制，如果在该区域发生了一般性的战斗，或者有人在那里施放了范围效果法术。",
	"These deep ones bring no valuables into the fight, but characters can recover the deep ones' weapons and {@dice 1d6} doses of {@item sea serpent venom|KPSC}.": "这些深渊生物在战斗中没有带来任何贵重物品，但角色可以回收深渊生物的武器和{@dice 1d6}剂量的{@item sea serpent venom|KPSC}。",
	"This spot is the final resting place of {@creature Solnis Ledniskol|KPSC} (see the appendix), a human woman who died in the river and transformed into a {@creature drowned maiden|ToB} (Tome of Beasts). Solnis haunts the stretch of river depicted on the maps, but she can move around the river freely and even climb out to walk around on land when it suits her.": "这个地方是{@creature Solnis Ledniskol|KPSC}(见附录)的最终安息之地，她是一名人类女性，在河中死去，变成了{@creature drowned maiden|ToB}(野兽之书)。索尔尼斯(Solnis)在地图上标出的河段上游荡，但她可以自由地在河里移动，甚至在适合的时候爬上岸来在陆地上四处走动。",
	"When characters draw near the bridge, whether they're on the river in a boat or crossing the bridge on foot, Solnis prepares to attack.": "当角色靠近桥时，无论他们是在船上穿过河流还是步行过桥，索尔尼斯准备发动攻击。",
	"If they're in a boat, she clutches at the gunwale and implores for help. The story she tells is largely true in outline: she was captured but escaped and has been evading the \"evil sea creatures\" while hoping for rescue. This story won't hold up for more than a few seconds, and she doesn't press her luck with it. All Solnis wants is a glimmer of hesitation from characters so she can launch the first attacks. That's exactly what she does unless players declare their characters attack without giving her a chance to say anything. Ask for initiative rolls from everyone and set Solnis's initiative one point ahead of the best of the players' results.": "如果他们在一艘小船上，她紧紧抓住舷梁，并恳求帮助。她讲述的故事在大纲上基本属实：她被捕获但逃脱了，并一直在躲避“邪恶的海洋生物”，同时希望得到救援。这个故事不会支撑超过几秒钟，她也不会冒险继续谎言。Solnis想要的只是让角色们稍稍犹豫，这样她就可以发动第一波攻击。这正是她所做的，除非玩家宣布他们的角色发动攻击，而不给她机会说话。向每个人要求先攻骰，并将Solnis的先攻设定为玩家结果中最好的先攻结果再加一点。",
	"If characters are on the bridge, Solnis simply reaches up with her hair to snag someone around the ankle and drag them into the water. She doesn't announce her presence in any other way before attacking. If characters are battling deep ones on the bridge, Solnis bides her time in the water, hoping someone falls in. Deep ones can't drown so she must kill them with her claws and her kisses. Characters, on the other hand, she prefers to drown by weakening them with kisses while holding them underwater with her hair.": "如果角色在桥上，(Solnis) 紧紧地用她的头发伸出去，钩住某人的脚踝，把他们拽进水里。在发动袭击之前，她不会以其他方式宣告自己的存在。如果角色在桥上与深渊生物作战，(Solnis) 会在水中等待时机，希望有人掉进水里。深渊生物不能淹死，所以她必须用她的爪子和吻来杀死它们。而对于角色，她更喜欢用吻削弱他们，同时用她的头发把他们压在水下淹死。",
	"The river is 12 feet deep in the passage near the bridge. That's more than deep enough for her to pull creatures to the bottom and be completely shielded against attacks from above the water. If she has any creature {@condition grappled} in her hair and she's under attack from the surface, Solnis simply dives down to avoid taking damage while focusing on killing her captive.": "在桥附近的通道中，河流有12英尺深。这对她来说已经足够深了，可以把生物拉到底部，并完全避免水面上方的攻击。如果她的头发中有任何生物{@condition grappled}，并且在水面上受到攻击，Solnis会简单地潜到水底，避免受伤，同时专注于杀死她的俘虏。",
	"Solnis doesn't fight to the death. When her hit points drop below 30, she seeks to escape from combat underwater unless she has a creature {@condition grappled} and it's near death.": "索尔尼斯(Solnis)并不打到死。当她的生命值下降到30以下时，她会试图逃离水下的战斗，除非她有一个生物{@condition grappled}并且它濒临死亡。",
	"Because the drowned maiden has been in this area for so long and her influence permeates it, it's treated as a monstrous lair. Saving throws against her {@spell disguise self} spells are made with disadvantage everywhere on her portion of the Black River map. Also, Solnis rejuvenates after being slain if her body is left in the Black River (see her description in the appendix). She can bedevil the characters as they're coming and going on the river, and she can even follow them surreptitiously as they return to the main maps to attack them while they rest; it's fairly simple for Solnis to snatch someone with her hair and drag them into the river, especially if they're dozing within 15 feet of the water.": "由于溺水少女在这个地区已经存在很长时间，她的影响力渗透其中，这里被视为一个怪物巢穴。在黑河地图上她所在的区域内，对抗她的{@spell disguise self}法术的豁免检定都会带有劣势。此外，如果索尔尼斯的尸体被留在黑河中，她会在被杀后恢复活力（请参阅附录中的描述）。她可以在角色们往来黑河时纠缠他们，甚至可以偷偷跟随他们返回主地图，在他们休息时袭击他们；索尔尼斯很容易用她的头发抓住某人并将其拖入河中，尤其是当他们在离水15英尺的地方打盹时。",
	"If you think your players are inclined to believe a story from a person in distress, Solnis may remain hidden until after they've explored the mushroom cave and the shrine ({@area Areas 518|SC-518|x}–{@area 520|SC-520|x}) and dealt with all the deep ones there. When characters return to {@area Area 518|SC-518|x}, they find Solnis waiting for them, soaking wet, shivering, and collapsed on the damp stone floor. Her story about having escaped from the deep ones and needing help might be more believable under these circumstances.": "如果你认为你的玩家倾向于相信一个处于困境中的人的故事，Solnis可能会一直隐藏，直到他们探索完蘑菇洞穴和神龛({@area Areas 518|SC-518|x} - {@area 520|SC-520|x})，并处理了所有那里的深渊生物。当角色们回到{@area Area 518|SC-518|x}时，他们发现Solnis在等待他们，浑身湿透，颤抖着，倒在潮湿的石板地板上。在这些情况下，她关于逃脱深渊生物并需要帮助的故事可能更容易被相信。",
	"A second alternative, again depending on your knowledge of your players, is that the deep ones finally captured Solnis only a few hours or days before the characters arrived. Eventually she'll be tossed to the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} in the dark pool, but when characters arrive, she's being tormented by vengeful deep ones in the shrine ({@area Area 520|SC-520|x}). This adds credibility to her story and makes it all the more shocking when, as characters are escorting her back across the bridge, she grapples someone with her hair and dives into the river.": "第二个选择，再次取决于你对玩家的了解，是深渊生物在角色到达之前仅仅几个小时或几天就俘虏了索尔尼斯。最终她将被扔到黑暗池塘中的{@creature shoggoth|ToB}，但当角色到达时，她正在{@area Area 520|SC-520|x}中被深渊生物折磨。这增加了她的故事可信度，当角色们护送她穿过桥时，她用头发抓住某人并跳入河中时，这一切变得更加令人震惊。",
	"If you use the first of these scenarios, Renry knows nothing about Solnis and has never seen her before. In the second of these scenarios, Renry probably heard Solnis being tormented in the shrine but knows nothing about where she came from or how long she's been a captive.": "如果使用第一个情景，Renry 对 Solnis 一无所知，之前也从未见过她。在第二个情景中，Renry 可能听到 Solnis 在神殿里受折磨，但对她的来历或被囚禁多久一无所知。",
	"The entrance to this chamber is about a foot above the level of the river. There's nothing here to which to tie the boat. Unless it's attached to a heavy weight or left attended, it drifts away with the current.": "这个房间的入口比河面高出大约一英尺。这里没有任何东西可以系船。除非船被系在重物上或者有人看管，否则它会随着水流漂走。",
	"This chamber is used by the deep ones to prepare themselves before entering the presence of the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} in the dark pool ({@area Area 524|SC-524|x}).": "这个房间是深渊生物在进入黑暗池({@area Area 524|SC-524|x})之前准备自己的地方，用来面对{@creature shoggoth|ToB}。",
	"Two sets of stone steps ascend to an oddly shaped chamber. The stonework here is ancient beyond imagining. The filigree and carving on the walls and ceiling, though worn down by eons of use and neglect, surpasses anything you've seen before in both intricacy and strangeness. Whatever race of creatures cut this room from the rock was not of this realm. The designs suggest otherworldly vistas and alien anatomies, but thankfully erosion and deterioration have rendered them indecipherable.": "两组石阶通往一个奇形怪状的房间。这里的石工已经古老到难以想象。墙壁和天花板上的花纹和雕刻虽然被无数年的使用和忽视磨损，但在复杂性和奇异性方面超过了你以前见过的任何东西。切割这个房间出岩石的生物种族并非来自这个领域。这些设计暗示着异世界的景观和外星生物的解剖结构，但幸运的是，侵蚀和破坏使它们变得难以辨认。",
	"The floor may have been beautiful once. Now it's a morass of river mud, fish bones, discarded rags of clothing, and smeared blood.": "地板曾经可能很美。现在却是一片河泥、鱼骨、被丢弃的衣物碎片和血迹混杂的泥潭。",
	"Unfamiliar, savage objects hang from pegs rudely hammered into cracks in the walls or lie on shelves cobbled together from shattered barrels and broken ship's furnishings. These items resemble vestments and sacred objects, but they're made from fish scales, shark bones, the shells of giant crustaceans, and what can only be human skin, often with recognizable facial features.": "陌生的、野蛮的物体挂在粗暴地钉在墙缝中的挂钩上，或者摆放在由破碎的桶和破损的船具拼凑而成的架子上。这些物品看起来像礼服和神圣物品，但它们是由鱼鳞、鲨鱼骨、巨大甲壳动物的壳和只能是人皮制成的，通常还带有可识别的面部特征。",
	"A few small baskets tossed haphazardly into corners appear to contain gold and silver jewelry, precious gems, and fantastic art objects.": "几只小篮子随意地扔进角落，里面装满了黄金和白银首饰、珍贵宝石和奇妙的艺术品。",
	"A door of bronze with coral and mother-of-pearl insets stands closed.": "一扇铜门上镶嵌着珊瑚和珍珠母贝，紧闭着。",
	"A dwarf with the Stonecunning trait can't identify the source of the stonework or estimate its age any more accurately than \"older than any civilization I've encountered.\" A character who has proficiency in {@skill History} can try to get more information from the carvings by making a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw. On a success, they find the carvings too disturbing to study in detail and they can't learn anything from them. On a failure, the character suspects this chamber may be the work of exiles from the Void in prehistory. Unless the character has been to the Void or visited the Plateau of Leng, this can only be a guess. The character is deeply but subtly affected by what they've seen. Until the character completes a long rest, they make saving throws with disadvantage and all weapon and spell attack rolls against the character are made with advantage.": "具有石工特性的矮人无法比“比我遇到的任何文明都要古老”更准确地识别石制品的来源或估计其年龄。拥有{@skill History}熟练加点的角色可以尝试通过进行{@dc 15}感知豁免检定来从雕刻中获取更多信息。若成功，他们会发现这些雕刻太过令人不安，无法从中学到任何信息。若失败，角色会怀疑这个房间可能是史前虚空流亡者的作品。除非角色曾去过虚空或访问过莱恩高原，否则这只能是一个猜测。角色会受到所见之物的深刻但微妙的影响。直到角色完成一次长休，他们进行豁免检定时都会带有劣势，并且所有针对角色的武器和法术攻击投掷都带有优势。",
	"The door to {@area Area 524|SC-524|x} is closed but not locked.": "{@area Area 524|SC-524|x}的门是关着的，但没有锁。",
	"The \"vestments\" present in the chamber aren't strictly magical but they do serve an important function. Creatures wearing them are better able to resist the shoggoth's Hideous Piping. They make their saving throws against the effect with advantage and, when they're confused by the piping, they add +3 to their {@dice d10} roll to determine what they can do on their turn.": "在房间里的\"法衣\"并非严格意义上的魔法物品，但它们确实起着重要作用。穿戴这些法衣的生物更能抵抗着章鱼人的可怕吹奏。他们在抵抗该效果时获得优势，并且当他们被吹奏弄糊涂时，在确定他们在回合中能做什么时，他们的{@dice d10}检定投掷值增加+3。",
	"Three baskets woven from seaweed contain random treasures dredged up by the {@creature shoggoth|ToB}. This consists of jewelry and small statues made from gold, silver, platinum, bone, and a bewildering variety of exotic gems. The statues all depict disturbing or blasphemous subjects; the jewelry was clearly not meant to be worn by humanoid creatures. All of it is covered by a tarlike yet slimy patina. No reputable art or antiquities dealer will have anything to do with these items. Finding a buyer could be an adventure in itself, involving dealings with the most unsavory, unpleasant merchants imaginable. To the \"right\" buyer, the items would be worth 30,000 gp total. A much easier (both physically and psychologically) course of action is to pry out the gems and melt the metal into ingots. Any merchant would pay 10,000 gp for the sanitized raw material.": "三个用海藻编织的篮子里装满了{@creature shoggoth|ToB}搜集到的随机宝藏。其中包括黄金、白银、铂金、骨头以及各种奇异宝石制成的珠宝和小雕像。这些雕像都描绘着令人不安或亵渎的主题；珠宝显然不是为人形生物设计的。所有物品都被一层类似柏油但又黏糊糊的涂层覆盖着。没有正派的艺术或古董交易商会与这些物品打交道。找到买家本身可能就是一次冒险，可能需要与最不道德、最令人讨厌的商人打交道。对于“合适”的买家，这些物品总价值为30,000金币。一个更容易（在身体和心理上）的做法是取出宝石，将金属熔成锭。任何商人都会为这些经过消毒的原材料支付10,000金币。",
	"This chamber is always garrisoned by three {@creature deep one|ToB|deep ones} equipped with blowguns and {@item sea serpent venom|KPSC} {@homebrew |(see appendix)}.

The floor around the well is an intricately patterned mosaic rendered illegible by smears of river silt, blood, tarlike goo, and the remains of fish and other creatures that have been smashed into paste. Dark, thick, oily liquid fills the well nearly to its lip. The substance shifts and gurgles in the well in a manner no liquid should. The stench of blood, meat, sweat, and bodily humors is overpowering.": "青铜门后的房间由一个位于地面平齐的中央装饰性井所主导。井周围的地板是一个由河泥、血液、柏油状粘液以及被捣碎成糊状的鱼类和其他生物遗骸弄得难以辨认的复杂图案马赛克。黑色、浓稠、油腻的液体几乎填满了井口。这种物质在井中移动和汩汩作响，这种液体不应该有的。血液、肉类、汗水和体液的恶臭令人无法忍受。",

	"No matter how much deep one finery from the antechamber characters drape on themselves, they can't trick these deep ones into believing they're anything but intruders. The sound of fighting and spellcasting farther along the river alerts the archimandrite to danger. Magical disguises might cause a second's hesitation, but that's it. The {@item potion of submission|KPSC} from {@area Area 518|SC-518|x} can allow one character to enter the chamber and scout it without arousing the deep ones' ire, but that doesn't suddenly make them forget the larger situation.": "无论这些侍者角色如何华丽地装扮自己，他们都无法愚弄这些深渊生物，让它们相信他们不过是闯入者。河流深处传来的战斗和施法声让总主教意识到危险。魔法伪装可能会让深渊生物停顿一秒钟，但仅此而已。{@area Area 518|SC-518|x}的{@item potion of submission|KPSC}可以让一个角色进入房间并进行侦察，而不引起深渊生物的愤怒，但这并不会让它们突然忘记更大的情况。",
	"The deep ones' ritual entreats the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} to appear. Without a live sacrifice to lure the {@creature shoggoth|ToB}, this ritual takes some time. When characters enter the chamber, the archimandrite realizes time has run out. On its first opportunity, the archimandrite uses its claws to rip open the midsection of the nearest deep one, splashing blood into the pool. The inky liquid boils and churns, and the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} (Tome of Beasts) joins the action on the following round. It makes Slam attacks against the wounded deep one. It can attack up to five times, which ought to guarantee the victim's death and absorption into the {@creature shoggoth|ToB}. Make sure characters see this happen! They've fought deep ones and should have a good idea what it takes to kill one.

Note \"bleeding\" isn't the same as \"not at maximum hit points.\" Attacks that cause poison, cold, or radiant damage (for example) probably don't cause bleeding.

In the same vein, splashing blood from one of the containers in the corners of the room onto an enemy might direct the shoggoth's attention to that creature. If a player thinks of that, reward their insight with Slam attacks against the blood-splashed creature.": "这种生物被鲜血吸引。任何在流血的东西都是它优先选择的目标。请注意，“流血”并不等同于“未达到最大生命值”。造成毒素、冰冷或辐射伤害（例如）的攻击可能不会造成流血。要注意所造成的伤害类型以及数量，并指导章鱼怪对那些受到重大穿刺、砍砍、酸性等伤害类型的生物进行攻击。同样地，从房间角落的容器中向敌人泼洒血液可能会吸引章鱼怪的注意力。如果玩家想到这一点，请用对流血生物的猛击攻击来奖励他们的洞察力。",
	"Players ought to realize the creature in the well is beyond all of their characters' capability and retreat as soon as possible. Whether the deep ones are alive or dead is of little consequence. They're a significant threat to the characters, but they're insignificant compared to the {@creature shoggoth|ToB}.": "玩家们应该意识到井底的生物超出了所有角色的能力范围，并尽快撤退。深渊生物是活着还是死了并不重要。它们对角色构成了重大威胁，但与{@creature shoggoth|ToB}相比微不足道。",
	"If characters refuse to retreat, you have a few options.": "如果角色拒绝撤退，你有几个选择。",
	"First, the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} doesn't care whom it kills and absorbs; it ingests deep ones as happily as humans, dwarves, or elves. This can buy the characters a round or two of indecision.": "首先，{@creature shoggoth|ToB} 不在乎它杀死和吸收的对象是谁；它愉快地吞食深渊生物，就像吞食人类、矮人或精灵一样。这可能让角色们犹豫一两轮。",
	"Second, this is the real reason why {@creature Renry Lofulthur|KPSC} is here. If seeing one or two deep ones instantly dissolved into protoplasmic goo doesn't ring the party's alarms, the {@creature shoggoth|ToB|shoggoth's} next target can be Renry. Do your best to kill and absorb Renry in one turn. This is more difficult for the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} because Renry is tougher than a deep one, but that can also be to your advantage; if you allowed a player to control Renry, they know how tough the NPC is and should realize what it means about how staggeringly dangerous the creature in the well is.": "其次，这就是{@creature Renry Lofulthur|KPSC}在这里的真正原因。如果看到一个或两个深渊生物瞬间溶解成原生质凝胶没有引起队伍的警惕，那么{@creature shoggoth|ToB|shoggoth's}接下来的目标可能会是Renry(伦瑞)。尽力在一个回合内杀死并吸收Renry(伦瑞)。对于{@creature shoggoth|ToB}来说，这更加困难，因为Renry(伦瑞)比深渊生物更强壮，但这也可能成为你的优势；如果允许玩家控制Renry(伦瑞)，他们会知道这个NPC有多强大，应该意识到这对井中生物的惊人危险意味着什么。",
	"Third, you can turn the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} against a character. Any character who draws the shoggoth's full attention is likely to die—and death by {@creature shoggoth|ToB} is likely to be permanent, with no possibility of being raised or reincarnated. Even so, focusing on one character is better than spreading out the shoggoth's attacks, because once a character is {@condition grappled}, only the very strongest have much chance to escape.": "第三，你可以将{@creature shoggoth|ToB}转向一个角色。任何吸引了章鱼怪的全部注意力的角色都很可能会死亡——而且通过{@creature shoggoth|ToB}死亡很可能是永久的，没有任何复活或转世的可能性。即便如此，专注于一个角色要比分散章鱼怪的攻击要好，因为一旦一个角色被{@condition grappled}，只有最强大的人才有逃脱的机会。",
	"Killing a character doesn't need to be traumatic. Some groups will hardly bat an eye, but to others it's a taboo. If you suspect the situation could reach this point, think about your players ahead of time. Do any players show signs of getting tired of their characters? Has anyone given hints that they'd rather be playing a different class or race? If so, then this is an opportunity, not a problem. Have a private conversation with that character before the game and offer to let them replace their current character with one they'd enjoy more in exchange for killing their character in a spectacular way. You don't need to give any details, and obviously you need the player to keep this secret until after their big death. Handled properly, this situation can be a win for everyone.": "杀死一个角色并不一定需要带来创伤。有些团队可能几乎不会有任何反应，但对于其他人来说，这是一个禁忌。如果你怀疑情况可能会达到这一点，提前考虑一下你的玩家。有没有玩家表现出对自己的角色感到厌倦的迹象？有没有人暗示他们更愿意扮演不同的职业或种族？如果是这样，那么这是一个机会，而不是问题。在游戏前与那个角色私下交谈，并提议让他们用一个更喜欢的角色替换他们当前的角色，以换取以壮观的方式杀死他们的角色。你不需要透露任何细节，显然你需要让玩家保密，直到他们的角色死后。妥善处理，这种情况对每个人都有好处。",
	"After all this, players have been given ample warning that fighting the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} is a hopeless proposition. Anyone who stays and fights should understand it means their death. If that's their choice, play it out.": "经过这一切，玩家已经充分被警告，与{@creature shoggoth|ToB}战斗是毫无希望的。任何留下来战斗的人都应该明白这意味着他们的死亡。如果这是他们的选择，那就继续进行。",
	"Even getting out of the chamber may not be easy if more than half the characters are unable to move because of the shoggoth's Hideous Piping. They aren't {@condition paralyzed}, however, so one character can move a confused character out of the room through a combination of urging and dragging. As long as characters are making an earnest effort to escape, let them get away. You can even hit them with Slam attacks from the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} as they go but overlook the grappling portion of the attack.": "即使超过一半的角色因为邪恶的吹奏者（Shoggoth's Hideous Piping）而无法移动，离开密室也可能并不容易。然而，他们并不是{@condition paralyzed}，所以一个角色可以通过劝说和拖拽的组合将一个困惑的角色带出房间。只要角色们在努力逃跑，就让他们逃走。当他们离开时，你甚至可以用{@creature shoggoth|ToB}的猛击攻击他们，但忽略攻击中的缠斗部分。",
	"When characters escape through the anteroom, it's time for the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} to heave itself out of its well and ooze through the doorway in pursuit. This is purely for drama and to urge the characters to keep moving fast. There's no time to loot the antechamber or investigate the observatory. Describe the great bronze door dissolving into the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} and the doorframe bursting as the monster forces its way into the anteroom, where the walls buckle and chunks of ceiling collapse from the strain of the creature's immense bulk and strength. If characters make it to the river and keep retreating, they're safe. The {@creature shoggoth|ToB} doesn't pursue them along the river, but the sounds of destruction and Hideous Piping can be heard until characters are well away.": "当角色逃离前厅时，是时候让{@creature shoggoth|ToB}从井中挣扎着通过门口追赶了。这纯粹是为了戏剧效果，督促角色们保持快速移动。没有时间搜刮前厅或调查天文台。描述巨大的青铜门溶解成{@creature shoggoth|ToB}，门框破裂，怪物强行闯入前厅，墙壁变形，天花板块因为怪物巨大的体积和力量而坍塌。如果角色们成功到达河边并继续撤退，他们就安全了。{@creature shoggoth|ToB}不会沿着河追赶他们，但是直到角色们远离，毁灭和可怕的吹奏声仍然可以听到。",
	"You can throw one last problem at the characters if you want, in the form of a squad of {@creature deep one|ToB|deep ones}, {@creature lesser scrag|CCodex|scrags}, {@creature gargoctopus|CCodex|gargoctopi}, or {@creature water leaper|ToB|water leapers} that responded to the archimandrite's call. A fitting conclusion to this escapade is to have this force severely damage the characters' boat so that any baskets or sacks of ancient treasure taken from the anteroom fall overboard and sink into the Black River. In that case, leave them one lumpish gold-and-platinum statue that they recognize after the fact as a representation of a {@creature shoggoth|ToB} with jeweled eyes and teeth.": "如果你愿意，你可以给角色们抛出最后一个问题，以一支{@creature deep one|ToB|deep ones}、{@creature lesser scrag|CCodex|scrags}、{@creature gargoctopus|CCodex|gargoctopi}或{@creature water leaper|ToB|water leapers}的小队的形式，他们响应了总主教的召唤。对这次逃脱的一个合适的结局是让这支部队严重损坏角色们的船只，导致从前厅带走的古代宝藏的篮子或袋子倒入河中沉没。在这种情况下，留给他们一尊笨重的金铂合金雕像，他们事后认出它是一尊{@creature shoggoth|ToB}的代表，眼睛和牙齿上镶嵌着宝石。",
	"Unless characters hunt down {@creature Brutwer|KPSC}, she can remain a threat on this level for a long time. She can ally with different types of river creatures and be a real thorn in the characters' sides if they try to use this level for shelter while exploring the much more hostile environments of the Howling Halls. Even alone, her Call the Blood ability can prevent the characters from resting on this level with little danger to herself.": "除非角色们追踪{@creature Brutwer|KPSC}，否则她可以在这个层级上保持很长一段时间的威胁。如果他们试图利用这个层级作为探索更加恶劣环境的嚎叫大厅的庇护所，她可以与不同类型的河流生物结盟，并成为角色们的真正眼中钉。即使独自一人，她的“召唤鲜血”能力也可以阻止角色们在这个层级上休息，而对她自己几乎没有危险。",
	"The {@creature shadow river lord|CCodex} is another threat. Any gratitude he feels for the party's help against {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} is likely to be short-lived. If {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} isn't destroyed, the situation is far worse. She isn't keen on fighting anything very far removed from {@creature the chained thing|KPSC}, but she might do it if the stakes are high enough.": "{@creature shadow river lord|CCodex} 是另一个威胁。他对于队伍对抗{@creature Llagfel|KPSC} 的帮助可能会短暂。如果{@creature Llagfel|KPSC} 没有被摧毁，情况会变得更糟。她不太愿意与离{@creature the chained thing|KPSC} 很远的任何东西战斗，但如果赌注足够高，她可能会这样做。",
	"Potentially the worst threat here, though, is the gate to the Plateau of Leng. {@creature Xymargshra|KPSC} has no friends, but it has enemies—and allies—that would capitalize on the creature's disappearance to try to seize its wealth. Horrors of every kind dwell on the Plateau of Leng, and they're sure to be lured by the potential for plunder in a place like the Scarlet Citadel and the surrounding countryside. Most of what comes from Leng should be aberrations with links to the Void and their corrupted, twisted humanoid servants. {@i Tome of Beasts} and {@i Creature Codex} both include many horrific aberrations suitable for use in these roles.": "然而，这里可能最严重的威胁是通往莱恩高原的门。{@creature Xymargshra|KPSC} 没有朋友，但却有敌人——以及会利用这只生物消失的盟友们，试图夺取它的财富。各种恐怖存在于莱恩高原，它们肯定会被像血色城堡及周边乡村这样的地方潜在的掠夺吸引。从莱恩而来的大部分生物应该是与虚空有联系的畸变生物及它们被腐化扭曲的人形仆从。{@i Tome of Beasts} 和 {@i Creature Codex} 都包括许多适合在这些角色中使用的可怕畸变生物。",
	"The lowest level of the Scarlet Citadel is the seat of its mystery and attraction to the creatures that gathered here. This is where the magical energy of intersecting ley lines and congruent shadow roads is at its strongest and where characters will encounter the strangest magical effects.": "血色城堡的最底层是吸引聚集在此的生物的神秘所在。这里是交汇的地脉和一致的阴影之路的魔法能量最强的地方，角色们将会遇到最奇特的魔法效果。",
	"Elemental maelstroms are the norm on this level, to the extent that characters probably can't stay here for long stretches. A short or long rest is possible only in one spot—the abandoned refuge (Area 611)—but even that won't be very comfortable without special gear the party is unlikely to have.": "在这个层面上，元素漩涡是常态，以至于角色们可能无法在这里长时间逗留。只有在一个地点才能进行短暂或长时间休息——被废弃的避难所（区域611），但即使如此，如果队伍没有特殊装备，那里也不会很舒适。",
	"The {@item sphere of annihilation} in {@area Area 614|SC-614|x} destroys everything, including the air touching it. This vacuum pulls air through the tunnels. If the air was allowed to build up unlimited momentum, it would eventually become a howling cyclone. Closed doors and narrow passages lessen the storm, but the wind is always substantial. At its weakest, it's strong enough to send light objects sailing through the air, not just skidding along the ground. At its strongest, it can approach the force of a hurricane.": "{@area Area 614|SC-614|x}中的{@item sphere of annihilation}摧毁一切，包括接触它的空气。这个真空通过隧道吸入空气。如果允许空气无限制地积累动量，最终会变成呼啸的旋风。关闭的门和狭窄的通道减轻了风暴，但风力始终很强大。在最弱的时候，它足以将轻物体送入空中，而不仅仅是在地面上滑行。在最强的时候，它可以接近飓风的力量。",
	"Because of the strong wind, ranged weapon attacks are made with disadvantage if the range is more than 10 feet.": "由于强风的影响，如果射程超过10英尺，则远程武器攻击将带有劣势。",
	"At the end of every combat (the whole fight, not every round), all characters who were involved in the fight must make a successful Constitution saving throw or gain one level of {@condition exhaustion}. Characters who took no damage during the fight make this saving throw with advantage. The DC for the saving throw varies from chamber to chamber and is noted in individual area descriptions.": "在每次战斗结束时（整场战斗，而不是每回合），所有参与战斗的角色必须进行一次成功的体质豁免检定，否则将获得一个等级的{@condition exhaustion}。在战斗中没有受到伤害的角色可以获得优势进行这次豁免检定。豁免检定的难度等级因房间而异，并在各自的区域描述中注明。",
	"The two doors on this level (in {@area Areas 604|SC-604|x} and {@area 607|SC-607|x}) have a big effect on conditions here. When characters first arrive, the door in {@area 604|SC-604|x} is open and the door in {@area 607|SC-607|x} is closed.": "这一层的两扇门（在{@area Areas 604|SC-604|x}和{@area 607|SC-607|x}）对这里的情况有很大影响。当角色们第一次到达时，{@area 604|SC-604|x}的门是打开的，{@area 607|SC-607|x}的门是关闭的。",
	"The doors are strong enough to resist the wind; they can't be broken by the wind alone. They're not, however, airtight. In fact, quite a bit of air leaks around them even when closed. Characters might try to seal the doors by packing the gaps around them with wax, tarred cloth, and similar material. These efforts work for a while, depending on your judgment, but all are bound to fail within an hour ({@dice 1d20 × 3} minutes, if you prefer a random effect).": "这些门足够坚固，能够抵抗风力；它们不会被风吹坏。然而，它们并不是密封的。事实上，即使关闭时，周围还是会有相当多的空气泄漏。角色们可以尝试用蜡、涂过沥青的布等材料填补门周围的缝隙来封闭门。根据你的判断，这些努力会在一段时间内有效，但都将在一个小时内失败（{@dice 1d20 × 3}分钟，如果你喜欢随机效果的话）。",
	"If characters manage to leave a path of open doors behind them clear to the Black River itself, the wind along that path rapidly builds up to hurricane strength. A creature along that path that's not an elemental must make a successful {@dc 20} Strength saving throw at the start of its turn or be pulled {@dice 2d6} spaces ({@dice 2d6 × 5} feet) toward the {@item sphere of annihilation}.": "如果角色成功离开一条通往黑河本身的开放门路径，沿着这条路径的风会迅速增强到飓风的强度。沿着这条路径的生物如果不是元素生物，在其回合开始时必须进行一次成功的{@dc 20}力量豁免才能抵抗被拉向{@item sphere of annihilation}的{@dice 2d6}个空间({@dice 2d6 × 5}英尺)。",
	"In {@area Areas 601|SC-601|x} through {@area 606|SC-606|x}, blowing sand and salt reduce visibility to 5 feet. Everything beyond that distance has total concealment unless characters have senses to supplement sight, such as {@sense tremorsense|MM}. Specific areas may include additional effects.": "在{@area Areas 601|SC-601|x}至{@area 606|SC-606|x}期间，风沙和盐粒使能见度降至5英尺。超出该距离的一切都将完全隐匿，除非角色具有能够补充视觉的感知能力，比如(暗视)。特定区域可能会有额外的影响。",
	"If the door in {@area 604|SC-604|x} is closed, the wind through {@area Areas 601|SC-601|x}–{@area 605|SC-605|x} drops to the level of a strong, normal wind and visibility increases to 30 feet. If the door in {@area Area 607|SC-607|x} is closed (as it is at the start), the wind through {@area Areas 608|SC-608|x}–{@area 614|SC-614|x} is a bit stronger than that because of the narrow apertures that are always open.": "如果{@area 604|SC-604|x}的门关闭了，从{@area Areas 601|SC-601|x}到{@area 605|SC-605|x}的风力会降至强风的水平，能见度增加到30英尺。如果{@area Area 607|SC-607|x}的门关闭了（就像一开始那样），从{@area Areas 608|SC-608|x}到{@area 614|SC-614|x}的风力会稍微强一些，因为那里的狭窄缝隙始终是开着的。",
	"Each area of Level 6 has a dominant element that affects damage dealt in those areas. The dominant elemental influence in each area is indicated by the background color on the map, and they are also summarized in the {@table Elemental Effects|KPSC} table.": "第6级的每个区域都有一个主导元素，影响该区域的伤害。地图上的背景颜色表示每个区域的主导元素影响，并且它们也在表格中{@table Elemental Effects|KPSC}中进行了总结。",

	"The multiple ley lines that pass through the region of the Scarlet Citadel all intersect here. Like the point where onrushing rivers flow into each other, the merging of magical currents causes tremendous turbulence.": "深红城堡地区穿过的多条魔力线都在这里交汇。就像奔流的河流汇聚的地方一样，魔力流动的交汇引起了巨大的湍流。",
	"This turbulence effectively turns the whole level into a zone of magical chaos. Every time a magical effect is invoked other than a simple bonus to hit or damage when attacking with a magic weapon, there's a 50/50 chance it triggers a collateral effect. Roll any die; on an odd result, a random effect occurs. Roll {@dice d100} and consult the {@table Chaos Magic Surge|DM07|Chaos Magic Surges table} from Deep Magic to see what happens.": "这种动荡有效地将整个层次变成了一个魔法混沌区。每当除了使用魔法武器攻击时的简单命中或伤害加成之外的魔法效果被激发时，有一半的几率会触发一个附带效果。掷任意骰子；在奇数结果时，会发生一个随机效果。掷{@dice d100}并参考《深层魔法》中的{@table Chaos Magic Surge|DM07|Chaos Magic Surges table}，看看会发生什么。",
	"If the magic is a spell that involves an attack roll or a spellcasting roll, you can use the {@dice d20} roll itself as the surge check rather than rolling a separate die. Always refer to the unmodified number on the die for the surge, not the modified result.": "如果魔法是涉及攻击骰或施法骰的法术，你可以使用{@dice d20}骰本身作为涌动检定，而不是额外投掷一个骰子。始终参考骰子上的未修改数字来确定涌动值，而不是修改后的结果。",
	"Note a surge can occur even if a spell misses its target or has no effect for some other reason. A surge is caused by magic being used, not by magic being effective.": "即使一个法术未命中目标或因其他原因没有效果，也可能发生魔力澎湃。澎湃是由于使用了魔法而引起的，而不是由于魔法有效而引起的。",
	"Collateral effects are triggered by casting a spell through both learned and innate spellcasting abilities, casting a spell from a scroll or magic item, using a spell-like class ability, or using a magic item to trigger a spell-like effect. Monster and class abilities that mimic spell effects don't trigger a surge unless the description of the ability specifically states it's a magic effect.

	"Cold damage and necrotic damage are amplified by the black ice. Every hit that causes cold or necrotic damage is treated as a critical hit, and saving throws against cold or necrotic damage are made with disadvantage.": "黑冰会放大冰冷伤害和死灵伤害。每次造成冰冷或死灵伤害的攻击都被视为暴击，而对抗冰冷或死灵伤害的豁免扑克将以劣势进行。",
	"Finally, the walls are lined with razor-sharp, black ice shards. These are easily avoided under normal conditions, but characters do a lot of dodging and weaving in combat. A creature that ends its turn adjacent to the wall must make a successful {@dc 10} Dexterity saving throw or take 3 ({@damage 1d6}) slashing damage plus 6 ({@damage 1d12}) necrotic damage (already amplified by the room's cold).": "最终，墙壁上布满了锋利的黑冰碎片。在正常情况下很容易避开，但角色在战斗中需要频繁躲闪。当生物结束回合时，如果位于墙壁相邻位置，必须进行成功的{@dc 10}敏捷豁免检定，否则会受到3（{@damage 1d6}）点割伤伤害和6（{@damage 1d12}）点死灵伤害（已经受到房间寒冷的影响）。",

The ice is translucent enough for the vague outline of the passageway to be seen beyond it.": "检查门后，角色们意识到这根本不是一扇门；它是一块厚达2英尺的冰块，横跨通道，有足够小的缝隙让风穿过。冰块足够透明，可以看到通道的模糊轮廓。",
	"The ice has AC 15 and 25 hit points, but it's magically immune to all damage unless {@spell dispel magic} is cast on it.

	"The bones gathered here over centuries because of the eddy effect. Hidden among them is a {@creature bonepowder ghoul|ToB} (Tome of Beasts) named {@creature Morgaryv|KPSC}.

	"Although {@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} is tremendously intelligent and speaks four languages, it wants only bones. There's little else the party could offer that would get it to converse or negotiate with them, with one exception. The ghoul is bound to this chamber; it can't leave because the wind would scatter its dust and pull it into the {@item sphere of annihilation}. If characters are willing to carry it up to the Black River or even back to {@area Area 607|SC-607|x} or {@area 612|SC-612|x}, it negotiates for that. In exchange, {@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} offers to spare their lives. To sweeten the deal, it mentions that among the bones in its chamber are many valuable items the characters would find useful, but several of them are certain to die if they try to take the chamber by force. Characters can see gold and gems beneath their feet, and {@spell detect magic} does reveal the presence of several magic items under the bones.": "尽管{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC}极其聪明，会说四种语言，但它只想要骨头。派对几乎没有其他东西可以提供，让它愿意与他们交谈或谈判，除了一个例外。这只食尸鬼被束缚在这个房间里；它无法离开，因为风会吹散它的尘土并将其拉入{@item sphere of annihilation}。如果角色们愿意把它带到黑河甚至带回{@area Area 607|SC-607|x}或{@area 612|SC-612|x}，它会进行谈判。作为交换，{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC}答应饶过他们的性命。为了使交易更有吸引力，它提到在它的房间里的骨头中有许多对角色们有用的宝贵物品，但如果他们试图强行夺取房间，其中几个人肯定会死。角色们可以看到他们脚下的金子和宝石，{@spell detect magic}也透露了骨头下有几件魔法物品的存在。",
	"{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} is well aware these arrangements are fraught with peril for itself. Don't lose sight of its 19 Intelligence. It is not easily duped. Its preferred plan is to Coalesce into a more solid form and walk in a huddle with the characters to a safer area. This requires that it absorb someone's life force via Gravedust, if it hasn't already. {@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} doesn't soft-pedal the risk to the characters, but only one of them needs to take necrotic damage.": "{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC}非常清楚这些安排对它本身充满危险。不要忽视它19的智力。它不容易被欺骗。它更倾向于融合成更坚实的形态，并与角色们一起走到一个更安全的区域。这需要它通过Gravedust吸收某人的生命力，如果它还没有这样做的话。{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC}不会淡化对角色们的风险，但只需要其中一个承受死灵伤害。",
	"Alternatively, there's an open-topped box in the chamber. Someone could carry {@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} in that. Under no circumstances will it get into anything that can be closed.": "另外，在房间里有一个开口的盒子。有人可以把{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC}放在里面。绝对不会让它进入任何可以关闭的东西。",
	"Furthermore, there's nothing wrong with its hearing. If players discuss ways to trick {@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} around the table, then their characters must be doing the same in the dungeon. {@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} doesn't let them leave the chamber and \"think it over;\" that's obviously a trap. The same thing goes for conversing in a language it doesn't understand. Unless the characters have telepathy or some other way to communicate silently and invisibly, whatever they say must be said in front of {@creature Morgaryv|KPSC}.": "此外，它的听觉也没有问题。如果玩家们在桌旁讨论如何欺骗{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC}，那么他们的角色必须在地牢里做同样的事情。{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC}不会让他们离开房间“考虑一下”；那显然是一个陷阱。同样，用它听不懂的语言交谈也是如此。除非角色有心灵感应或其他隐秘交流方式，否则他们说的任何话都必须在{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC}面前说出。",
	"If characters try dumping all the dust out of the box in the hope that the wind will scatter the ghoul, {@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} can just drift with the wind back to this chamber. The {@item sphere of annihilation} is the only thing on this level it fears.": "如果角色们试图把盒子里的所有灰尘倒出来，希望风会把食尸鬼吹散，{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} 可能会随风飘回这个房间。{@item sphere of annihilation} 是这一层唯一让它害怕的东西。",
	"Finally, even if everything is settled and seems above-board, {@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} is primed for a trick. It doesn't wait to be betrayed. It attacks at the first hint of betrayal: the first time someone draws a weapon, readies a spell component, makes a suspicious movement with their hand, utters an arcane syllable ({@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} is a potent spellcaster itself and knows the tricks), or even jokes about tossing it into the sphere. In game terms, {@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} has a prepared action to cut loose if anything seems amiss. None of this is a secret; the ghoul spells it out for characters from the beginning, to avoid misunderstandings. {@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} is evil, but it deals squarely with the characters as long as they behave. It wants its freedom.": "最后，即使一切都已经解决，看起来一切都很正常，{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} 也已经做好了应对诡计的准备。它不会等待被背叛。一旦有背叛的迹象：第一次有人拔出武器、准备咒语材料、用手做出可疑动作、念出奥术音节（{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} 本身就是一位强大的咒术师，了解各种诡计），甚至是开玩笑说要把它扔进球体里，它就会立即反击。在游戏术语中，{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} 已经准备好行动，一旦有任何异常情况。这一切都不是秘密；食尸鬼从一开始就向角色们明确说明，以避免误解。{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} 是邪恶的，但只要角色们表现良好，它会公平对待他们。它想要自由。",
	"If characters do help {@creature Morgaryv|KPSC} get free from this level, its gratitude doesn't transform it from a hate-filled, undead thing longing to consume all life. Eventually, their paths should cross again so characters can rectify their misdeed of setting a great evil loose in the world.": "如果角色们帮助{@creature Morgaryv|KPSC}从这个层面上解脱，它的感激之情并不能改变它仍然是一个充满仇恨的不死生物，渴望吞噬所有生命的事实。最终，他们的道路应该会再次交汇，这样角色们才能纠正他们释放了一股巨大邪恶到世界上的过失。",

	"The fire ring contains no ash. Instead, there's an {@item iron pot|PHB|iron cooking pot} holding some burned rags and a half-full {@item Oil (flask)|PHB|flask of oil} lying next to it. These are the remains of the previous party's ersatz oil stove; they burned oil-soaked rags in the pot and continually fed more oil to it. With fresh rags and more oil, it would work again.

It's unlikely the characters brought along a stack of firewood, {@item Clothing, cold weather|IDRotF|cold-weather gear}, or sufficient {@item blanket|PHB|blankets} unless this is a return trip or they have a well-stocked {@item bag of holding}.

	"However, while {@creature Hasfera-ruzai|KPSC} remains imprisoned in {@area Area 612|SC-612|x}, characters may be plagued with disturbing dreams when they try to take a long rest here. At the end of a long rest, each character must make a {@dc 13} spellcasting ability check. Arcane spellcasters make this check with advantage. Characters without a spellcasting ability make a simple Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check (using whichever is lowest), with disadvantage. If the check fails, the character gets the benefits of a long rest. If the check succeeds, the character gets only a short rest, not a long one. The more competent a spellcaster is, the more likely their thoughts are to be disturbed by {@creature Hasfera-ruzai|KPSC}.

Characters can tell the inside of the cylinder is aflame, but they can't make out any details beyond that through the cloudy ice.

That's why it refused to grant a {@spell wish} to a human, which led to it being imprisoned here and its slow transformation into an {@creature al-Aeshma genie|ToB} (Tome of Beasts). It desperately wants to be free from its prison, and it swallows some of its contempt if that allows it to negotiate for this prize. \"Bored out of its mind\" is an almost literal description of {@creature Hasfera-ruzai|KPSC}. Centuries of isolation have driven it nearly insane. The genie is easily frustrated by mortals, and it's prone to furious outbursts when things don't go its way. {@creature Hasfera-ruzai|KPSC} immediately calms down again after each outburst and tries to smooth things over, but conversation with it isn't easy.": "{@creature Hasfera-ruzai|KPSC} 是一个令人讨厌的生物，对人类及其同类充满蔑视。这就是为什么它拒绝向一个人类授予 {@spell wish}，导致它被囚禁在这里，并慢慢变成了一个 {@creature al-Aeshma genie|ToB}（野兽之书）。它渴望摆脱囚牢，如果这能让它谈判获得自由，它会忍受一些蔑视。\"无聊到发疯\"几乎是对 {@creature Hasfera-ruzai|KPSC} 的字面描述。数个世纪的孤立几乎让它疯狂。这个精灵很容易被凡人激怒，当事情不顺利时，它会爆发愤怒。每次发作后 {@creature Hasfera-ruzai|KPSC} 马上平静下来，努力化解冲突，但与它交谈并不容易。",
	"In negotiation, {@creature Hasfera-ruzai|KPSC} can make the following points. It doesn't outright lie to the characters, but it does omit important details and distorts the truth to an alarming degree if it believes doing so might improve its chances for freedom.": "在谈判中，{@creature Hasfera-ruzai|KPSC} 可以提出以下观点。它并不直接向角色撒谎，但会隐瞒重要细节，并且在认为这样做可能提高自己获得自由机会的情况下，会扭曲事实到令人震惊的程度。",

	"{@creature Hasfera-ruzai|KPSC} was brought here in chains and never saw any other portion of this dungeon, so it can't provide useful information of that sort. If characters have seen the {@item sphere of annihilation} and describe it, the genie recognizes immediately what it is, and its knowledge of such things is extensive. Hasferaruzai recognizes this as a bargaining chip. It offers tantalizing tidbits but won't reveal more until it's free.

Preferably, it should be a player whose character can't be very helpful in the battle or who is {@condition incapacitated} or killed early.": "{@creature Hasfera-ruzai|KPSC}（被囚禁在{@area Area 612|SC-612|x}中的阿埃什玛精灵）不受这个领域的风和闪电影响，这使它在这场战斗中成为一个了不起的盟友。假设角色们与这个精灵达成了协议，最好让一名玩家在这里控制它作为一个NPC。最好是一个在战斗中无法提供太多帮助的角色，或者是{@condition incapacitated}或者在早期被杀死的角色。",
	"When the voidling triggers a Necrotic Burst, a fragment of the sphere loops out through nearby space, annihilating whatever it plows through before returning to the sphere. This happens in a single turn; the fragment moves much faster than a {@item sphere of annihilation} normally moves.": "当虚空生物触发死灵爆发时，一个球体的碎片穿越附近的空间，摧毁它穿过的任何东西，然后返回到球体中。这一切发生在一个回合内；这个碎片移动得比一个{@item sphere of annihilation}通常移动得快。",

	"A character who occupies a space through which the fragment travels must make a successful {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw or take 22 ({@damage 4d10}) force damage. These bursts also create new passages through the walls of the dungeon. These passages aren't doorways—they're just 2-foot holes through the stone—but Small and Medium creatures can squeeze through them.": "当一个角色占据了碎片穿过的空间时，必须进行成功的{@dc 13}敏捷豁免才能避免受到22({@damage 4d10})力量伤害。这些爆炸也会在地牢墙壁上创建新的通道。这些通道不是门口—它们只是穿过石头的2英尺洞口—但小型和中型生物可以从中挤过去。",
	"The wind blowing through this level all converges into the {@item sphere of annihilation}. If a straight line can be drawn from any portion of the sphere to any portion of the space a character occupies, that character is in danger of being drawn toward the sphere.": "这一层吹过的风都会汇聚到{@item sphere of annihilation}。如果可以从球体的任何部分画一条直线到角色所在的空间的任何部分，那么这个角色就有被吸向球体的危险。",
	"To avoid being blown toward the sphere, a creature must make a successful {@dc 15} Strength saving throw at the end of its turn. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature is positioned partially around a corner from the sphere or if the creature is anchored to the rock (with rope and spikes, for example). If characters are tied together, they get advantage on their saving throws until an adjacent character fails; then their advantage flips to disadvantage. Be sure players understand this before characters rope themselves together!": "为了避免被吹向球体，生物必须在自己的回合结束时进行一次成功的{@dc 15}力量豁免才行。如果生物部分位于球体周围的角落，或者生物被用绳索和尖刺固定在岩石上，那么进行这次豁免检定时会获得优势。如果角色被绑在一起，他们在进行豁免检定时会获得优势，直到相邻的角色失败为止；然后他们的优势会变成劣势。在角色们把自己绑在一起之前，请确保玩家们理解这一点！",
	"If the saving throw succeeds, the creature holds its position. If the saving throw result is 10–14, the creature is pulled 10 feet closer to the sphere. If the result is 9 or lower, the creature becomes airborne, is pulled within 10 feet of the sphere, and is swirling around it clockwise. See Circling the Drain.": "如果豁免成功，生物保持原位。如果豁免结果为10-14，生物被拉近10英尺到球体。如果结果为9或更低，生物变得悬空，被拉到球体的10英尺内，并顺时针绕着它旋转。请参阅环绕漩涡(Circling the Drain)。",

	"Once a creature is lifted bodily into the maelstrom swirling around the {@item sphere of annihilation}, they're effectively flying out of control unless the creature has a flying speed of its own. The creature is treated as {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 18}) by the wind. At the start of the creature's turn, roll a {@dice d12} and read the result as a position on a clock face centered on the sphere; swirl the creature around the circle a few times, stopping at that number position within 10 feet of the sphere. The creature takes 14 ({@damage 4d6}) bludgeoning damage from banging against the walls, floor, and ceiling plus 22 ({@damage 4d10}) force damage from brushing against the sphere; a successful {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw halves the bludgeoning damage and negates the force damage. This DC is higher than the typical saving throw against a {@item sphere of annihilation} because the creature has so little control over its own movement.": "一旦生物被完全提起到围绕着{@item sphere of annihilation}旋转的漩涡中，除非该生物本身具有飞行速度，否则它们就会失去控制地飞行。风将生物视为{@condition grappled}（逃脱{@dc 18}）。在生物的回合开始时，投掷一个{@dice d12}，将结果视为钟面上以球体为中心的位置；将生物在圆圈周围旋转几次，最终停在距离球体10英尺的那个数字位置。生物因撞击墙壁、地板和天花板而受到14({@damage 4d6}) 钝击伤害，以及因与球体擦身而过而受到22({@damage 4d10})力量伤害；成功的{@dc 15} 敏捷豁免可减半钝击伤害并抵消力量伤害。这个豁免 DC 高于典型的对抗{@item sphere of annihilation}的豁免，因为生物对自己的移动几乎没有控制力。",
	"A creature that uses an action and makes a successful {@dc 18} Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to escape the {@action grapple} latches onto a projecting stone on the floor or wall and lands {@condition prone} in their space.": "一只生物使用一个动作并成功进行 {@dc 18} 力量 ({@skill Athletics}) 检定来摆脱 {@action grapple} 陷阱，紧紧抓住地板或墙壁上的突出石头，落到他们的空间中 {@condition prone}。",

	"When the {@creature voidling|ToB} is destroyed, the {@item sphere of annihilation} collapses into itself until it finally disappears into the Void with a pop and a burst of necrotic energy equivalent to the voidlings's Necrotic Burst. This burst doesn't launch a fragment of the sphere, since it's entirely gone.": "当{@creature voidling|ToB}被摧毁时，{@item sphere of annihilation}会坍塌直至最终消失在虚空中，伴随着一声啪的声响和一股等同于虚灵的死灵爆发的死灵能量。这股爆发不会发射出球体的碎片，因为它完全消失了。",
	"When the sphere collapses, the wind dies away completely. Creatures that were swirling around the sphere plow into the floor and take a final 3 ({@damage 1d6}) bludgeoning damage.": "当球体坍塌时，风完全停止。原本在球体周围旋转的生物撞向地面，受到最后 3 ({@damage 1d6}) 钝击伤害。",
	"Some past interpretations of the {@item sphere of annihilation} included the idea that things and people destroyed by it weren't simply gone; they were erased not only from existence but also from memory as if they'd never existed in the first place. Items created by a person, such as a painting or a home, still existed but no one knew where they came from. A beloved spouse had no memory of ever having loved or even known an annihilated hero; children had no recollection of a lost parent; other members of an adventuring party instantly forgot they ever had another companion the moment that person was annihilated by the sphere.": "一些过去对{@item sphere of annihilation}的解释包括认为被其摧毁的事物和人并不只是消失了；它们不仅从存在中被抹去，而且从记忆中也被抹去，就好像它们从未存在过一样。一个人创造的物品，比如一幅画或一座房屋，仍然存在，但没有人知道它们来自哪里。一个深爱的配偶不记得曾经爱过或甚至认识一个被湮灭的英雄；孩子们不记得失去的父母；冒险队的其他成员在那个人被球体湮灭的瞬间立刻忘记他们曾经有过另一个同伴。",
	"Treating the sphere this way is a challenge for players, who must roleplay not knowing something the players clearly do know (and probably feel sad about). It's an interesting twist you can add to the scenario if your group is up for it. It also requires a small alteration to the Player Handout, which mentions a party member lost to the sphere.": "以这种方式对待这个球体对玩家来说是一个挑战，他们必须扮演不知道某事的角色，而玩家显然知道这件事（并可能感到难过）。如果你的团队愿意尝试，这是一个可以添加到情节中的有趣转折。这还需要对玩家传单进行小的修改，提到一个被球体吞噬的队员。",

Fratricide isn't that shocking in the Nine Cities, but {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} was the unpopular one of the two siblings. His brother's allies would have killed him (or worse), so he departed for safer territory. In light of his fascination with ley lines, conjurations, and time manipulation, he couldn't have landed in a better spot than the ancient scriptorium of the elves beneath the Scarlet Citadel.

	"Add equal parts pure water, preferably glacial melt, and honey. The best honey is from the early spring, where crocuses are plentiful—any crocus variety will do for this—while other honey tends to produce successfully only half the time. Bring the mixture to a boil in an area devoid of natural light. Add an unbroken ampule of brazen saffron: the heat will eventually shatter the glass (or melt the wax), allowing the saffron to mix.
