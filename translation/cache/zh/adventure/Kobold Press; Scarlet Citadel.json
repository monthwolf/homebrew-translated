	"The alchemist's furnace is a device that transmutes one material into another. Every transformation brings the material infinitesimally closer to perfection.": "炼金术士的熔炉是一种将一种物质转化为另一种的装置。每次转化都让物质无限接近完美。",
	"The function of the furnace is not simply the manufacture of potions, acids, alchemist's fire, and other alchemical concoctions. Those mundane pursuits can be accomplished on any workbench. The furnace exists to aid the alchemist in nothing less than unlocking the mysteries of the material and spiritual universe.": "熔炉的功能不仅仅是制造药水、酸类、炼金术火和其他炼金混合物。这些平凡的追求可以在任何工作台上完成。熔炉的存在是为了帮助炼金术士揭开物质和精神宇宙的奥秘。",
	"The discipline of alchemy is built upon rigorous reasoning. A common misunderstanding is that alchemists are interested in turning lead into gold in order to make themselves rich. Everyone would like to be rich, but that's not what drives alchemists in their quest for gold. Their reasoning goes like this:": "炼金术的学科建立在严谨的推理基础之上。一个常见的误解是，炼金术士想要将铅变成黄金以致富。每个人都想变得富有，但这并不是驱使炼金术士追求黄金的动机。他们的推理如下：",
	"Lead is a base metal. Although it's useful, it's ugly and has little value. This is because lead is imperfect and impure.": "铅是一种碱金属。尽管它有用，但它很丑并且价值低。这是因为铅是不完美和不纯的。",
	"Gold is a noble metal. It's beautiful and has tremendous value. This is because gold is pure and nearly perfect.": "黄金是一种贵重金属。它美丽且价值巨大。这是因为黄金纯净且几乎完美。",
	"If lead could be cleansed of its impurities—if its imperfections could be made more perfect—its nature would also be perfected and it would become gold.": "如果铅可以被净化，如果它的瑕疵可以变得更完美，它的本质也将得到完善，它将变成黄金。",
	"Alchemy must be understood on those terms. It's not a search for wealth, it's a search for perfection. And it's not limited to metals. All things come in grades of perfection. Quartz is imperfect; a diamond nears perfection. A grape is imperfect; aged wine nears perfection. Knotty pine is imperfect; white oak nears perfection. What's true of minerals and plants can also be true of animals. A rat is imperfect; an Andalusian horse nears perfection. If it's true of lesser animals, it can also be true of people. If metal can be perfected, and the grape can be perfected, and the rat can be perfected, then why not a person? Perfection of the human spirit is the alchemist's true and ultimate goal. Learning to transmute (or purify) lead into gold is only the first step in that process. (And of course, the transformation must be permanent, not temporary as with the transmutation wizard's {@subclassFeature Minor Alchemy|Wizard|PHB|Transmutation|PHB|2|PHB} class feature.)": "炼金术必须根据这些条件来理解。这不是为了追求财富，而是为了追求完美。而且它不仅限于金属。所有事物都有不同程度的完美。石英是不完美的；钻石接近完美。葡萄是不完美的；陈年葡萄酒接近完美。多节松木是不完美的；白橡木接近完美。对矿物和植物成立的规律也适用于动物。老鼠是不完美的；安达卢西亚马接近完美。如果较低级别的动物适用，那么对人类也适用。如果金属可以被完善，葡萄可以被完善，老鼠可以被完善，那么为什么人类不可以呢？人类精神的完美是炼金术士真正和最终的目标。学会将铅转化为黄金（或净化）只是这一过程的第一步。（当然，转化必须是永久的，而不是像转化术士的{@subclassFeature Minor Alchemy|Wizard|PHB|Transmutation|PHB|2|PHB}职业特性那样是暂时的。）",
	"The alchemist's furnace aids that process. Heat and pressure perfect coal into diamonds, cold perfects water into ice, flame perfects wood into charcoal, sunlight and water perfect the acorn into the oak. The alchemist's furnace can replicate all these conditions and more for the alchemist who knows how to manipulate its controls.": "炼金术士的熔炉辅助这一过程。热量和压力将煤炭完美地转化为钻石，冷却将水完美地转化为冰，火焰将木材完美地转化为木炭，阳光和水将橡子完美地转化为橡树。炼金术士的熔炉可以为了懂得如何操控其控制装置的炼金术士复制所有这些条件以及更多。",
	"To use the alchemist's furnace, an item is placed inside along with appropriate catalysts, reagents, and purifying agents. The furnace is then sealed and the controls are adjusted to the desired settings. Once the activation lever is thrown, the furnace locks into its process and can't be stopped or altered until it's run its course. After {@dice 1d10} days, it unlocks and its contents can be removed.": "为了使用炼金术士的熔炉，在其中放入物品以及适当的催化剂、试剂和净化剂。然后密封熔炉，调整控制器至所需设置。一旦拉动激活杆，熔炉就会锁定并开始运行，直到完成过程后无法停止或更改。{@dice 1d10}天后，熔炉解锁，其中的物品可以取出。",
	"The controls on the furnace are tremendously varied and complex, with possible settings running into the hundreds of millions.": "炉子上的控制非常多样化和复杂，可能的设置数量高达数亿。",
	"For the desired transmutation to occur successfully, the alchemist overseeing the project must make a successful Intelligence check. The DC for the check depends on the desired effect. Sample DCs are listed on the Transformations table. If characters decide to experiment, the GM will probably need to make several judgment calls. The overseeing character's proficiency bonus can be added if the character is trained in the use of alchemy tools, and the number of previous attempts at this same transmutation can be added as a bonus on the roll.": "为了成功进行所需的转化，监督项目的炼金术士必须进行一次成功的智力检定。检定的难度取决于所需效果。样本难度等级列在变形表中。如果角色决定进行实验，GM可能需要做出几次判断。如果监督角色在使用炼金工具方面受过训练，他的熟练加值可以添加到检定中，而之前尝试过这种相同转化的次数可以作为奖励加到检定中。",
	"Additional bonuses on the Intelligence check can be gained by adding appropriate reagents and catalysts. Conversely, inappropriate reagents can impose penalties on the check. The appropriateness of any particular additive is up to the GM.": "通过添加适当的试剂和催化剂，可以获得智力检定的额外奖励。相反，不恰当的试剂可能会对检定造成惩罚。任何特定添加剂的适用性由（GM）决定。",
	"The result of a failed check usually is nothing more severe than wasted components and a mess that needs to be cleaned up. If the overseer's Intelligence check result is a natural 1, something went seriously wrong. The furnace might release toxic gas when it opens, it might create an angry quasit or manes instead of the desired item, or it might explode and blow everyone into atoms.": "失败的检定通常只会导致浪费材料和需要清理的混乱。如果监督者的智力检定结果是自然1，那么情况就严重了。当熔炉打开时可能会释放有毒气体，也可能会制造一个愤怒的小恶魔或曼斯，而不是期望的物品，或者可能会爆炸，把所有人炸成原子。",
	"The severity of the mishap should increase directly with the DC of the transformation being attempted.": "事故的严重程度应该与尝试的转化DC直接相关。",
	"It's also possible for a mishap to produce a serendipitous result. If the Intelligence check result is one lower than the DC or is a natural 20 but still a failure, the furnace produces something different from the desired item but still useful or interesting. This might be a powerful potion, a valuable substance, or a rare catalyst that can be included in the next attempt to gain a bonus on the check.": "即使出现意外，也有可能产生意外的结果。如果情报检定结果比DC低一点，或者是自然20但仍然失败，那么熔炉会产生与期望物品不同但仍然有用或有趣的东西。这可能是一瓶强力药水、一种有价值的物质，或者一种稀有催化剂，可以在下一次尝试中加入以获得检定奖励。",

	"The fish-cylinder is hollow, as anyone who taps on it quickly discovers. It has no apparent means of opening such as a screwed-in plug or a clamped‑down hatch. A few minutes of close examination and a successful {@dc 13} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check reveals a narrow, mud-clogged slot along the fish's belly. This slot is just wide enough for a knife edge to grip, and that's what's required; if a knife is dragged along the slot as if cutting the fish open, the cylinder splits apart into left and right halves that are joined by a concealed dorsal hinge.": "这个鱼形圆柱体是空心的，任何快速敲击它的人都会发现。它没有明显的打开方式，比如螺纹塞或夹紧的舱口。仔细观察几分钟并成功通过一次{@dc 13}智力检定({@skill Investigation})，会发现鱼腹部有一个狭窄、被泥巴堵塞的槽。这个槽只够宽以供刀刃握住，而这正是所需的；如果像切开鱼一样沿着槽拖动刀刃，圆柱体就会分裂成左右两半，它们由一个隐藏的背脊铰链连接在一起。",

	"Ooze plasma is the distilled essence of a {@creature gelatinous cube}, {@creature black pudding}, or other ooze creature. Visually, it resembles both a thick liquid and a gas. It's heavier than air so it can be held in open-topped bowls or tanks, and an object dipped gently into it comes out coated in ooze plasma. If a hand, wand, or other object is waved slowly through ooze plasma, the substance reacts and feels much like a thick liquid. It can be piped through tubes and drained through a spigot into a lower container, or even siphoned like water. If an object is waved quickly through ooze plasma, however, or if it's pressurized and squeezed through a nozzle, it behaves like a gas; the plasma flows around objects with no resistance, it floats upward and outward as if it's weightless before slowly settling back toward the ground. If sufficiently agitated, ooze plasma can even appear to dissipate or evaporate into the air, but this is an optical illusion; the plasma has only become so thin that it can't be seen. Eventually it settles downward and resembles a liquid again.": "软泥浆是{@creature gelatinous cube}、{@creature black pudding}或其他软泥怪物的精华。在视觉上，它既像浓稠的液体又像气体。它比空气重，因此可以放在敞口的碗或罐中，轻轻地将物体浸入其中，物体就会被软泥浆包裹。如果用手、魔杖或其他物体缓慢地在软泥浆中挥动，物质会产生反应，感觉就像浓稠的液体。它可以通过管道输送，并通过龙头排入下面的容器，甚至可以像水一样虹吸。然而，如果快速地挥动物体穿过软泥浆，或者通过喷嘴加压并挤压，它就会表现得像气体；软泥浆会在物体周围无阻力地流动，它会像无重力一样向上漂浮和向外流动，然后慢慢地回落到地面。如果软泥浆受到足够的搅动，甚至会看起来消散或蒸发到空气中，但这只是一种视觉幻觉；软泥浆只是变得如此稀薄，以至于看不见。最终，它会沉向下方，再次变成液体的样子。",
	"Ooze plasma is acidic. A creature that starts its turn in ooze plasma takes acid damage; the amount depends on how deeply the creature is submerged.

	"Upon drinking this potion, a creature is filled with feelings of inferiority and worthlessness. It has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and its speed is halved. Beneficially, however, other creatures pay no attention to it. They're aware of it—they see and hear the submissive creature normally—but they consider it to be no threat whatsoever and not worth paying attention to. Enemies that would normally attack the creature on sight don't lift a finger against it or even raise an eyebrow over its presence, in much the same way that powerful figures ignore lowly servants and attendants. The effect lasts 10 minutes or until the submissive creature makes an attack, is noticed taking something that doesn't belong to it, speaks to someone, or otherwise causes harm or steps out of line. Using a potion of submission guarantees that a creature can gain a surprise round in combat, but its first attack will be made with disadvantage (which may be canceled out if circumstances also grant it advantage).": "饮用此药水后，生物会充满自卑和无价值感。它在攻击检定和能力检定上有劣势，并且速度减半。然而，其他生物并不会关注它。他们意识到它——他们正常地看到和听到顺从的生物——但他们认为它根本不构成威胁，不值得关注。通常会对该生物发动攻击的敌人不会对其抬手攻击，甚至对其出现也不会抬眉，就像有权势的人忽视卑微的仆人和侍从一样。效果持续10分钟，或者直到顺从的生物发动攻击、被注意到拿走不属于它的东西、与某人交谈，或者以其他方式造成伤害或越线。使用顺从药水可以确保生物在战斗中获得意外回合，但它的第一次攻击将带有劣势（如果情况也给予它优势，则可能抵消）。",
	"The amethyst brooch is significant on deeper levels of the citadel, where it indicates its wearer is a person of importance to {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} and shouldn't be murdered without good reason. It is not, however, a guarantee of safe passage under all circumstances. Creatures on the lower levels understand symbols can be stolen and used by their enemies, and allowing the wrong person through just because they had a brooch is worse than not allowing the right person through because they didn't. For example, trollkin in the dwarven barracks (Level 3) won't defer to a character just because they have the brooch. It must be brandished as a sign of authority, and the wearer must behave as if they understand its significance. Otherwise, the trollkin assume the characters are murderers and thieves who should be dealt with as harshly as possible. The most likely way for characters to figure this out is by seeing leaders on lower levels wearing similar brooches.": "紫水晶胸针在城堡更深层次上具有重要意义，它表明佩戴者对{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}来说是一个重要人物，不应该没有充分理由就被谋杀。然而，在所有情况下，它并不是安全通行的保证。更低层次的生物明白符号可以被敌人窃取并利用，因此仅仅因为某人有了胸针就放行错误的人比因为没有胸针而不放行正确的人更糟糕。例如，在矮人兵营（第3层）的巨魔族不会仅仅因为某人有了胸针就对其恭顺。必须挥舞胸针作为权威的标志，并且佩戴者必须表现出他们理解其重要性。否则，巨魔族会认为这些角色是谋杀犯和小偷，应该尽可能严厉地对待。角色最有可能弄清楚这一点的方法是看到更低层次的领导者也佩戴类似的胸针。",

It doesn't follow a program; it responds to requests and built-in prerogatives in the best manner it can, according to its knowledge and understanding. In this case, it's simply not capable of fulfilling the purpose for which it was built (overcoming the elves' magic and shifting the entire arcane scriptorium to the present time), but it keeps trying. The way it tries is by following different temporal pathways from the present to 100,000 years in the future and back to the present again.

	"The construct has a limited supply of energy. Every so often, it must stop to recharge its energy matrices by siphoning vitality from the time continuum itself. Typically, this occurs after every {@dice 1d4} shifts to a different era. Each time the construct triggers its defensive field counts as one shift. It usually pauses to recharge while it has enough energy remaining for one shift, because shifting into an unknown time period with no reserve energy is a huge risk. Recharging takes {@dice 1d3} days.": "这个构造体有限的能量供应。每隔一段时间，它必须停下来通过从时间连续体中汲取活力来重新充能它的能量矩阵。通常，这发生在每隔 {@dice 1d4} 次转移到不同时代之后。每次构造体触发其防御场都算作一次转移。它通常会在剩余能量足够支持一次转移时暂停充能，因为在没有储备能量的情况下转移到未知的时间段是一个巨大的风险。充能需要 {@dice 1d3} 天。",

He now deserves to be called gruesome, but the irony is that no one aside from {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC|Imortra} has ever seen him this way.": "当地人戏称他为“可怕者”。因为没有人见过他，于是便传出了各种故事，说他长得面目可怖。有人说他的伤疤是由于一次魔法实验失败，也有人说他在出生后的几分钟内被父亲扔进黑河中。事实上，盖勒特年轻时可能是个英俊的人。数十年来在附近地脉强烈的魔法波动下生活在地下，导致他皮肤苍白无力，眼睛呆滞，皮肤上的病变永远不愈。现在他确实配得上“可怕者”的称号，但讽刺的是，除了{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC|Imortra}，没有人见过他这样。",

	"{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC} is an elf wizard who's fanatically devoted to {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}. She heard tales about the unique magical properties of the Scarlet Citadel region from elves who saw those properties firsthand centuries ago, before the Holzanger family laid any claim over the area. Those tales drew Imortra to the citadel to study, and {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC|Gellert} was already there.

	"Imortra's name originated during the years of her early adulthood, when her research and experiments in conjuring elementals and devils resulted in repeated tragedies.

When her conjurations resulted in innocent deaths, Imortra was banned from the elven community for two centuries.": "伊莫特拉(Imortra)的名字起源于她年轻时期的研究和实验，当时她召唤元素和恶魔的尝试导致了一系列悲剧。她所属的精灵社区传统认为这些行为属于“黑暗艺术”，谴责她触及了她无法理解和控制的邪恶力量。当她的召唤导致无辜者死亡时，伊莫特拉被精灵社区放逐了两个世纪。",

Like most dust goblins who rise to positions of leadership in their tribe, Keluikinj's mind is twisted and grim. He's no more sadistic than most dust goblins, but he has a fascination with the Void—or at least with the idea of the Void, as his understanding of the Void's nature is only a caricature of reality. Based on what he's seen inside the citadel, Keluikinj believes {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} and {@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC} have a connection to the Void that he'd like to exploit. They don't, but that belief is what's stopped the dust goblins so far from finishing what they came here for, which is murder and looting.

	"{@i The Scarlet Citadel} is a relatively straightforward adventure for players and the GM, but levels of the complex are connected both by key story elements and stairs. You'll also need to understand the relationships between inhabitants to get the most from this material.": "{@i The Scarlet Citadel} 是一个相对简单的冒险，适合玩家和主持人，但是复杂的层级之间通过关键故事元素和楼梯连接在一起。您还需要了解居民之间的关系，才能充分利用这些材料。",
	"The unifying villain of the Scarlet Citadel is {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, last (or nearly last) scion of the noble family of Holzanger, who built the citadel and once ruled the surrounding territory. Gellert dwells deep in the catacombs, where he can conduct his research on Void magic and the manipulation of ley energy in perfect seclusion. He's not, however, entirely cut off from the world. Powerful figures on other levels of the dungeon serve as his lieutenants in the underworld and as his liaisons to the surface world. Everything living beneath the Scarlet Citadel fears Gellert's power to one extent or another, though few have ever met the legendary sorcerer face-to-face.": "血色城堡的统一反派是{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}，霍尔赞格贵族家族的最后一位（或几乎是最后一位）后裔，他建造了城堡，曾统治周围的领土。盖勒特深居地下墓穴，可以在完美的隐居中进行有关虚空魔法和操纵地脉能量的研究。然而，他并非完全与世隔绝。地下城的其他层级上有强大的人物担任他的地底世界中的副手，并作为他与地表世界的联络人。血色城堡下的所有生物都害怕盖勒特的力量，尽管很少有人真正见过这位传奇巫师的真面目。",
	"Much of the original aboveground structure still stands, although it's not usable as a fortress in its present condition. Over the decades it has been used as a hideout by bandits and as a base of operations for adventurers exploring the area. Currently, it's been taken over by harpies that live in the basement of the main keep. They drive away most would-be heroes and sometimes terrorize nearby farms and logging camps. The harpies also throw their scraps to the owlbears that prowl the territory. The occasional presence of those predators contributes to keeping the crumbling fort free of curious interlopers.": "原始的地面以上结构仍然屹立不倒，尽管在目前的状态下无法用作堡垒。几十年来，它一直被强盗用作藏身之处，并成为探索该地区的冒险家的行动基地。目前，它已经被占领，由生活在主要城堡地下室的鹰身女妖(`harpies`)接管。它们驱赶了大多数想要成为英雄的人，有时还恐吓附近的农场和伐木营地。鹰身女妖还把剩饭扔给在领地里徘徊的猫头鹰熊(`owlbears`)。这些捕食者偶尔出现有助于使这座摇摇欲坠的堡垒远离好奇的闯入者。",
	"The entrances characters are most likely to find lead to underground passages and chambers that served as the castle dungeon when the Scarlet Citadel was still occupied by the Holzanger family and by the bandits who used it afterward. Unsurprisingly, in a world where rocs and dragons are real security concerns, the underground portion of the fortress was more extensive than the aboveground works. The current chief occupants of this level are a psychotic, sadistic torturer and serial killer known locally as {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}, along with a handful of equally twisted creatures that serve him. {@creature The Gaoler|KPSC} has no connection with {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, who tolerates his presence as a deterrent to explorers.": "在斯卡雷特城堡（Scarlet Citadel）仍由霍尔赞格家族（Holzanger family）和之后使用它的强盗占领时，角色最有可能发现的入口通往地下通道和室内，这些地方曾作为城堡地牢。在一个存在巨鹏和龙等真实安全威胁的世界里，堡垒的地下部分比地上建筑更加广阔。这一层的现任主要居住者是当地人称为{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}的精神病患者、虐待狂和连环杀手，以及一些同样扭曲的生物，它们为他效劳。{@creature The Gaoler|KPSC}与{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}没有关联，后者容忍他的存在是为了吓阻探险者。",
	"Beyond {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}'s chambers are ancient crypts of the Holzanger family. This section is rife with undead, thanks to a weak spot in the dimensional barrier between Midgard and the Dry Lands. That realm's corruption seeped into the crypts for centuries and worked its foul magic on the remains interred here. Even {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} avoids the crypts and guards against incursions from wandering undead.": "在{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}的房间之外是Holzanger家族的古老地下墓穴。这一区域充斥着不死生物，这要归功于中加德和干旱之地之间维度屏障的薄弱点。那个领域的腐化已经渗透到这些地下墓穴中数个世纪，并对这里安葬的遗骸施加了邪恶的魔法。即使{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}也避开这些地下墓穴，并防范来自游荡不死生物的侵袭。",
	"This level of the dungeon houses the arcane scriptorium and the mystical alchemy furnace. {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}, {@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC}, and their servants reside here, as do a group of covert dust goblins.": "这层地牢里有奥术书房和神秘炼金熔炉。{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}，{@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC}和他们的仆人居住在这里，还有一群秘密的尘土哥布林。",
	"{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} is a gnome wizard who hopes to unlock the secrets hidden in the forgotten scriptorium. The monographs buried here date back to the earliest years of the Holzanger residency and even to the time of the elves who predated them. In his quest to restore the heavily damaged manuscripts, {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} has become a master of time-manipulating magic. He is also a loyal vassal and apprentice of {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, since {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}'s arcane interests overlap Gellert's areas of study. When Gellert needs to be represented on the surface, {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} is the person he's most likely to send as his agent.": "{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}是一名侏儒巫师，希望解开被遗忘的书房中隐藏的秘密。这里埋藏的专著可以追溯到Holzanger驻地最早的年代，甚至可以追溯到比他们更早的精灵时代。在修复严重损坏的手稿的过程中，{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}已经成为了一名擅长操控时间的魔法大师。他也是{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}的忠诚臣民和学徒，因为{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}的奥术兴趣与Gellert的研究领域重叠。当Gellert需要在地表上代表时，{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}是他最可能派遣作为代理人的人选。",
	"The alchemist {@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC} is a human from the Magdar Kingdoms. Maksilov specializes in the study of slimes and oozes. She's managed to assemble an impressive laboratory for her studies, which also involve propagating novel species of her favorite creatures with unique properties.": "炼金术士{@creature Danaska Maksilov|KPSC}是来自马格达王国的人类。马克西洛夫专门研究史莱姆和软泥怪。她成功地建立了一个令人印象深刻的实验室用于她的研究，这些研究还涉及培育具有独特特性的新物种。",
	"Finally, a scavenging band of dust goblins has crept into this level, unbeknown to {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} and Maksilov. They're discreetly exploring, mapping the level's layout, and spying on its inhabitants with admirable caution while they size up the prospects for plunder.": "最终，一群尘土哥布林的搜寻队悄无声息地潜入了这个层面，{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}和Maksilov毫不知情。他们小心翼翼地探索，绘制着层面的布局图，并且以令人钦佩的谨慎观察着居民，同时评估着掠夺的前景。",
	"This level was carved out by a band of dwarven mercenaries from Melana who joined forces with Gerhardt III 150 years ago. All one hundred dwarves of the warband (which included not only soldiers of fortune but also owlbear trainers and a few skilled ring mages) resided in these spacious barracks styled after the great subterranean halls of their homeland.": "这个层级是由150年前与格哈特三世联手的来自梅拉纳的一支矮人雇佣兵团队开凿而成的。这支战队的一百名矮人（不仅包括了军事雇佣兵，还有猫头鹰熊训练师和一些熟练的戒指法师）都住在这些宽敞的兵营里，这些兵营的风格仿照了他们祖国的巨大地下大厅。",
	"When the aboveground portion of the Scarlet Citadel was overthrown and sacked by the knights of Khors 110 years ago, the dwarves stayed on, secure in their underground fortress with their ring magic and specially bred dire owlbears—or so they believed. But trollkin knew about the barracks. A few had even been hired as heavy laborers during construction, and that proved a fatal mistake for the dwarves. After a protracted siege to weaken the dwarves, the trollkin assaulted the fortifications with fierce determination. Gate by gate, room by room, barricade by barricade, the trollkin battered, smashed, mined, and burned their way through the stronghold until every dwarf was slain and the magnificent halls were theirs.": "110年前，卡斯(`Khors`)骑士攻占并洗劫了绯红城堡(`Scarlet Citadel`)的地面部分，但矮人们留了下来，安全地待在他们的地下堡垒里，依靠他们的戒指魔法和特别培育的恐怖猫头鹰熊(`dire owlbears`)——他们认为如此就足够安全了。但巨魔子民知道兵营的情况。一些巨魔子民甚至在建筑过程中被雇为重体力劳动者，这对矮人来说是致命的错误。在经过漫长的围攻削弱矮人之后，巨魔子民以顽强的决心攻击了要塞。一扇扇大门，一个个房间，一道道栅栏，巨魔子民破坏、摧毁、挖掘和焚烧他们的方式穿过了这座堡垒，直到每个矮人都被杀死，壮丽的大厅成了他们的。",
	"A handful of trollkin still live here. They pledge no fealty to {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, but they fear him and his lieutenants {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} and {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}, who control the levels above and below this one, respectively.": "这里仍有一小群巨魔子族居住。他们对{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}不效忠，但他们害怕他及其手下{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}和{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}，分别控制着这一层楼上下的层级。",
	"Because of the dungeon's layout, characters are unlikely to find an entrance to the lower three levels that doesn't involve coming through this level. That means they must either kill all the trollkin or strike some sort of deal with them for safe passage. The first option won't be easy, but it might be more attainable than the second. If the trollkin aren't destroyed or bribed generously, they'll be a deadly threat to the explorers' only line of retreat.": "由于地牢的布局，角色们很难找到一个不经过这一层就能进入下面三层的入口。这意味着他们必须要么杀死所有的巨魔族，要么与他们达成某种协议以获得安全通行。第一种选择不会容易，但可能比第二种更可行。如果巨魔族没有被消灭或大笔贿赂，他们将对探险者唯一的撤退线构成致命威胁。",
	"Three distinct groups coexist on this level.": "这一层有三个不同的群体共存。",
	"First is a cult of humanoids who worship Camazotz, the demon lord of bats, and a colony of giant bats that shares the cult's large cavern. Other than their fearsome high priest, cult members tend to be maimed and degenerated examples of humanoid stock. The bats, however, are healthy and savage. These creatures have nothing to do with Gellert, and he takes little interest in them.": "首先是一群崇拜蝙蝠魔王卡马佐特(Camazotz)的人形生物邪教徒，以及与邪教共享大洞穴的一群巨型蝙蝠。除了他们可怕的高级祭司外，邪教成员往往是人形生物中残缺和堕落的典型。然而，这些蝙蝠健康而凶猛。这些生物与盖勒特(Gellert)无关，他对它们几乎不感兴趣。",
	"{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC} is the second of Gellert's disciples, ranking above {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} in power and influence with their master. She is an elfmarked diabolist who shares Gellert's interest in the Void and sometimes helps directly in his research. Imortra commands several devils of significant power and can call more when needed.": "{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}是盖勒特的第二位门徒，在力量和影响力上超过{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}，与他们的导师关系密切。她是一位半精灵标记的恶魔术士，与盖勒特一样对虚空感兴趣，有时直接协助他的研究。伊莫特拉指挥着几只实力强大的恶魔，并在需要时可以召唤更多。",
	"The last group is a small band of derro outcasts who pledged themselves to Imortra out of deference to her diabolical power. They provide her some amount of security (supplementing her indentured devils) and bring her humanoid captives gathered from far and wide to serve as menial laborers and test subjects.": "最后一组是一小群德罗流亡者，他们向伊莫特拉宣誓效忠，出于对她邪恶力量的尊敬。他们为她提供一定程度的安全（补充她的契约恶魔），并带来从四面八方搜集来的人类俘虏，作为苦力和实验对象。",
	"Important features of the caverns shared by Imortra and the derro exist outside the normal reality of Midgard. They are accessible only by imbibing fungal potions distilled by the derro.": "伊莫特拉 (Imortra) 和德罗 (derro) 共享的洞穴具有重要特征，存在于中加德 (Midgard) 正常现实之外。只有通过饮用德罗蒸馏的真菌药剂才能进入这些洞穴。",
	"The earliest members of the Holzanger family who built the Scarlet Citadel, and possibly the elves before them, understood the site was the confluence of three ley lines. What they didn't know was the fortress also sat atop a stretch of the Black River (the term applied by cultists of Charun to shadow roads). Ironically, this section of shadow road coincides with a subterranean river, making the cult's metaphoric label literally true in this locale. In the manner of most theologically driven zealots, the cultists fixated on that accident of nature and invested it with an importance far beyond its simple symbolic coincidence. They carved a temple to their dark god into the caverns surrounding the river and set about their grim worship.": "Holzanger家族最早的成员建造了猩红城堡，可能是在他们之前的精灵，他们了解到这个地点是三条地脉的交汇处。他们不知道的是，这座堡垒也坐落在黑河的一段上面（Charun邪教徒对暗影之路的称呼）。具有讽刺意味的是，这段暗影之路与地下河重合，使得邪教徒对这个地方的隐喻标签在字面上成为了事实。像大多数受神学驱使的狂热者一样，邪教徒们专注于自然的这种偶然性，并赋予它远远超出简单象征巧合的重要性。他们在围绕着这条河流的洞穴中雕刻了一个供奉他们黑暗神灵的神庙，并开始了他们阴森的崇拜。",
	"Eventually, the cultists discovered the Howling Halls beneath their temple, and the head of the cult was drawn to investigate Void magic. He entered into an alliance of convenience with Void cultists, and soon they were as numerous in the temple as followers of Charun. Conflicts followed inevitably, until eventually the Void cultists declared the temple theirs and made it clear Charun's adherents were not welcome and wouldn't be tolerated.": "最终，异教徒们发现了他们庙宇下面的嚎叫大厅，该异教团的首领被吸引去调查虚空魔法。他与虚空异教徒结成了便利联盟，很快他们在庙宇中就像卡伦的追随者一样众多。冲突随之不可避免地发生，直到最终虚空异教徒宣布庙宇为他们所有，并明确表示卡伦的信徒不受欢迎，也不会被容忍。",
	"Even the Void cultists couldn't hold the temple forever. Other creatures coveted what the cultists had and challenged them for possession of the site. The Void cult defended its shrine for decades, but the enemy was persistent and patient.

	"Despite such fearsome neighbors, one resident is the undisputed master of this level: {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}.

	"At the lowest level of the dungeon is an enigma: a massive {@item sphere of annihilation}, somehow bound in place by an unknown entity in a forgotten age. It pulls terrific wind through the twisting, elementally-charged tunnels of the labyrinth. The sphere's connection to the Void makes it of great interest to {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}. Ideally, he'd like to find a way to take control of it, but that goal has eluded him for four decades. Meanwhile, the Howling Halls surrounding the sphere are flooded with elemental energy, making them by far the most dangerous places in the entire dungeon complex.": "在地牢的最底层有一个谜团：一个巨大的{@item sphere of annihilation}，以某种方式被一个在遗忘时代的未知实体束缚在那里。它通过迷宫中扭曲、元素充斥的隧道中吹来可怕的风。这个球体与虚空的联系使其对{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}非常感兴趣。理想情况下，他想找到一种控制它的方法，但这个目标已经让他苦苦追寻了四十年。与此同时，环绕着这个球体的咆哮大厅充斥着元素能量，使它们成为整个地牢复合体中最危险的地方。",
	"The site of the Scarlet Citadel is extremely potent with ley-line energy. The titanic White Road runs fewer than 60 miles to the south, and lesser ley lines crisscross the region. Most importantly, a ley line tributary wanders across almost the entire site and forms a sizable eddy beneath the fortress. Even better, this ley line forms a connection between the White Road, the Pontoretto ley line of Valera, a smaller line called the Wandering Crow, and even a shadow road to the northwest—or at least it does now, thanks to blood-soaked rituals enacted centuries ago by Gellert's ancestor Gerhardt the Elder.": "血色城堡遗址处的地势异常陡峭，充满了地脉能量。巨大的白色之路向南不到60英里，而次要的地脉在该地区交错纵横。最重要的是，一个地脉支流几乎横穿整个遗址，并在堡垒下形成一个相当大的涡流。更好的是，这条地脉连接了白色之路、瓦莱拉的庞托雷托地脉、一个名为流浪乌鸦的较小地脉，甚至是西北方的暗影之路——至少现在是这样，多亏了格勒特的祖先格哈特老者几个世纪前进行的染血仪式。",
	"This confluence and pooling of energy is all but unique in Midgard, and it's the most closely guarded secret about the site. The only way for low-level characters to uncover a bit of arcane history this esoteric would be to spend at least a month in research at one of the great libraries of Zobeck or Hirschberg—or a few hours in the Arcane Scriptorium beneath the citadel. It's why {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} and his minions value the family estate so highly in spite of its gross deterioration.

	"Characters relying on light sources can be seen by everyone, friend or foe, at any distance. No matter how quiet they are, they broadcast their approach if the halo from their light extends past the corner of a hallway or can be seen through an open doorway or under a closed door.

Some traps are meant to kill intruders, some to trap them, and some just to warn inhabitants that trouble is approaching.": "这些角色并不是第一批入侵堡垒的袭击者，因此其居民已经做好了应对这种情况的准备。血色城堡是他们的家园，而怪物和其他居民则熟知它的通道、瓶颈和死胡同，以及它的陷阱。一些陷阱旨在杀死入侵者，一些用于困住他们，还有一些只是为了警告居民有麻烦正在接近。",
	"Where traps are concerned, it's important for the GM and players to keep some things in mind.": "在考虑到陷阱时，GM和玩家需要记住一些重要事项。",
	"First, you don't want traps to become routine. Players easily fall into lazy habits such as scanning every room and hallway for traps before entering if they're allowed to. It would be a poor trap that could be spotted in a few seconds of scanning from 20 feet away. Give the trapmakers more credit than that. They work hard to conceal their handiwork.": "首先，你不希望陷阱变得司空见惯。如果玩家被允许的话，他们很容易养成懒惰的习惯，比如在进入每个房间和走廊之前都会仔细搜索陷阱。如果一个陷阱在20英尺外的几秒钟扫描中就能被发现，那将是一个很糟糕的陷阱。请给陷阱制造者更多的信任。他们努力工作来隐藏他们的手艺。",
	"Second, the {@skill Investigation} and {@skill Perception} skills are easily confused (and abused) where trap-finding is concerned. Players and GMs tend to over-rely on {@skill Perception}, which leads players to maximize their {@skill Perception} scores and ignore {@skill Investigation}. There's nothing wrong with a character specializing in something and becoming really, really good at it. The problem arises when a specialist is allowed to apply their narrow specialization in every situation, whether or not it fits.": "其次，{@skill Investigation}和{@skill Perception}技能在寻找陷阱时很容易被混淆（和滥用）。玩家和GM往往过分依赖{@skill Perception}，这导致玩家最大化他们的{@skill Perception}分数并忽视{@skill Investigation}。角色专精某项技能并在其中变得非常擅长是没有问题的。问题在于当一个专家被允许在每种情况下应用他们狭窄的专长，无论是否合适时就会出现。",
	"Here's how {@skill Investigation} and {@skill Perception} are treated in {@i The Scarlet Citadel}. Note this discussion relates  specifically to finding traps and secret doors. Both skills have uses beyond those described here.": "这里是在{@i The Scarlet Citadel}中如何处理{@skill Investigation}和{@skill Perception}的情况。请注意，这个讨论特别涉及到寻找陷阱和秘密门。这两项技能还有其他用途，不在此讨论范围内。",
	"{@skill Perception} represents a character's general awareness of surroundings and their ability to sense when something is amiss, along with their ability to spot things that are small and hard to see. A successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check tells a character something about the scene is wrong, but it doesn't necessarily reveal specifically what's wrong. Sometimes it does, but not always; it depends on the situation.": "{@skill Perception}代表角色对周围环境的一般认知以及察觉到异常情况的能力，还包括发现那些微小且难以察觉的事物的能力。成功的感知（智力{@skill Perception}）检定会告诉角色场景中有什么不对劲，但不一定会具体揭示是什么不对劲。有时候会，但并非总是；这取决于具体情况。",
	"{@skill Investigation} represents a character's ability to collate bits of information into a specific conclusion. Where {@skill Perception} often deals in hunches and instinct or in revealing the presence of something without clarifying its meaning or significance, {@skill Investigation} allows specific, sometimes seemingly unrelated details to be focused into a coherent picture.": "{@skill Investigation}代表角色将信息整合成特定结论的能力。而{@skill Perception}通常凭直觉和本能处理事情，或者揭示某种存在而不澄清其含义或重要性，{@skill Investigation}则允许将具体的、有时看似不相关的细节聚焦成一个连贯的画面。",
	"With those two definitions in mind, here's how characters can locate traps and secret doors in the citadel.": "牢记这两个定义，这里是角色如何在要塞中找到陷阱和秘密门的方法。",
	"{@b If a trap has visible features}, a successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check is enough to reveal it. A tripwire across a hallway is one example; once it's noticed, characters can just step over it. They don't know what the trap does. They could opt to trigger the trap from a distance by tossing a stick onto the wire, but that's risky without knowing what will happen. Another example would be holes in the wall with scorch marks around them; flames must shoot out of those holes. Characters don't know what triggers the trap, but they can avoid the flames by crawling under the holes or by plugging them up.": "{@b If a trap has visible features}, 一次成功的感知 ({@skill Perception}) 检定就足以揭示它。走廊上的绊线就是一个例子；一旦被注意到，角色们可以轻松跨过它。他们不知道陷阱的作用。他们可以选择远距离触发陷阱，比如扔一根棍子到绊线上，但在不知道会发生什么的情况下这是有风险的。另一个例子是墙上有烧焦痕迹的洞口；火焰必定会从这些洞口喷射出来。角色不知道是什么触发了陷阱，但他们可以通过爬过洞口下方或者堵住洞口来避开火焰。",
	"In these situations, characters can learn more about the trap by interacting with it carefully (while asking you questions). If they're still unsure what to do, they can attempt an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check at the original DC to get a clearer understanding. Encourage them to treat the situation like a puzzle instead of an exercise in dice-rolling.": "在这些情况下，角色可以通过仔细与陷阱互动（并向你提问）来了解更多信息。如果他们仍然不确定该怎么做，他们可以尝试进行一个智力检定（{@skill Investigation}）以原始难度等级来更清楚地理解。鼓励他们将情况视为一个谜题，而不是一个掷骰子的练习。",
	"This type of Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check can search one adjacent 5-foot-square area of floor or 5-foot wall section in a turn (6 seconds). Don't check separately for each area, just estimate how long the search takes and make one roll. Most rooms can be scanned this way in a minute or so.": "这种智慧检定({@skill Perception})可以在一个回合（6秒）内搜索一个相邻的5英尺正方形地板区域或5英尺的墙壁部分。不要为每个区域单独检查，只需估计搜索需要多长时间并进行一次检定。大多数房间可以在一分钟左右用这种方式扫描完毕。",
	"If a trap has no visible features—no tripwire, no spikes protruding from the ceiling, no scorch marks on the wall, no bloodstains on the floor—{@skill Perception} is much less useful. These situations are made for {@skill Investigation}.": "如果一个陷阱没有明显的特征——没有绊线，天花板上没有突出的尖刺，墙壁上没有烧焦的痕迹，地板上没有血迹——{@skill Perception} 就不太有用了。这种情况适合使用{@skill Investigation}。",
	"{@skill Investigation} requires an active search. Actively investigating a 5-foot-square area of floor or a 5-foot section of wall takes one character 1 minute. This may seem like a long time, but the characters' lives may depend on this search being thorough! It's not something to rush through.": "{@skill Investigation} 需要积极搜索。积极调查一个5英尺的正方形地板区域或一段5英尺长的墙壁需要一个角色1分钟。这可能看起来很长时间，但角色的生命可能取决于这次彻底的搜索！这不是一件应该草率对待的事情。",
	"{@skill Investigation} of a large area should be resolved with a single skill check, but it still takes 1 minute for every 5-by-5 floor square and 1 minute for every 5 feet of wall length. Thoroughly investigating a 25-foot-square room, for example, takes about 40 minutes (25 minutes for the floor plus 20 minutes for the walls minus a few minutes to account for obvious doorways).": "一个大区域的{@skill Investigation}应该通过一次技能检定来解决，但每5英尺×5英尺的地板方块需要1分钟，每5英尺的墙长也需要1分钟。例如，对一个25英尺×25英尺的房间进行彻底调查大约需要40分钟（地板25分钟加上墙壁20分钟减去一些时间来考虑明显的门口）。",
	"The time can be shortened by having multiple characters search different areas. In that case, each searcher makes an independent Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check for their own area.": "时间可以通过让多个角色搜索不同的区域来缩短。在这种情况下，每个搜索者为自己的区域进行独立的智力检定（{@skill Investigation}）。",
	"{@skill Investigation} reveals more than {@skill Perception} does. A successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check of a trap reveals the trigger and any understandable details about its effect. For example, the investigator might learn that stepping on {@i this} flagstone causes {@i that} wall panel to open, but it's impossible to know what's behind the wall panel without opening it. Successful investigation of a secret door reveals the door's location and how to open it.": "{@skill Investigation}比{@skill Perception}透露更多信息。一个成功的智力检查({@skill Investigation})可以揭示陷阱的触发器以及关于其效果的任何可理解的细节。例如，调查员可能会发现踩在{@i this}石板上会导致{@i that}墙板打开，但是不可能在不打开墙板的情况下知道墙板后面是什么。成功调查秘密门会揭示门的位置以及如何打开它。",
	"{@skill Perception} isn't useless in these situations, but all a successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check produces is a suspicion about the area, a knowing that something in it is {@i wrong}. There could be traps, or concealed doors, or something else entirely. To get more information, characters must explore more fully.": "在这些情况下，{@skill Perception}并不无用，但一个成功的智慧检定({@skill Perception})只会让人对这个区域产生怀疑，知道其中某些事物是{@i wrong}。可能会有陷阱，或隐藏的门，或者完全不同的东西。要获得更多信息，角色必须更全面地探索。",
	"{@b Magical traps} should be treated the same as traps with no visible features, but they're found with the {@skill Arcana} skill instead of {@skill Investigation}. If there are visible warning signs—a glyph carved into a stone step, for example— {@skill Perception} works as normal.": "{@b Magical traps}应该被视为没有明显特征的陷阱，但是它们是通过{@skill Arcana}技能而不是{@skill Investigation}来发现的。如果有可见的警告标志——比如刻在石阶上的符文——{@skill Perception}就像平常一样起作用。",
	"The only time a repeat check should be allowed is if the situation changes significantly. For example, an NPC telling them (not showing; that's automatic) where the door is or gaining an experience level are good reasons to allow a new try.": "唯一允许重新检查的情况是如果情况发生了显著变化。例如，NPC告诉他们（不是展示；那是自动的）门在哪里，或者获得一个经验等级都是允许重新尝试的好理由。",
	"{@b If areas being searched are more than 5 feet away}, the search can take longer or you can impose penalties on the check. Also remember that {@quickref Vision and Light||2||dim light} imposes disadvantage on visual Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks; this can be significant for characters who rely on {@sense darkvision} when scouting ahead of the main group.": "{@b If areas being searched are more than 5 feet away}, 搜索可能需要更长时间，或者你可以对检查施加惩罚。还要记住，{@quickref Vision and Light||2||dim light} 对视觉感知（{@skill Perception}）检查施加劣势；对于依赖{@sense darkvision}在主要小组前面侦察的角色来说，这可能很重要。",
	"Just seeing the {@dice d20} roll on a skill check is often enough to give players a good idea whether their attempt succeeded or failed, regardless of what you tell them about it and what their characters see afterward. Likewise, simply asking for a die roll when it seems unnecessary can tip players off that an area is more dangerous than it appears or it needs to be checked more thoroughly for secrets.": "仅仅看到{@dice d20}在技能检定中的点数，通常就足以让玩家大致知道他们的尝试是成功还是失败，无论你告诉他们什么，以及他们的角色之后看到了什么。同样地，当似乎没必要时简单地要求掷骰子，可能会让玩家意识到某个区域比表面看起来更危险，或者需要更仔细地检查是否有秘密。",
	"You can avoid these unwanted tip-offs by using the characters' passive scores. Passive {@skill Perception} is the most important of these, but others can be useful too.": "您可以通过使用角色的被动分数来避免这些不必要的提示。被动{@skill Perception}是其中最重要的，但其他分数也可能会有用。",
	"When characters approach a trap or pass a secret door, instead of asking for a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check and comparing it to the feature's DC, make a {@dice d20} roll for the feature and compare the result to the characters' passive {@skill Perception} scores. The modifier on your roll equals the feature's DC−8. For example, if text indicates noticing a trap requires a successful {@dc 14} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, then you roll a {@dice 1d20 + 6} and compare the result to the passive {@skill Perception} of characters who are in danger of triggering the trap (lower is better in this case). If characters are moving slowly and paying close attention to such things, roll {@dice 2d20} and use the lower of the two results (effectively giving the trap or secret door disadvantage to remain unnoticed). If the group is moving rapidly or not being careful in your estimation, roll {@dice 2d20} and use the higher of the two results.": "当角色接近陷阱或经过秘密门时，不要要求进行一个智力检定（{@skill Perception}）并将其与特征的DC进行比较，而是为该特征进行一个{@dice d20}检定，并将结果与角色的被动{@skill Perception}分数进行比较。你的检定修正值等于特征的DC-8。例如，如果文本指出注意到一个陷阱需要一个成功的{@dc 14}智力检定（{@skill Perception}），那么你进行一个{@dice 1d20 + 6}检定，并将结果与有可能触发陷阱的角色的被动{@skill Perception}分数进行比较（在这种情况下，较低的结果更好）。如果角色移动缓慢并且密切关注这些事物，进行{@dice 2d20}检定并使用两个结果中较低的一个（有效地使陷阱或秘密门难以被察觉）。如果团队移动迅速或在你的估计中不够小心，进行{@dice 2d20}检定并使用两个结果中较高的一个。",
	"A useful GM's technique when characters are searching for traps or secrets, trying to open a lock, or making any other skill check is to roll a {@dice d20} yourself when the players do. Players should know you're doing this, but they shouldn't see the result of the roll. Explain there are many cases in which a character has advantage or disadvantage on the check without knowing it. The {@dice d20} you roll could be helping their attempt or hurting it—or it could be you rolling a die just to keep them guessing.": "当角色搜索陷阱或秘密、尝试打开锁或进行任何其他技能检定时，一个有用的GM技巧是在玩家进行检定时自己掷出一个{@dice d20}。玩家应该知道你这样做了，但不应看到掷骰的结果。解释有许多情况下，角色在检定中具有优势或劣势，而他们并不知情。你掷出的{@dice d20}可能会帮助他们的尝试，也可能会阻碍，又或者只是为了让他们猜测而掷骰。",
	"The Scarlet Citadel is written with these assumptions about {@skill Investigation}, {@skill Perception}, and traps. As GM, you're not required to adopt any of these approaches in your game, but you should understand why certain encounters are written the way they are.": "《血色城堡》是根据对{@skill Investigation}、{@skill Perception}和陷阱的这些假设编写的。作为GM，您不必在游戏中采用这些方法，但您应该了解为什么某些遭遇被写成这样。",
	"Like traps, only one attempt should be allowed to pick a lock. Additional characters can aid in the attempt, but don't allow players to keep rolling until someone gets a high number.": "与陷阱类似，只允许尝试一次来撬锁。其他角色可以帮助尝试，但不要让玩家一直滚动骰子直到有人得到一个高数。",
	"If the attempt fails, characters have four options. They can search for the key, they can use magic such as a {@spell knock} spell or {@item chime of opening|DMG|chimes of opening}, they can smash the door open, or they can wait until they gain an experience level and try again. Unless text states otherwise, assume smashing a door open requires a successful Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check against the lock's DC + 3. Again, allow only one attempt (with aid) per experience level.": "如果尝试失败，角色有四个选择。他们可以寻找钥匙，可以使用魔法，比如{@spell knock}法术或{@item chime of opening|DMG|chimes of opening}，他们可以破门而入，或者他们可以等待直到获得一个经验等级再试一次。除非文本另有说明，假设破门需要通过一个成功的力量检定（{@skill Athletics}）来超过锁的DC + 3。再次强调，每个经验等级只允许一次尝试（可以有帮助）。",
	"If the roll to open the lock is a natural 1, the character's lockpick breaks. They'll need to get a new set of {@item thieves' tools|PHB} back in Redtower or elsewhere in the dungeon. At your option, you can allow characters without {@item thieves' tools|PHB} to try picking locks, but they do so with disadvantage and can't apply their proficiency bonus to the attempt.": "如果开锁的骰点结果是自然1，角色的撬锁工具会损坏。他们需要在Redtower或地牢其他地方重新获得一套{@item thieves' tools|PHB}。根据你的选择，你可以允许没有{@item thieves' tools|PHB}的角色尝试撬锁，但他们会带着劣势进行尝试，并且不能在尝试中应用他们的熟练加值。",
	"The early stages of the Scarlet Citadel are suitable for low-level characters (levels 1 and 2). From there, the challenge ramps up quickly as explorers press deeper into the dungeon. Characters probably won't gain enough experience in the Scarlet Citadel to advance at the same rate as the challenge. You should encourage players to return to the town of Redtower between dungeon levels and take on side quests there until they level up. Alternatively, if you're not interested in exploring the territory around the town and sending characters on secondary quests, you can ignore experience points and use milestones instead; in that case, characters gain a level each time they complete a major portion of the adventure.": "血色城堡的早期阶段适合低级角色（1级和2级）。从那里开始，随着探险者深入地牢，挑战迅速增加。角色可能不会在血色城堡中获得足够的经验来与挑战的速度保持一致。你应该鼓励玩家在地牢层级之间返回红塔镇，并在那里接受支线任务直到升级。或者，如果你对探索城镇周围的领土并派遣角色执行次要任务不感兴趣，你可以忽略经验点，改用里程碑；在这种情况下，角色每次完成冒险的一个重要部分时都会升级。",
	"A default DC is provided for those times when you need to make an on-the-fly decision about how difficult a task or saving throw should be. Challenges are generally geared toward a party of four characters. If your group is bigger than that, they may be able to deal with the Scarlet Citadel at levels 20 to 40 percent lower than what's listed here.": "在需要即时决定任务或豁免检定难度时，提供了一个默认 DC。挑战通常是针对四名角色的队伍设计的。如果你的团队人数超过四名，他们可能能够以比这里列出的等级低 20 到 40% 的水平应对 Scarlet Citadel (绯红城堡).",
	"The inhabitants of the Scarlet Citadel don't sit idly by as their sanctum is invaded and torn apart room by room. As soon as characters start fighting their way through Level 1, {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} becomes aware the complex is under attack and alerts {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}. Imortra doesn't care about {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} or any undead in the crypt, so her initial reaction is nothing more than telling {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} to deal with it. When he fails to do so (in other words, when the Arcane Scriptorium is sacked), Imortra starts taking the situation seriously.": "当血色城堡的居民看到他们的圣所被逐一入侵和摧毁时，并不坐视不管。一旦角色们开始在一层战斗，{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} 意识到复杂正在遭受攻击，并警告{@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}。伊莫特拉并不关心{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}或者地下室里的任何不死生物，所以她最初的反应只是告诉{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}去处理。当他未能做到（换句话说，当奥术抄写室被洗劫时），伊莫特拉开始认真对待这种情况。",
	"From that point on, never allow the dungeons to be static places. If characters battle through the dwarven barracks on Level 3 and kill everything in sight, then when they retreat to rest, Imortra infiltrates some of her devils or duergar back into Level 3 to ambush the characters again when they return (as adventurers inevitably do).": "从那时起，永远不要让地牢保持静态。如果角色们在3级的矮人兵营中奋战并杀尽一切，那么当他们撤退休息时，伊莫特拉（Imortra）会派遣一些她的恶魔或杜尔加（duergar）重新潜入3级，在角色们再次返回时再次伏击他们（因为冒险者们不可避免地会回来）。",
	"At the end of each level is a section titled Restocking. It covers in greater detail exactly what the dungeon's occupants do to discourage characters from coming back after they've cleared a level. In extreme cases, these even suggest attacks against the characters outside the dungeon.": "在每个级别的末尾都有一个名为“补给”(Restocking)的部分。它更详细地介绍了地牢的居民为阻止角色在清理完一个级别后再次回来所做的事情。在极端情况下，甚至会建议对地牢外的角色发动攻击。",
	"The Scarlet Citadel is intensely dangerous. Most levels include foes and situations that are too powerful even for characters of the recommended experience level for that stage of the adventure. This is intentional. Characters are expected to retreat from overwhelming danger, regroup, and use what they learn to come up with a better plan before trying again.": "血色城堡是极其危险的。大多数层级包括对于建议经验等级的角色来说甚至过于强大的敌人和情境。这是有意为之的。角色们应该从压倒性的危险中撤退，重新集结，利用所学到的东西制定更好的计划，然后再次尝试。",
	"As the Game Master, you should point this out to players before the adventure starts. Ensure they understand that recognizing when a fight is too dangerous is essential, and retreating is expected. Many players are loath to retreat from anything for any reason and would rather try to mesmerize the dice than exercise good tactical sense. They won't survive.": "作为游戏主持人，在冒险开始之前，你应该向玩家指出这一点。确保他们明白，识别出战斗过于危险时是至关重要的，撤退是可以预料的。许多玩家不愿意因任何原因而撤退，宁愿试图迷惑骰子，而不是运用良好的战术意识。他们将无法生存。",
	"If retreat is not in your group's playbook, your responsibility as GM is to brief them outside of play— probably during character creation—that they need to \"get their minds right\" about retreating. Pulling back from a fight they can't win isn't cowardly, it's smart. They're guaranteed to face that situation more than once in the Scarlet Citadel.": "如果撤退不在你们小组的策略中，作为GM，你的责任是在游戏外向他们简要解释——可能是在角色创建过程中——他们需要“调整心态”来对待撤退。从一场他们无法赢得的战斗中撤退并不是懦弱，而是明智之举。在《血色城堡》中，他们肯定会面临这种情况不止一次。",
	"Characters setting out to explore the Scarlet Citadel hear rumors about it in the nearby town of Redtower. Exactly what and how they heard about it is up to you.": "一群角色决定探索绯红城堡，在附近的赤塔镇听说了一些关于它的传闻。关于它们听到了什么以及如何听说的，就由你来决定。",
	"Information on Redtower can be found in the following chapter. A few other possibilities are listed here.": "关于红塔（Redtower）的信息可以在以下章节中找到。这里列出了一些其他可能性。",
	"{@creature Ichbon Teastrainer|KPSC}, a halfling naturalist collecting samples from the countryside, disappeared about a week ago. The innkeeper who rented Teastrainer a room is concerned about what happened to his lodger. The halfling didn't seem the sort who'd skip out on a bill.": "{@creature Ichbon Teastrainer|KPSC}，一个从乡间采集样本的半身人博物学家，大约一周前失踪了。出租房间给Teastrainer的旅馆老板对他的房客发生了什么事感到担忧。这位半身人似乎不是那种会逃账的人。",
	"{@creature Dugan Lovay|KPSC} is a trader who was expected in Redtower a few days ago. Maybe she was just delayed, but it doesn't pay to take chances in these troubled times. A committee of local merchants wants to hire some capable travelers to follow the road Lovay should be on and learn what happened. She usually travels with a knight bodyguard called the Red Hart.": "{@creature Dugan Lovay|KPSC}是一位预计几天前就应该抵达红塔的商人。也许她只是延误了，但在这个动荡时期，冒险是不明智的。一群当地商人委托一些能干的旅行者沿着Lovay应该经过的道路前去调查发生了什么。她通常会有一名骑士护卫，名为红鹿。",
	"Some dungeons are dug out with precision by massive hordes of undead workers or tribes of goblins, built in great chaos and energy to the plan of some cunning mind. The Scarlet Citadel is more of a peculiar growth of layer upon layer of tunnels, defensive halls, hidden crypts and labs, and many secrets buried deep below the surface.": "一些地牢是由大量的不死工人或地精部落精确挖掘而成，以极大的混乱和能量建造，按照一些狡猾头脑的计划。血色城堡更像是一种奇特的地下隧道、防御大厅、隐藏的地穴和实验室层层叠加的生长，许多秘密深藏在地表以下。",
	"Human settlement of the White Forest started modestly indeed at the nearby river village of Redtower. However, over time, both the village and the castle deeper in the woods became a site of importance to dungeoneers, arcane seekers, geomancers, and a certain breed of dwarven mystic. Read on and know the truth of its founding, its blood-soaked history, and its current odd decay.": "白森林的人类定居确实是在附近的红塔沿河村庄开始的。然而，随着时间的推移，无论是村庄还是更深处的城堡都成为了地牢探险者、奥术探索者、地卜师和某种类型的矮人秘术师重要的场所。继续阅读，了解它建立的真相、其血腥历史以及当前奇怪的衰落。",
	"The castle now called the Scarlet Citadel sits on the site of an ancient elven hunting lodge in the White Forest, claimed by a noble family after the Great Retreat 400-some years ago. The land was thus owned by House Holzanger, who owed fealty at various times to Illyria, the Republic of Triolo, the Canton of Melana, and (most often) to the Magdar Kingdom. Always rather deft in politics and inclined to an unambitious policy of, \"Just leave us alone with our books and hawks and hunting,\" House Holzanger might have remained a footnote if it were not for their control of the Scarlet Crow ley line and their willingness to annoy the fey lords and ladies of the forest.": "现在被称为血色城堡的城堡坐落在白色森林中一座古老的精灵狩猎小屋的遗址上，这片土地在400多年前的大撤退后被一位贵族家族所拥有。因此，这片土地归豪尔赞格家族所有，他们曾在不同时期向伊利里亚、特里奥洛共和国、梅拉纳自治区以及（最常见的）玛格达王国效忠。豪尔赞格家族在政治上总是相当熟练，并倾向于一种不雄心勃勃的政策：“请让我们和我们的书籍、鹰和狩猎保持独处”。如果不是因为他们控制着血色乌鸦魔力线并且愿意惹恼森林中的仙族领主和女士，豪尔赞格家族可能一直只是一个脚注。",
	"Originally, the pretty lodge was visited each summer and fall for boar hunts, chasing deer in the White Forest, and fish-hawking along the Templine riverbanks. The family realized the road to the lodge could also be utilized for timber transport, so the lodge became the manor for a new lumber village along the river. The lodge itself remained a place of blissful seclusion, though with some ability to gather servitors, various goods, and skilled craftspeople from the village.": "最初，这座漂亮的小屋每年夏秋季都会迎来猎野猪、在白色森林中追逐鹿群，以及沿着坦普林河岸进行捕鱼的游客。这个家族意识到通往小屋的道路也可以用于运输木材，因此小屋成为了沿河一座新木材村庄的庄园。小屋本身仍然是一个幸福隐居的地方，尽管可以从村庄中聚集仆人、各种商品和熟练的手艺人。",
	"This village was named Redleaf. At first, they sold their finest oak, ash, and rowan either east to the city of Melana or north to the Magdar merchants for barrels, barge masts, and much else. The trade was not without problems (the forest fey included some alseid and bothersome druids), but in all, it was a worthwhile little fiefdom for the Holzangers. Over time, the village grew, and then Gerhardt Holzanger came along, the first of the Holzanger sorcerers.": "这个村庄被命名为红叶村。起初，他们将最好的橡木、白蜡树和欧白山梨树卖给东边的城市梅拉纳或北边的马格达商人，用于制作桶、驳船桅杆等物品。贸易并非没有问题（森林精灵中包括一些阿尔赛德和讨厌的德鲁伊），但总体来说，对于霍尔赞格家族来说，这是一个值得的小封地。随着时间的推移，村庄不断壮大，然后格哈特·霍尔赞格出现了，他是霍尔赞格家族的第一位巫师。",
	"About 250 years ago, the young Holzanger discovered a rich ley-line tributary nearby, connecting easily to the White Road to the south and (with only modest arcane rituals) also to the shadow road to the northwest and even (with rather more strenuous and blood-soaked rituals) to the ancient Pontoretto ley line of Valera and its elven lords. The ley line itself seemed to pool and gather strength near the hunting lodge more than at the village itself, and the isolated lodge was a good place for experiments that often involved chanting, arcane lights, and the strange smells of alchemical enhancements and distillations.": "大约250年前，年轻的霍尔赞格（Holzanger）发现了附近一条丰富的地脉支流，与南部的白色之路（White Road）轻松连接，（只需适度的奥术仪式）还能与西北部的暗影之路连接，甚至（通过更加艰苦和血腥的仪式）能够连接到瓦莱拉（Valera）的古老庞托雷托（Pontoretto）地脉及其精灵领主。地脉本身似乎更多地在狩猎小屋附近汇聚和聚集力量，而不是在村庄本身，这座偏僻的小屋是进行经常涉及吟唱、奥术光芒和炼金增强以及蒸馏的奇怪气味实验的好地方。",
	"Gerhardt kept his secret for almost ten years until he took an apprentice who later ran away to Schio and told his tale. A ley line that might connect other ley lines! Ley-line philters and encasements that reacted to Void power, radiant magic, and shadow! Ley-line distillations that gave his cruel master much added strength of body and mind! The tales were wild and had the effect that the apprentice Waldmer intended—the privacy of the White Forest Lodge was a thing of the past.": "格哈特（Gerhardt）保守了他的秘密将近十年，直到他收了一名学徒，后来学徒逃到斯基奥（Schio）并讲述了他的故事。一条可能连接其他地脉线（ley lines）的地脉线！对虚空能量、光辉魔法和阴影有反应的地脉线过滤器和封装！地脉线蒸馏物给他残酷的主人带来了更强大的身体和头脑！这些故事荒诞不经，产生了学徒瓦尔德默（Waldmer）打算达到的效果——白色森林小屋的隐私成为过去时。",
	"With the wider understanding of the discovery, the area was suddenly of interest to geomancers, the shadow fey, and darker forces who wished to travel the fey roads between the three lines, plumb the mysteries of why": "随着对这一发现的更广泛理解，这个地区突然引起了风水师、影子精灵和那些希望穿越三线之间的精灵之路、探究其中奥秘的更黑暗的势力的兴趣。",
	"this backwater might connect ley lines in this way, and discover how this strong ley line might be harnessed. The first few visitors were greeted politely and told to go away. Later visitors were treated as foes. Over the years, the hunting lodge—at the ley line's strongest point—was rebuilt with the red stone common to the area, first as a single tower and then as a small keep.": "这个偏远之地也许以这种方式连接了地脉，发现这条强大的地脉如何被利用。最初的几位访客受到礼貌的招待，然后被告知离开。后来的访客被视为敌人。多年来，在地脉最强的地方，狩猎小屋被重新建造，使用了当地常见的红色石头，起初是一座孤立的塔楼，然后是一个小堡垒。",
	"Arcane secrets were under frequent investigation. Gerhardt Holzanger grew rich taking on various comely, cunning, and willing apprentices (some believe {@book Arshin the Enchanter|W02DM|3}—see {@loader Warlock #2|collection/Kobold Press; Warlock 02 Dread Magic.json}—was one of them, more long-lived than most) and having built his redstone castle on the site of the ley line's greatest resonance and generally making the most of it. He bound himself to the ley line, giving himself and his children greater strength in using its magic but also making it difficult to wander far from the Wandering Crow. At first, he could travel as far as Zigistad, Melana, and Triolo itself, but over time, this narrowed to Peltzenheim and the town of Erdovar (before its ruin) and Schio. Some believe this same ritual binds the master of Demon Mountain to his own domicile, granting him great power in a highly limited space.": "奥秘经常受到频繁调查。格哈德特·霍尔赞格（Gerhardt Holzanger）通过接纳各种美丽、狡猾且乐意的学徒而变得富有（有人认为{@book Arshin the Enchanter|W02DM|3}—见{@loader Warlock #2|collection/Kobold Press; Warlock 02 Dread Magic.json}—是其中之一，比大多数人活得更久），他在地脉共振最强的地方建造了他的红石城堡，并充分利用了这一点。他将自己与地脉绑定，使自己和他的子女在使用其魔法时更强大，但也使自己难以远离“流浪乌鸦”。起初，他可以前往齐吉斯塔德、梅拉娜和特里奥洛本身，但随着时间的推移，这一范围缩小到佩尔岑海姆和埃尔多瓦镇（在其毁灭之前）以及斯基奥。有人认为，同样的仪式将恶魔山的主人与他自己的住所绑定在一起，在高度有限的空间内赋予他巨大的力量。",
	"Despite the lack of travel, Gerhardt's private ley line offered strength and the seemingly boundless ability to study, learn, and tinker, delighting first Gerhardt and then his progeny (his wife was one Edelfrieda the Golden, said to be a druid, a sorceress, or an elfmarked petty noble of Dornig—some insist on all three). Within the reach of the White Forest, first Gerhardt the Elder and then Gerhardt the Younger and then Gertruda and Gunthar and Gerhardt III all had control over the ley lines, countering any foe or assassin skillfully, inventing new ways to charm a friend or turn an enemy into a bug. Over generations, their interests delved deep into newts and amphibians, and then the family became obsessed with horology, celestial mechanics, flotation and levitation, night creatures, angelic languages, and on and on. Always seeking knowledge purely to possess it, rarely using it to better their small barony or even to enrich themselves or their peasantry.": "尽管无法旅行，格哈特的私人地脉线提供了力量，似乎无限的学习、探索和动手能力，先是让格哈特感到愉悦，然后是他的后代（他的妻子是一位名为埃德尔弗里达·黄金的德鲁伊，据说她是多尼格的一位被认为是德鲁伊、巫师或精灵印记的小贵族——有人坚持说她具备这三种身份）。在白色森林的范围内，先是老格哈特，然后是年轻的格哈特，接着是格特鲁达和冈萨尔，以及格哈特三世，他们都掌控着地脉线，熟练地对抗任何敌人或刺客，创造新的方法来迷惑朋友或将敌人变成虫子。随着世代的传承，他们的兴趣深入研究蝾螈和两栖动物，然后家族变得着迷于钟表学、天体力学、浮力和悬浮、夜间生物、天使语言等等。他们总是追求知识，纯粹是为了拥有它，很少用它来改善他们的小领地，甚至不用来丰富自己或他们的农民。",
	"For a brief period, the area was quasi-independent, and each Holzanger sorcerer styled himself the \"Baron of Citarossa, Lord of the White Forest, and Master of the Scarlet Citadel.\" So it went for nigh 200 years: always a tiny power, always independent, though sometimes paying tribute to one power or another, and always a strange little oddity known mostly to merchants, timberfolk, and the southern Magdar villages.": "在一个短暂的时期内，这个地区几乎是独立的，每位Holzanger巫师都自称为\"西塔罗萨男爵，白色森林之主，绯红城堡大师\"。如此持续了近200年：始终是微弱的力量，始终独立，尽管有时向某个势力纳贡，但始终是一个奇怪的小怪异存在，主要为商人、木材工人和南部Magdar村庄所知。",
	"However, their overweening pride and power drew attention, and in time, an unexpected arrival ended the first age of the citadel roughly 150 years ago.": "然而，他们过分的骄傲和权力引起了注意，在一段时间后，一位意想不到的到来者结束了大约150年前的堡垒第一时代。",
	"The dwarves of the cantons and of the city-state of Melana are makers, forgers of steel, imbuing weapons with the power of Mavros and Svarog—and even Ninkash and Rava—and durable armor, enchanted barrels, and wondrous works in gold, steel, and stone. A few dwarves though, especially those of Nordmansch and Alpentor, still hew to the older ways, forging rings of surpassing power and loveliness, alive with the circling strength of runes, binding raw arcane might and turning it to fire and shadow, to glamours as durable as stone.": "卡顿（Cantons）和城邦（Melana）的矮人是钢铁的制造者、铸造者，赋予武器玛弗洛斯（Mavros）和斯瓦罗格（Svarog）——甚至宁卡什（Ninkash）和拉娃（Rava）的力量，以及耐用的护甲、附魔桶和黄金、钢铁和石头的奇妙作品。然而，一些矮人，尤其是来自诺德曼斯奇（Nordmansch）和阿尔彭托尔（Alpentor）的人，仍然坚持传统的方式，锻造出具有超凡力量和美丽的戒指，活力四射，环绕着符文的力量，将原始奥术力量捆绑并转化为火焰和阴影，制造出坚固如石头的幻术。",
	"These dwarves, the ring wardens and the ring mystics, are the keepers of lore said to have been handed down by bearded Wotan himself. Their understanding of embodying magic in physical form is rarely surpassed, and they took a keen interest in House Holzanger. When the human house was weak, they showed up one day, told Gerhardt III they would be his new soldiers and providers, and somehow either charmed him (some say the gift of an enchanted ring secured Gerhardt III's cooperation) or won him through bribery (others say the ring mystics shared their secrets of binding arcane essences into circular form and that Gerhardt himself forged dozens of powerful rings in this manner).": "这些矮人，戒指守护者和戒指秘术师，是传说中由有胡子的沃坦(Wotan)传承下来的知识守护者。他们对将魔法具现化的理解很少有人能超越，他们对霍尔赞格家族(House Holzanger)表现出浓厚的兴趣。当人类家族虚弱时，他们某天出现，告诉格哈德三世(Gerhardt III)他们将成为他的新士兵和供应者，并以某种方式迷住了他（有人说是一枚魔法戒指的礼物确保了格哈德三世的合作），或者通过贿赂赢得了他（其他人说戒指秘术师分享了将奥术精华绑定成圆形的秘密，而格哈德本人以此方式锻造了数十枚强大的戒指）。",
	"In either case, suddenly there was a company of one hundred dwarves and a half-dozen ring mages in the village of Redleaf—and many arguments with the locals over the paucity of ale and proper sausages. The dwarves chased down and tamed owlbears as hunting animals and guardians for the newly built Dwarf Hall in the village, a fine dwarven-style structure with a lookout tower. A palisade was raised to protect the village from woodland raiders. And relations between villagers and dwarves never improved. The dwarves followed Ninkash a bit too closely, often drunk and pissing in the streets or singing their endless songs late at night. The dwarven hall was a bit too fine and too imposing. Brawls were common, though the humans had much the worst of it. Complaints to Baron Gerhardt went unheeded. The owlbears ate local goats and chickens and even a beloved dog.": "在任何情况下，突然间在红叶村出现了一百个半人高的矮人和六个戒指法师，与当地居民就酒精和合适香肠的稀缺问题发生了许多争执。矮人们追捕并驯服猫头鹰熊作为狩猎动物和新建的矮人大厅的守护者，这是一座精美的矮人风格建筑，带有一个瞭望塔。村子周围筑起了栅栏，以防止森林袭击者。村民和矮人之间的关系从未改善。矮人们对尼卡什(Ninkash)的追随有些过于紧密，经常喝醉酒、在街上小便，或在深夜唱着他们无休止的歌曲。矮人大厅有些过于精致和过于威严。斗殴很常见，尽管人类受到了更严重的打击。对格哈德男爵的投诉被置之不理。猫头鹰熊吃掉了当地的山羊、鸡甚至一只可爱的狗。",
	"One night, while most of the dwarves were digging at the old Scarlet Manor Hall, the Dwarf Hall burned to the ground. The streets of the village of Redleaf glowed brightly, and the humans sang their own songs of Khors. Some of the Redleaf druids and doughtier men-at-arms mused about throwing the dwarves out entirely and \"rescuing\" Baron Gerhardt from their evil influences.": "在一个晚上，当大多数矮人在挖掘旧的猩红庄园大厅时，矮人大厅被烧毁了。红叶村的街道明亮地发光，人类唱着他们自己的Khors之歌。一些红叶德鲁伊和勇敢的武士们在思考是否应该将矮人彻底赶出去，并“拯救”从他们邪恶影响中“拯救”Gerhardt男爵。",
	"Baron Gerhardt finally saw the danger of further strife between the humans and dwarves. He called the dwarves to stay at the manor house and keep and told them to build it into a finer citadel with a new name: the Scarlet Citadel. The owlbears left the village of Redleaf to live with the dwarves, coming to the riverside village only occasionally when the baron's dwarves came calling. These grim-faced dwarves came twice a year to collect taxes or gather up barrels of ale from Peltzenheim or to send furs to their dwarven brothers in Melana and Brescia. The dungeons beneath the Scarlet Citadel were vastly expanded and improved to include owlbear stables, barracks, shrines to dwarven gods, and a vast library and workspace carved out for the Holzangers.": "Gerhardt男爵终于意识到人类和矮人之间进一步冲突的危险。他召集了矮人们留在庄园，并告诉他们将其建设成一个更好的城堡，并赋予其新名称：血色城堡。猫头鹰熊离开了Redleaf村庄去和矮人们一起生活，只有在男爵的矮人们前来时偶尔会来到河畔村庄。这些面色阴沉的矮人们每年两次前来征收税款或从Peltzenheim收集酒桶，或者将毛皮送往他们在Melana和Brescia的矮人兄弟那里。血色城堡下的地牢得到了大规模扩建和改善，包括猫头鹰熊的马厩、兵营、矮人神的神龛，以及为Holzangers开凿出的广阔图书馆和工作空间。",
	"The dwarves brought more than rings and owlbears to the Scarlet Citadel. They also brought the faith of Charun the Boatman with them from Melana, and over time, they connected some elements of the citadel with the Black River of Tears, sacred to Charun and said to be a source of connection between the mortal world and Yggdrasil or between Midgard and the many realms of the outer planes.": "矮人们不仅仅带来了戒指和猫头鹰熊到血色城堡。 他们还从梅拉纳带来了船夫卡伦(Charun the Boatman)的信仰，并随着时间的推移，他们将城堡的一些元素与泪水之河(Black River of Tears)联系在一起，这条河对卡伦而言是神圣的，据说是连接凡间世界与世界树(Yggdrasil)或者连接米德加德(Midgard)与外域众多位面之间的一处联系之源。",
	"About 130 years ago, the dwarves of the Scarlet Citadel grew impatient with what seemed like plentiful coin and ale, plus the fine magical treasures they occasionally gained from the Holzangers. Tired of hunting and guarding and drinking, and led by the canny Captain {@creature Chansar the Pale|KPSC}, they began to take empty carts pulled by enormous tamed owlbears out to the Schio-Wagenstein Road where they plundered merchants and rolled away with fine steel from Melana, copper bars, leather hides from Trombei, spices from Triolo, barrels of salt fish from Friula, and strings of Septime coin. This banditry was small at first—a trader here, a lone peddler there—but it quickly grew into a business of serious danger for trade between the Seven Cities and the Crossroads.": "大约130年前，猩红城堡的矮人们对看似丰富的金币和啤酒，以及偶尔从霍尔赞格家族那里获得的精美魔法宝物感到不耐烦。厌倦了狩猎、守卫和饮酒的生活，在精明的队长{@creature Chansar the Pale|KPSC}的带领下，他们开始驾驭巨大的驯养猫头鹰熊拉着空车前往席奥-瓦根斯坦大道，劫掠商人，抢走来自梅拉纳的精钢、来自特罗姆贝的铜条、来自特里奥洛的香料、来自弗里乌拉的盐鱼桶和一串串的塞普蒂姆硬币。这种抢劫起初规模很小——这里的一名商人，那里的一名孤立的小贩——但很快就发展成了对七城和十字路口之间贸易的严重威胁的生意。",
	"Trade is always dangerous of course, especially among the Septime cities, so the usual precautions were taken. Merchants hired guards, which slowed the banditry but made some trade quite difficult; the price of salt fish won't support a squadron of lancers. Rewards were posted.": "贸易当然是危险的，尤其是在七月城市中，因此采取了通常的预防措施。商人雇佣了护卫，这减少了抢劫，但也使一些贸易变得相当困难；盐鱼的价格支持不了一队枪骑兵。悬赏令被张贴出来。",
	"For years, various cantonal dwarves and the dwarves of Melana were blamed, for the canny dwarves of the Scarlet Citadel displayed shields and banners of Tijino, Juralt, and Melana or of famous mercenary companies within the Seven Cities. In time, however, it became clear these dwarves lived to the east of the road, and they operated from some stronghold in the White Forest. Given the notorious strength of the forest's owlbears and the well-known dangers of the sorcerers of the Scarlet Citadel taking offense at trespassers, the merchants all agreed that someone else should seek out the bandit stronghold and put a stop to the whole mess. The rewards grew larger.": "多年来，各个州的侏儒和梅拉纳的侏儒都受到指责，因为血色城堡的狡猾侏儒展示了提吉诺、朱拉特和梅拉纳的盾牌和旗帜，或者展示了七城内著名雇佣兵公司的标志。然而，随着时间的推移，很明显这些侏儒住在道路的东边，并且他们在白色森林的某个据点活动。鉴于白色森林猫头鹰熊的臭名昭著的力量，以及众所周知的血色城堡的巫师对闯入者的危险，商人们一致同意应该让其他人去寻找强盗据点并制止整个混乱。奖励也变得更加丰厚。",
	"The end of the bandit era came in a different way when canny Captain Chansar bragged a bit too loudly at Redleaf's tavern, the Cage. A young squire of the Faithful Knights of Khors was visiting the village as part of a simple devotional journey to the shrine there, and she overheard this boasting about pillaging a full mule train, so Squire Emmalyn told her sergeant of the bragging dwarven bandit. The paladins and faithful knights of Khors had recently had one of their own wine shipments from the Smolten Hills plundered by bandits, and the order's commander was incensed. A wing of knights, a squad of the Wands of Khors battle mages, and the high priest of Khors in Zigistad himself all followed the young squire Emmalyn into the White Forest to Redleaf village and then to the citadel.": "土匪时代的结束以不同的方式来临，当精明的卡普坦查恩萨在雷德利夫的酒馆，铁笼里有些夸夸其谈时。一位忠诚骑士团的年轻侍从正在该村庄进行一次简单的朝圣之旅，她无意中听到了这位矮人土匪吹嘘掠夺了一整列骡子队的事情，于是侍从艾玛琳告诉了她的中士这位吹嘘的矮人土匪。Khors忠诚骑士团最近有一批来自Smolten Hills的葡萄酒被土匪抢劫，该团的指挥官感到愤怒。一支骑士分队，一队Khors战斗法师团的魔杖，以及Zigistad的Khors高阶祭司本人都跟随年轻侍从艾玛琳进入白色森林，前往雷德利夫村庄，然后前往城堡。",
	"When the dwarves refused to hand over Captain Chansar and his accomplices to the king's justice and the mercy of Khors, the knights laid siege to the citadel for a month. In time, owlbears within the citadel ate all there was to eat, and canny Chansar sent the starving beasts out the citadel gate, expecting to make short work of the knights. He was quite mistaken; High Priest Tadeas Toller struck the owlbears with holy fire, the Wands of Khors unleashed lightning, and the countercharge carried the knights into the citadel courtyard.": "当矮人们拒绝将Chansar船长和他的同谋交给国王的审判和Khors的仁慈时，骑士们围攻了这座城堡一个月。随着时间的推移，城堡内的猫头鹰熊吃光了所有食物，精明的Chansar将饥饿的野兽送出城堡大门，期望迅速解决骑士们。他大错特错了；Tadeas Toller高阶祭司用神圣之火击打猫头鹰熊，Khors之杖释放闪电，反击将骑士们带入了城堡庭院。",
	"The battle might yet have gone to the dwarves with their crossbows firing into the courtyard from well- built arrow slits if not for the fine timbers of the keep catching fire when a lucky fireball went through an arrow slit into the interior. The Scarlet Citadel floors, stairs, rafters, and tapestries burned bright and strong, and the conflagration quickly poured smoke into the buildings, the dungeons, and the courtyard. It became impossible to shoot through the smoke and soon to breathe within the tower. The smoke and flames drove a few dwarves into the deeper tunnels, though most were forced to surrender to the waiting company of knights. Captain Chansar's body was never found, and his ring mystic lieutenant Valence Hellhand is known to have survived and fled to Nordmansch. The citadel walls still stood, blackened with smoke, and the dungeons below were no longer home to dozens of owlbears.": "如果不是一颗幸运的火球穿过箭孔进入内部，点燃了要塞的优质木材，战斗可能会由于矮人们从箭孔中向庭院射击的弩箭而转向矮人一方。绯红城堡的地板、楼梯、横梁和挂毯燃烧得明亮而猛烈，大火迅速向建筑物、地牢和庭院中涌入浓烟。射击穿过浓烟变得不可能，很快在塔内也无法呼吸。浓烟和火焰迫使一些矮人逃入更深的隧道，尽管大多数被迫向等待的骑士队投降。查恩萨队长的尸体从未被找到，而他的戒指神秘中尉瓦伦斯·赫尔汉德已知幸存并逃往诺德曼斯。城堡墙壁仍然屹立，被浓烟熏黑，地下的地牢不再是数十只猫头鹰熊的家园。",
	"But the age of the Scarlet Citadel as a functional fortress was over and done, and the cracked, blackened mortar and missing rafters meant the walls themselves were weakened. Soon other inhabitants came to the citadel, and the villagers of Redleaf came to gather up useful stone blocks and take them by wagon to reinforce their own keep and palisade. These scarlet stones were carried for miles and used with care. And one morning, a mysterious red tower was erected, making such a fine impression overlooking the village, which was soon renamed Redtower, and it has kept that name ever since.": "但是，猩红城堡作为一个功能性要塞的时代已经结束，裂开的、烧黑的砂浆和缺失的椽子意味着墙壁本身已经变得脆弱。很快，其他居民来到了城堡，红叶村的村民们来收集有用的石块，并用马车将它们运到自己的城堡和栅栏中加固。这些猩红色的石块被远远地搬运并小心使用。一天早晨，一座神秘的红色塔楼被建立起来，俯瞰着村庄，给人留下了深刻的印象，村庄很快就改名为红塔镇，从那时起就一直保持着这个名字。",
	"The sack of the Scarlet Citadel affected the village of Redtower very little indeed. Timber was still cut, some logs rafted down to Triolo to build the fleets, many of the finest timbers going north to the Magdar plain for houses, barrels—all the things for which stout oak, maple, and ash are most prized. A few arcanists came to sniff around at the ruins, though most left quickly once they met the feral owlbears or were vexed by the sprites and pixies and alseid who guarded the forest paths against intruders.": "红塔村的斯卡雷特城堡被洗劫对村庄影响甚微。木材仍在被砍伐，一些原木被筏送到特里奥洛（Triolo）用于建造舰队，许多最优质的木材被送往马格达平原（Magdar plain）用于建造房屋、桶等一切需要坚固橡木、枫木和白蜡树的物品。一些奥术师前来探查废墟，尽管大多数在遇到野生猫头鹰熊或被精灵、小妖精和阿尔赛德（alseid）阻挡森林小径的入侵者后很快就离开了。",
	"However, one group came not by forest path but by shadow road, powered by the Wandering Crow ley line. These were the cultists of Charun, the boatman between the living and the dead, whose followers took a pilgrimage from Kammae-Straboli along the Black River (as they call their temples' shadow roads) and wound up underneath the citadel. The whole company of pilgrims was quite confused at first, but the shadow-fey wizard Quendreth the  Wise immediately saw the power and strange geomantic convergence of the site. He insisted a shrine be built immediately, and he brought in shadow-fey guards and mages to embed it with power and bind the ley line.": "然而，有一群人并非通过森林小道而是通过暗影之路来到这里，他们受流浪乌鸦(Ley Line)的力量驱动。这些人是查伦(Charun)的教徒，他是生者和死者之间的船夫，他的追随者们从坎迈-斯特拉博利(Kammae-Straboli)沿着黑河前来朝圣（他们称之为他们神庙的暗影之路），最终来到了城堡下方。起初，所有朝圣者都感到困惑，但暗影精灵巫师智者昆德雷斯(Quendreth the Wise)立刻看出了这个地点的力量和奇特的地理能量汇聚。他坚持立即建造一座神龛，并带来暗影精灵卫士和法师，将其注入力量并绑定这条(Ley Line)。",
	"The small community could not find its way back to Kammae via the river, but with Quendreth's help, they did establish shadow-river connections far and wide, both deep into the Shadow Realm and to the three titanic ley lines to the west, north, and southeast. Sometimes the Black River flowed south, powered the Wandering Crow to the White Road and thus to Revskaya, Raguza, Achillon, and occasionally Harkesh. Other seasons brought connections west and north to Brescia and St. Mischau along the shadow road, and once even to Zobeck. The most difficult connections were those along the Pontoretto, sometimes to Trombei and sometimes as far as Capleon. Charun's faithful used the Black River connection quietly and without fuss, retaining it as a secret of the deeper initiates of the Temple of Charun. And even to those who never traveled the shadow rivers, it knit the community together with a physical embodiment of their faith, though only Quendreth truly seemed to understand how to pilot a vessel to connect the shadow roads, a secret he shared with no others. Or at least with no humans.": "这个小社区无法通过河流找回到卡玛埃，但在昆德雷斯的帮助下，他们确实建立了遍布遥远的影子河连接，深入到暗影界，以及通往西部、北部和东南部三条巨大的魔力线。有时，黑河向南流动，为漫游乌鸦提供动力，进而通往白路，然后到达雷夫斯卡亚、拉古扎、阿基隆，偶尔还有哈克什。其他季节会带来通往西部和北部的连接，沿着影子之路到布雷西亚和圣米绍，甚至有一次到了佐贝克。最困难的连接是沿着蓬托雷托，有时通往特罗姆贝，有时甚至远至卡普利昂。查伦的信徒们默默地利用黑河连接，保持它作为查伦神殿深层入门者的秘密。即使那些从未游历过暗影河流的人，它也用实体的方式将社区联系在一起，体现了他们的信仰，尽管只有昆德雷斯似乎真正懂得如何驾驶船只连接影子之路，这是他与其他人，或者至少是与其他人类，分享的秘密。",
	"With the cult of Charun ensconced in the lower levels of the citadel, trading with inhabitants of the underworld and using the ley line to strengthen its presence from the Seven Cities to the heart of the Dragon Empire, things changed. The arcane power of the Holzangers was passed to the Boatman's followers. Quendreth was suddenly held in high esteem among the congregants who had once made their pilgrimages entirely on the surface world, and he was granted the title of Ferryman within the church. A period of fifteen years kept him at the forefront of Charun's works over a vast territory.": "随着(Charun教派)在城堡的下层安家落户，与地底居民进行贸易，并利用地脉从七城到龙帝国核心地带加强其存在，情况发生了变化。霍尔赞格家族的奥术力量传承给了(船夫)的追随者。昆德雷在曾经完全在地表世界进行朝圣的教众中突然备受尊敬，并被授予了教会内的(渡船人)头衔。在接下来的十五年里，他在广阔领土上一直处于(Charun)事业的前沿。",
	"Alas, Quendreth was as susceptible to hubris and arrogance as many of the shadow fey, and he dabbled in Void magic, opening portals to other planes entirely, speaking to demons and devils, and inviting the satarre priestess Miskra ai-Vellec to advise him. This went about as well as you might expect, for even a less zealous priestess such as Miskra was delighted to have such power in her hands—a tool for her own plans—though she also shared much lore with Quendreth, and the two were allies of convenience for a decade. In time though, the satarre Void cultists and the true believers of Charun fell out with each other, but not before Miskra realized she could use the waters of the Black River for certain dark rituals and malign enchantments. In time, the Void cult arrived in force, and Quendreth was forced to leave quickly.": "然而，可惜的是，昆德雷思和许多暗影精灵一样，容易骄傲自大，他涉足虚空魔法，打开通往其他位面的传送门，与恶魔和魔鬼交谈，并邀请了萨塔雷祭司密斯卡·艾-维莱克为他提供建议。这一切发展如你所料，即使像密斯卡这样不那么狂热的祭司也很高兴拥有这样的力量——这对她自己的计划来说是一个工具——尽管她也与昆德雷分享了许多知识，两人在接下来的十年里是便利的盟友。然而，随着时间的推移，萨塔雷虚空教徒和真正信仰卡伦的人发生了分歧，但在此之前，密斯卡意识到她可以利用黑河的水进行某些黑暗仪式和邪恶魔法。最终，虚空教徒大举而来，昆德雷被迫匆匆离开。",
	"When the shadow-fey wizard departed, he did {@i something} to the ley line that entirely removed its ability to easily connect to the Pontoretto or the shadow road, and its connection to the White Road remained spotty at best. At the same time, Quendreth brought one of the Holzangers back to the Scarlet Citadel—the child of Gerhardt IV—to hold the place and the White Forest in perpetuity (more precisely until their return). He was called Gerhardt the Changeling and had a definite elfmarked look to him. He lived for one hundred years, and at age 70, he took a human wife from Raguza, said to be a pirate captain and certainly a hellraiser. Her name was Melanchia the Reaver, and {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} is her son.": "当影影精灵巫师离开时，他对完全移除了其轻松连接到Pontoretto或影之路的能力的地脉做了{@i something}，而其与白色之路的连接至多也只是断断续续。与此同时，Quendreth带了一个Holzangers回到了猩红城堡——格哈德四世的孩子——来永久守护这个地方和白色森林（更准确地说是直到他们的返回）。他被称为变形者格哈德，看起来明显有着精灵的特征。他活了一百年，在70岁时，他娶了来自拉古扎的人类妻子，据说是一名海盗船长，绝对是一个惹事精。她的名字是掠夺者梅兰奇亚，{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}是她的儿子。",
	"In the current age, {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} is a man of years and deep experience, certainly an older sorcerer, though still full of wild energy and fanciful plans, always striving to learn something new and keep the power of the citadel close. He is frankly too forgetful to always remember to chase away some of the Charun River cultists or to seal the Void portal when he's done with it, and horrible things creep into the citadel without him really paying attention. His son and daughter—Garent and Vespertina—are said to await the day he dies and his personal bond to the Wandering Crow ends, giving them power to use ley-line energies for their friends among the fey and the cults.": "在当前时代，{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} 是一位年迈且经验丰富的人，无疑是一位年长的巫师，尽管仍充满着狂野的能量和奇特的计划，始终努力学习新事物，并保持着对城堡力量的掌控。他实在太过健忘，无法始终记得要赶走一些查伦河邪教徒，或者在使用虚空传送门后将其封印，因此一些可怕的事物在他不太留意的情况下潜入了城堡。据说他的儿子和女儿——加伦特(Garent)和夜莓(Vespertina)——正在等待他去世的那一天，等待他与流浪乌鸦的个人联系结束，这将赋予他们使用地脉能量为精灵和邪教友人提供力量的能力。",
	"The decaying dungeons, crypts, and stones of the old Scarlet Citadel remain to be explored, their many years of rich magic interwoven with blood and betrayal. Surely some great treasures still remain, and a few of the inhabitants of Redtower—perhaps those who remember when it was Redleaf—can point a daring soul in the right direction or warn of some of its better-known dangers.": "古老的绯红城堡中的腐朽地牢、地下墓穴和石头仍待探索，其中众多年代悠久的丰富魔法与血腥和背叛交织在一起。肯定还有一些伟大的宝藏尚未被发现，而红塔的一些居民——也许是那些记得它曾经是红叶的人——可以指引一个勇敢的灵魂朝正确的方向前进，或者警告一些众所周知的危险。",
	"The town of Redtower has grown somewhat since its days as the village of Redleaf, adjusting to and even taking advantage of the new influx of adventurers, but it still has much of the same rustic, self-determined earnestness that it always had. Located on a tributary of the Templine River in southern Magdar between Peltzenheim and Schio, Redtower is an unremarkable logging settlement by itself but is better known as a launching point for adventuring expeditions into the infamous ruined castle and cave complex nearby—the Scarlet Citadel.": "红塔镇（Redtower）自从它作为红叶村（Redleaf）的日子以来已经有所发展，适应甚至利用了新一波冒险者的涌入，但它仍然保留着与往常一样的乡村风情和自主决心。红塔镇位于玛格达南部Templine河的一条支流上，介于Peltzenheim和Schio之间。红塔镇本身是一个普普通通的伐木定居点，但更为人所知的是作为冒险远征的起点，前往附近臭名昭著的废墟城堡和洞穴群——血色城堡（the Scarlet Citadel）的探险。",
	"Approaching Redtower from the northwest goes through lowland prairie toward the White Forest where Redtower is nestled within the tree line. A wooden palisade surrounds most of the town with platforms and small watchtowers attached to the palisade at each entrance. On the far southeastern corner of town, a curious redstone tower rises over the wall, itself connected to the wall via rampart. A small tributary of the Templine flows from the southwest to the northeast on the far side of town.": "从西北方向接近（Redtower）红塔，穿过低地草原，前往白色森林，红塔就隐藏在树线中。一个木栅栏环绕着镇子的大部分区域，每个入口处都附有平台和小瞭望塔。在镇子的远东南角，一座奇特的红石塔矗立在墙上，通过城墙与墙相连。一条小支流从镇子的西南流向东北，流经镇子的远端。",
	"Redtower's principal export is lumber, but the residents have adopted an entrepreneurial spirit around its status as an adventurers' destination. While many townsfolk are honest, pioneering people, it also houses plenty of opportunists looking to take advantage of adventurers flush with coin. Redtower thrives off this sort of \"adventure tourism,\" simultaneously warning travelers away from the Scarlet Citadel while peddling wares guaranteed to—supposedly—allow them to survive it. While predatory, these adventure peddlers are not lying about the dangers of the citadel: everyone in Redtower knows few who venture into the citadel ever return.": "红塔城(`Redtower`)的主要出口是木材，但居民们已经在作为冒险者目的地的地位周围形成了一种创业精神。虽然许多镇民是诚实、开拓精神的人，但也有很多机会主义者想要利用那些身怀金币的冒险者。红塔城依靠这种“冒险旅游”而繁荣，同时警告游客远离(`Scarlet Citadel`)，同时兜售能够——据说——让他们在其中生存的商品。尽管具有掠夺性，这些冒险推销员并没有在谈论城堡的危险时说谎：红塔城的每个人都知道很少有人冒险进入城堡后能够返回。",

	"Ley lines abound in the area, many of them weak and uncharted. Investigating these ley lines or the inert shadow gate nearby could be a reason for the party's interest.": "该地区充满了地脉线，其中许多是微弱且未被探索的。调查这些地脉线或附近的不活跃的暗影之门可能会成为冒险小组感兴趣的原因。",
	"Goblins and bandits are common around Redtower, particularly along the roads where they harass traveling merchants. The party could be working to quell these attacks.": "红塔附近的地精和土匪很常见，特别是在道路上，他们经常骚扰旅行商人。队伍可以努力制止这些袭击。",
	"The town of Redtower welcomes you.": "红塔镇欢迎你。",
	"Redtower's stables stretch along the northwest palisade just outside the front gate.

	"A cluster of stately buildings embraces travelers coming from the northwest into Redtower, of which the town hall is the largest.

	"If the party doesn't visit town hall on their own, Wislaw sends them an invitation within a day of their arrival to Redtower. When they arrive, he's eager to make the acquaintance of these new adventurers in town; he makes pleasant conversation, plies them with food and drink, and welcomes their expedition. He plays up the threat of the Scarlet Citadel and the dangers roaming the woods but assures them they're in the best place to get equipped to face it. He claims to be so impressed that he authorizes them to use his name at the local merchants for a \"special\" discount.": "如果队伍没有主动去市政厅，Wislaw会在他们到达Redtower的第二天内发送邀请。当他们到达时，他急切地想要结识这些新来的冒险者；他进行愉快的交谈，款待他们食物和饮料，并欢迎他们的探险。他夸大了朱红城堡的威胁以及漫游在树林中的危险，但保证他们在这里是获得装备来面对它的最佳地方。他声称对他们印象深刻，授权他们在当地商人那里使用他的名字以获得“特别”折扣。",
	"Dropping Wislaw's name among the merchants is actually a signal that the characters are promising marks, and the merchant raises their prices accordingly and gives the mayor a cut. Raise the cost of goods and services by 10% whenever the PCs use the mayor's name; if they inquire, merchants explain demand is too high in Redtower, and without the mayor's go-ahead, prices would be higher. Otherwise, goods and services are priced as normal.": "在商人中提到Wislaw的名字实际上是一个信号，表明这些角色是有潜力的目标，商人会相应地提高价格并给市长一部分。每当PCs使用市长的名字时，将商品和服务的成本提高10%；如果他们询问，商人会解释在Redtower需求太高，没有市长的同意，价格会更高。否则，商品和服务的定价如常。",

	"Between the Cage Tavern ({@area R4|SC-R4|x}) and town hall ({@area R2|SC-R2|x}) is a prominent landmark in the town's center: a disused temple of Khors. The octagonal walls of the temple remain strong, as do the stoic-faced knightly statues flanking the doors on the temple's northwest face. Once inside, the temple's neglect is obvious: the elements have partially eroded the roof, leading to a section of collapse just beyond the door. Despite the added debris, the stone pews and large frescoes inside the temple are mostly intact, as is the altar standing at the southeast wall. The temple sits on a large patch of cleared, flat land intended for use as a training ground, but nature is reclaiming it with patches of grass and wildflowers.": "在笼子酒馆({@area R4|SC-R4|x})和市政厅({@area R2|SC-R2|x})之间是镇中心的一个显著地标：一座废弃的科尔斯神庙。神庙的八角形墙壁仍然坚固，门口两侧的骑士雕像面容冷峻，守护在神庙西北面的门前。一旦进入，神庙的荒废显而易见：风吹雨打已经部分侵蚀了屋顶，导致门口之后的一部分倒塌。尽管有额外的碎石，神庙内的石凳和大型壁画大多完好无损，东南墙上的祭坛也是如此。神庙坐落在一大片已清理、平坦的土地上，本来打算用作训练场，但大自然正在重新占领，草地和野花点缀其间。",
	"There hasn't been a priest at the temple in decades, so its upkeep has waned.

	"The Cage is the most visibly imposing structure upon entering Redtower by virtue of its unique construction and namesake: a row of curved bones, much like some massive ribcage, protrude from the ground in a corridor to the tavern's southern-facing wall and side entrance. The last few ribs are incorporated into the inn's construction, acting as supporting rafters visible on the inside of the building. The rest of the Cage's construction is eclectic, with the older parts of the inn—the space immediately connected to the enormous ribcage—of the wood-and-stone construction typical of the region but with newer elements showing more distant touches: sweeping iron gables from Zobeck, a dwarven-style hearth from the Ironcrags, Perunalian motifs in the columns, and so on.": "进入（红塔）时，（笼子）是最引人注目的结构，其独特的建筑和名字使其如此。一排弯曲的骨骼，就像一些巨大的肋骨，从地面伸出，在通向酒馆南墙和侧门的走廊中。最后几根肋骨被纳入客栈的建筑中，作为内部可见的支撑横梁。笼子的其余部分建筑风格多样，客栈的旧部分——与巨大肋骨直接相连的空间——采用了当地典型的木石结构，但新元素显示出更遥远的影响：来自佐贝克的铁瓦，来自铁峰的矮人式壁炉，柱子上有佩鲁纳利亚的图案等。",
	"Considering Redtower's small size and populace, the Cage is surprisingly full-featured: it boasts several rooms from comfortable to aristocratic in quality, though it has only one aristocratic suite. Owing to its adventurous— and often wealthy—patronage, travelers can find lodgings and fare suitable for up to a wealthy lifestyle.": "考虑到红塔(Redtower)的规模小和人口稀少，笼子(The Cage)却出奇地设施齐全：它拥有从舒适到贵族质量的几个房间，尽管只有一个贵族套房。由于它的冒险性——通常是富有的客户群，旅行者可以找到适合豪华生活方式的住宿和饮食。",
	"The Cage's name—and unique construction element— supposedly dates back to the town's earliest days as Redleaf when the proprietors' ancestors, Milena and Henrik Gjorski, slew a mighty giant on the spot the inn now rests. The toll of the fight would mean the end of their adventuring career, but they returned to this site of their last great battle to retire. They found the giant withered and scavenged to little more than a massive ribcage and decided to build an inn around it, preserving it as their final—and biggest—trophy.": "这个酒馆的名字——以及独特的建筑元素——据说可以追溯到镇上早期作为红叶镇时，业主的祖先米莉娜和亨利克·格约斯基在这个酒馆现在所在地杀死了一只强大的巨人。这场战斗的代价意味着他们冒险生涯的终结，但他们回到了他们最后一次伟大战斗的地点退休。他们发现巨人已经干瘪，只剩下一副巨大的胸腔，于是决定在周围建造一座酒馆，将其保留为他们最后——也是最大的——战利品。",

The pair arrived in Redtower as boat workers, wound up overdrinking at the Cage with some adventurers, and missed their boat to leave. Deciding to put their vice to good use, the two brewed up some concoctions that won over visiting adventurers, so they took over the brewery, naming it the Sweet Sap. Not being forest folk, they insist the name was a nod to Redtower's livelihood and nothing to do with the ingredients.

	"South of Agniezka's smithy ({@area R8|SC-R8|x}), past the gate over the southeast road, a squat stone tower sits on a little hillock where it connects to the town's timber palisade. It is a defensive fortification but also the town's namesake: the stones of the tower are somewhat faded but still a deep crimson.

Theories and rumors about it abound, however, and can be heard on the {@table Gossip Table|KPSC}.": "在阿格涅兹卡铁匠铺({@area R8|SC-R8|x})以南，穿过东南路上的大门，一个矮胖的石塔坐落在一个小土丘上，与城镇的木栅栏相连。这是一个防御设施，也是城镇的名字来源：塔的石头有些褪色，但仍然是深红色的。即使是在笼子里的阿里亚德娜和安布罗齐也不知道这座塔是如何建造的。然而，关于它的理论和传言却层出不穷，并可以在{@table Gossip Table|KPSC}上听到。",
	"The temple of the Gear Goddess is an odd, circular building in the southeast of town. Eight double windows protrude at even spaces around the temple, and its center is a small clearing, giving it a cog-like appearance from above. The building itself is a blend of wood and stone construction that, unlike the temple of Khors, has been well maintained. Reaching the temple of Rava from the road requires wading through a collection of the Spinner's \"sacred\" scrap: broken things, metal bits, and discarded items are given places of honor here.": "齿轮女神殿是镇上东南部一个奇特的圆形建筑。庙宇周围有八扇双层窗户，均匀分布，中心是一个小空地，从上方看起来像一个齿轮。建筑本身是木石结构的混合体，与Khors神殿不同，这座庙宇一直保持得很好。从道路到达Rava神殿需要穿过一堆Spinner的“神圣”废料：破碎的物品、金属碎片和被丢弃的物品在这里被赋予了尊贵的地位。",
	"The interior of the temple opens into a large chamber that circles to the left and right.

His last assignment came from a group of noble thrill seekers from Cronepisht, looking to conquer the Scarlet Citadel; some sinister trap unleashed waves of undead on them before they made it far, and Konrad barely escaped with his own life—and what treasures they'd found before the end. He chose a long life against an adventurous one and settled in Redtower, pursuing the entrepreneurial opportunity he saw in appealing to an adventurer's greed for power.": "{@creature Konrad of Runkelstad|KPSC} 住在这里，是一位退休的战斗法师，他在为王国效力和作为一名自由佣兵（人类 {@creature mage|MM}）时赚了一大笔财富。他的最后一次任务是来自克罗尼皮斯特的一群贵族冒险家，他们想征服绯红城堡；在他们走得很远之前，一些邪恶的陷阱释放了大批不死生物，康拉德勉强逃脱，并带着他们在灾难结束前找到的宝藏。他选择了长寿而不是冒险生活，并在红塔镇定居，追求他看到的满足冒险者对权力贪婪的创业机会。",

	"Eva doesn't hesitate to welcome the party inside and treats them with ciders, apple pies, and nosy questions.

The looming presence of the citadel itself can't be ignored as Gellert's henchmen and experiments do not always stay contained.": "尽管红塔（Redtower）在白色森林（White Forest）边境开辟了一个相对安全的地盘，但即使没有城堡，这个地区也是相当危险的。这里的植物和动物受到魔法和{@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}的影响而发生了变化，这里可能隐藏着一些更好不去探索的神秘。城堡本身的悬而未决的存在也不容忽视，因为盖勒特（Gellert）的手下和实验并不总是受到控制。",

	"A small hut cobbled together from loose stone and reclaimed wood perches on the opposite side of the riverbank northeast of Redtower. The hut looks like it has been knocked down and rebuilt multiple times, evidenced by the scattering of half-buried debris around it. On the south side of the hut is a large, gnarled tree with a sturdy, covered platform nestled in its branches. It is of much better construction than the hut below.": "在红塔东北的对岸，有一座用松散的石头和回收木材拼凑而成的小棚屋。这座小屋看起来像是被拆除并多次重建过，周围散落着半埋的碎片，证明了这一点。在小屋的南侧是一棵古老的、多瘤的大树，树枝上有一个坚固的、有顶的平台。这个平台的建造质量比下面的小屋要好得多。",
	"This is the home of Tobiasz, an elderly human {@creature commoner|MM} hermit who once lived in Redtower but grew horrified by the complicity of the townsfolk in letting adventurers run to their slaughter in the Scarlet Citadel. He takes it upon himself now to warn people away, which is why he hasn't left yet; he goes into Redtower only for supplies and to shame the townsfolk. Otherwise, he spends his time writing letters to Queen Dorytta to bring an army to raze the citadel once and for all. Tobiasz's trade is carpentry, and he built both the hut and tree stand, which is where he flees to when monsters inevitably attack. The hut, on the other hand, has been ransacked so much he only bothers with \"good enough.\"": "这是托比亚斯(Tobiasz)的家，一个年迈的人类{@creature commoner|MM}隐士，曾经住在红塔，但对镇民在斯卡雷特城堡让冒险者去送死的勾结感到震惊。他现在自己承担起警告他人的责任，这也是他为什么还没离开的原因；他只进红塔买些必需品并羞辱镇民。除此之外，他的时间都花在给多丽塔女王写信，希望她带领军队彻底摧毁城堡。托比亚斯的手艺是木工，他建造了小屋和树台，当怪物袭击时，他会逃到树台上。小屋则经常被洗劫，他只顾“勉强够用”了。",

	"Set in a small clearing in the woods southwest of Redtower is an airy temple to the Twin Gods, Yarila and Porevit, Mother Field and Father Harvest. The temple itself is a roomy structure with few walls and has archways instead of doors. The roof supports come from wooden posts wrapped in ivy and vines, most of them in perpetual bloom. An altar to the Twin Gods is set before the temple structure, an elevated stone block skirted by flowers and bountiful fruits and vegetables. In a rectangular periphery around the altar is a \"fence\" of stakes in the ground, marking growth stands of tomatoes, berries, grapes, and other seasonal crops.": "位于雷德塔西南的树林中的一个小空地上，是一座供奉双神雅里拉(Yarila)和波列维特(Porevit)的通风庙宇，分别代表着母亲田野和父亲丰收。这座庙宇本身是一个宽敞的建筑，几乎没有墙壁，而是用拱门代替门。屋顶的支撑来自缠绕着常年开花的常春藤和藤蔓的木柱。庙宇前设有一个供奉双神的祭坛，一个高耸的石块，周围围绕着鲜花和丰盛的水果蔬菜。在祭坛周围的矩形边缘上，是一圈插在地上的桩子，标志着番茄、浆果、葡萄和其他季节作物的生长区。",

	"The focal point of the clearing is a weather-worn stone arch, lopsided and half-sunk into the ground, its engravings faded with the passing of eras. A withered black vine winds around both sides of the arch, never blooming but also never crumbling. The vines are unyielding and cold as iron when touched, and the stone itself imparts such a frigid sensation that, even in the hottest summers, the chill on the skin lingers for hours.": "这片空地的焦点是一个风化的石拱门，歪斜地半埋在地里，上面的雕刻随着岁月的流逝而褪色。一根干枯的黑藤蔓缠绕在拱门的两侧，从不开花也从不崩塌。当触摸到这些藤蔓时，它们坚韧而冰冷如铁，而石头本身则传递出一种刺骨的感觉，即使在炎炎夏日，皮肤上的寒意仍然持续数小时。",
	"The arch once led to a shadow road that fed into the greater White Road nearby. At some point, the connection collapsed, and the arch went dormant. Recently, however, the archway has been showing signs of life, prompting interest from others in the region.": "这个拱门曾经通向一条影子之路，它汇入附近更大的白色之路。在某个时候，这个连接崩溃了，拱门变得沉寂。然而最近，这个拱门开始显示生机的迹象，引起了该地区其他人的兴趣。",

	"No path leads to Zula's cottage in the woods near the northwestern road into Redtower. The party might stumble into her cottage clearing or perhaps notice the trail of hearth smoke above the trees.

	"The door is ajar just enough for an unarmored Small creature to slip through if it makes a successful {@dc 12} Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. Otherwise the door moves and squeaks loudly unless the hinges are oiled beforehand— which is difficult to do because the hinges are on the opposite side of the door. If a Small character slips through and oils the hinges, the rest of the party can get through quietly.

	"The largest, nastiest-looking hook hangs motionless above a five-foot hole in the floor that drops into blackness. Something is lashed to the hook—a pair of lacerated human hands, gnawed off at the wrists. The chain extends through a pulley attached to the ceiling and back down to a winch with hundreds of feet of chain spooled around it.": "一根最大、看起来最恶心的钩子悬挂在地板上一个五英尺深的洞口上方，洞口通向黑暗。有什么东西被绑在钩子上——一对被撕裂的人类手，被咬断在手腕处。链条穿过连接在天花板上的滑轮，再回到一个绕着数百英尺链条的绞盘上。",
	"When a body needs to be disposed of—usually a dead body, but not always—{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} ties it to the hook at the end of the chain and has {@creature Scar|KPSC} lower it through the hole in the floor.

Before the corpses animate into {@creature zombie|MM|zombies}, they're just corpses, and damage dealt to them has no effect.

	"The zombies can be wherever in the chamber you want them, but they should be spread around. If a zombie can attack a creature while hanging from its chain, it does. Otherwise, zombies must spend 5 feet of movement dropping off the chain before approaching their targets.": "僵尸可以在房间里任何地方，但它们应该分散开来。如果一个僵尸可以在悬挂在链条上的情况下攻击生物，它会这样做。否则，僵尸必须花费5英尺的移动来从链条上掉下来，然后接近它们的目标。",

	"The chest contains {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}'s most precious belongings: trophies of his victims.

	"{@creature Ushulx|KPSC} is a blood cultist who venerates Charun in the domain of death. She perceives the river as a metaphor for blood flowing through arteries and believes Charun is connected to the Dry Lands because of the proximity of this shrine to the crypt ({@area Areas 116|SC-116|x}–{@area 119|SC-119|x}) and its connection to the Dry Lands. This philosophy is heretical both in mainstream views of Charun and in most blood cults, which is why {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} skulks here beneath the Scarlet Citadel.": "{@creature Ushulx|KPSC} 是一名崇拜夏隆的血腥邪教徒，在死亡领域中崇拜他。她将河流视为血液在动脉中流动的隐喻，并相信夏隆与干旱之地有关，因为这座神龛与干旱之地的地下墓穴({@area Areas 116|SC-116|x} - {@area 119|SC-119|x}) 非常接近。这种哲学观点在夏隆的主流观点和大多数血腥邪教中都是异端邪说，这就是为什么{@creature Ushulx|KPSC} 在绯红城堡下面潜伏。",
	"The statue was created and placed here by the elves before the coming of the Holzangers. It has two magical properties: one was instilled centuries ago by the elves, the other by {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} and {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} working together.": "这座雕像是由精灵在Holzangers到来之前创造并放置在这里的。它具有两种魔法属性：一种是几个世纪前由精灵注入的，另一种是由{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}和{@creature Ushulx|KPSC}共同合作注入的。",
	"The recent enchantment triggers a bolstered {@spell animate dead} spell that affects the corpses hanging in the oubliette ({@area Area 102|SC-102|x}). This requires smearing a few drops of blood onto the statue near Charun's feet and speaking a command phrase known to {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}, {@creature Ushulx|KPSC}, and {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}. The corpses animate into {@creature zombie|MM|zombies} for 4 hours, under the control of the person who animated them, after which they revert to corpses.": "最近的魔法触发了一个增强的{@spell animate dead}咒语，影响了深坑{@area Area 102|SC-102|x}中悬挂的尸体。这需要在卡鲁恩脚边的雕像上涂抹几滴血，并说出一个只有{@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}、{@creature Ushulx|KPSC}和{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}知道的口令。这些尸体会变成{@creature zombie|MM|zombies}，持续4小时，由激活它们的人控制，之后它们会恢复成尸体。",
	"The enchantment placed by the elves is triggered by grasping Charun's oar with both hands and speaking the phrase \"the river beckons, boatman\" in Aklo ({@language Deep Speech|PHB}). The creature is teleported to the blood shrine on Level 5 ({@area Area 513|SC-513|x}) and arrives with its hands plunged into the blood font. Only Gellert and Imortra know this property of the statue and the correct phrase to trigger it.": "精灵施放的魔法由用双手握住查伦的桨并说出“河流招手，船夫”这句Aklo语（{@language Deep Speech|PHB}）来触发。生物会被传送到第5层的血祭坛（{@area Area 513|SC-513|x}），并且双手深深地插入血池中。只有盖勒特和伊莫特拉知道这座雕像的这个特性以及触发它的正确短语。",
	"Nothing in this chamber is trapped or inherently dangerous. Only its occupants present a danger to the characters. If a general melee breaks out on this level, {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} and {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} are likely to shelter in this room, with {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} sniping at targets in the torture chamber through the wall opening while {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} watches them battle his animated torture devices.": "这个房间内没有设置陷阱或固有危险。只有房间内的居住者对角色构成危险。如果在这一层发生混战，{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} 和 {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} 可能会躲在这个房间里，而{@creature Ushulx|KPSC}则可能通过墙上的开口向拷问室的目标进行狙击，同时{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}则会看着他们与他的活动拷问装置作战。",
	"The connection between this chamber and the torture chamber was crudely bashed through the wall when the citadel was overrun. The connection to the ancestral shrine ({@area Area 113|SC-113|x}) is similar but required much more extensive tunneling.": "当堡垒被攻陷时，这个房间与拷问室之间的连接是通过墙壁粗暴地砸开的。与祖先神龛({@area Area 113|SC-113|x})的连接类似，但需要进行更加广泛的隧道挖掘。",
	"{@creature Ushulx|KPSC} despises {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}, and she has no particular animosity toward the characters unless they give her a reason to. If the characters demolished the {@creature zombie|MM|zombies} with ease and appear to be winning a battle in the torture chamber— or if the reverse is true and the characters could use some help—{@creature Ushulx|KPSC} may be willing to strike a deal with them. This is a chance for a dramatic uptick. Decide whether the most interesting thing is for {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} to help the characters against {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} or for {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} to aid {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} and {@creature Scar|KPSC}.": "{@creature Ushulx|KPSC} 鄙视 {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}，她对角色们并没有特别的敌意，除非他们给她一个理由。如果角色们轻松摧毁了 {@creature zombie|MM|zombies}，并且似乎正在赢得一场在拷问室中的战斗——或者反过来，如果角色们需要一些帮助——{@creature Ushulx|KPSC} 可能愿意与他们达成交易。这是一个戏剧性增长的机会。决定最有趣的事情是 {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} 帮助角色们对抗 {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}，还是 {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} 协助 {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} 和 {@creature Scar|KPSC}。",
	"{@creature Ushulx|KPSC} helping the characters doesn't mean she's had a change of heart about her evil ways. She sees {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} and {@creature Scar|KPSC} as liabilities whose cruelty will eventually bring down the wrath of Redtower on the citadel. In exchange for her help, {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} wants to be left alone. She tells characters how to reach the staircase down ({@area Area 112|SC-112|x}) and warns them the crypts are extremely dangerous. A good option here is to allow {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} to accompany the characters into the crypts. She explains that she's always wanted to explore them but it was too dangerous to do so alone. You can easily arrange for her to be killed by a {@creature shadow|MM}, a {@creature specter|MM}, or a {@creature wight|MM} in {@area Area 116|SC-116|x} (possibly when she sneaks off hoping the characters will be killed), then the party can run into an undead {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} later in the adventure!": "{@creature Ushulx|KPSC}帮助角色并不意味着她已经改变了自己邪恶的方式。她认为{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}和{@creature Scar|KPSC}是会招致红塔之怒的负担。为了帮助，{@creature Ushulx|KPSC}想要独自离开。她告诉角色如何到达下方的楼梯({@area Area 112|SC-112|x})，并警告他们地下室非常危险。在这里一个好的选择是允许{@creature Ushulx|KPSC}陪同角色进入地下室。她解释说她一直想探索地下室，但一个人做太危险了。你可以安排她被{@area Area 116|SC-116|x}中的{@creature shadow|MM}、{@creature specter|MM}或{@creature wight|MM}杀死（也许当她偷偷离开希望角色被杀时），然后在冒险后期队伍可以遇到一个不死生物{@creature Ushulx|KPSC}！",
	"In any case, being helpful isn't the same as being a friend or an ally. In the end, {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} wants the characters dead, and she's certain they'll be killed if they proceed to deeper levels. Helping them head down to the arcane scriptorium or into the crypts is her way of sending them to their deaths. If the characters are disrespectful or try to bully her, {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} warns {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} that intruders are on the way (assuming she isn't killed in the crypts).": "无论如何，帮助并不等同于成为朋友或盟友。最终，{@creature Ushulx|KPSC} 想要角色们死去，她确信如果他们继续前往更深的层次，他们将被杀害。帮助他们前往奥术书房或地下室是她送他们赴死的方式。如果角色们不尊重她或试图欺负她，{@creature Ushulx|KPSC} 警告 {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} 说有入侵者在途中（假设她没有在地下室中被杀）。",
	"This chamber must be a storeroom. Small casks of water, preserved meat, bread, and vegetables are stacked against the north wall.": "这个房间一定是一个储藏室。小桶装着水、腌肉、面包和蔬菜堆放在北墙边。",
	"This chamber is actually a trap for any prisoner who manages to escape from their cell. {@creature The Gaoler|KPSC} hopes the prospect of food and water will lure people here, where they'll trigger the trap and be re-caught.": "这个房间实际上是一个陷阱，专门用来捕捉任何设法从牢房逃脱的囚犯。{@creature The Gaoler|KPSC} 希望食物和水的诱惑会吸引人们来到这里，然后触发陷阱并再次被捉住。",
	"The supplies are the trap. If anything is taken from the pile, iron bars drop from the ceiling across both doorways, trapping anyone in the room. The trigger wires and the holes in the ceiling near the doors can be detected with a successful {@dc 13} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. A successful {@dc 13} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals the holes the bars fall out of but not the trigger.": "这些物资是陷阱。如果从堆里拿走任何东西，铁栅栏会从天花板上落下，挡住房间的两个门。通过成功的{@dc 13}智力({@skill Investigation})检定可以发现触发线和靠近门的天花板上的孔。通过成功的{@dc 13}智慧({@skill Perception})检定可以发现栅栏掉落的孔，但无法发现触发器。",
	"The squeal and clang of the falling bars brings {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} and {@creature Scar|KPSC} to the area immediately.": "当金属栅栏倒下时发出的尖叫声和撞击声立刻吸引了{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}和{@creature Scar|KPSC}前来。",
	"The bars latch into place after dropping. The latches can be released from hidden spots in {@area Areas 107|SC-107|x} and {@area 109|SC-109|x}, or they can be tripped with a successful {@dc 15} Dexterity ({@item Thieves' Tools|PHB}) check. This check can be repeated until it succeeds, but the character must be in the square directly adjacent to the doorway and is likely to be under attack from {@creature Scar|KPSC} while making the attempt. Once unlatched, the bars can be lifted by anyone with a Strength score of 8 or higher.": "在下降后，这些门闩会卡入位置。这些门闩可以从{@area Areas 107|SC-107|x}和{@area 109|SC-109|x}的隐蔽位置释放，或者可以通过成功的{@dc 15}敏捷({@item Thieves' Tools|PHB})检定来触发。这个检定可以重复进行，直到成功为止，但角色必须站在门口直接相邻的方格内，并且在尝试时很可能会受到{@creature Scar|KPSC}的攻击。一旦解锁，任何力量分数达到8或更高的人都可以将这些门闩抬起。",
	"This cell is in most respects identical to those in {@area Area 105|SC-105|x}, including the bars and locking door. This door isn't locked, and a key hangs on a wall peg on the opposite side of the corridor. The cell contains no comforts of any kind, not even a heap of straw to soften the cold stone.": "这个牢房在大多数方面与{@area Area 105|SC-105|x}中的牢房相同，包括铁栅栏和上锁的门。这扇门没有上锁，在走廊的对面墙上挂着一把钥匙。牢房里没有任何舒适设施，甚至没有一堆稻草来软化寒冷的石头。",
	"{@creature Scar|KPSC} sleeps here and often sulks here when {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} doesn't need him and there are no prisoners to prod or frighten. {@creature The Gaoler|KPSC} sometimes locks {@creature Scar|KPSC} in this cell on those infrequent occasions when he's displeased with the ogre—usually because {@creature Scar|KPSC} killed a prisoner, accidentally or otherwise, without {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}'s permission.": "{@creature Scar|KPSC} 在这里睡觉，当{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} 不需要他时，或者没有囚犯需要他戳或吓唬时，他经常在这里闷闷不乐。在那些罕见的情况下，{@creature The Gaoler|KPSC} 有时会把{@creature Scar|KPSC} 锁在这个牢房里，通常是因为{@creature Scar|KPSC} 未经{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} 允许杀死了一个囚犯，无论是意外还是故意，{@creature The Gaoler|KPSC} 对食人魔感到不满。",
	"The only item of any kind in the cell is a brooch that's carefully wrapped in a scrap of wool and wedged into a crack in the wall. It can be spotted with a quick search of the cell and a successful {@dc 13} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. The brooch is of elven manufacture, and glimmers of its stunning original beauty can still be seen even in its damaged state. It's made of silver and mithral wire set with blue spinels. Only two of the original five gems remain; they're worth 200 gp each.": "牢房里唯一的物品是一枚胸针，被小心地包裹在一块羊毛碎片中，并塞进墙缝里。通过对牢房的快速搜索和成功的{@dc 13}感知({@skill Perception})检定，就能发现它。这枚胸针是精灵制造的，即使在受损状态下，仍然可以看到它闪烁着令人惊叹的原始美丽。它由银和秘银丝线制成，镶有蓝色尖晶石。原本五颗宝石中只剩下两颗；它们价值每颗200金币。"
