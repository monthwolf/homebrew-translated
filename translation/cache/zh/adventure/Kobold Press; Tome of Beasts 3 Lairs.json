In any case, the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} does not go after her or the sheepdogs, focusing instead on the PCs or escape.": "这个建议也适用于{@creature Fancy|ToB3-Lairs}和三只牧羊犬，卢西(Lucy)、达特(Dart)和普里西拉(Priscilla)。如果玩家遇到困难，它们可以帮助玩家，但强烈建议不要让{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}伤害它们。至于格兰博(Grumbo)，他拒绝让牧羊犬冒险；如果有威胁，他会派{@creature Fancy|ToB3-Lairs}，但她的灵巧守护者特性应该能帮助她避免受伤。无论如何，{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}不会追击她或牧羊犬，而是专注于玩家或逃跑。",
	"The {@creature herd skulker|ToB3|herd skulker's} natural form bears similarities to that of wolves, but it should not be depicted as anything but the horrible monster that it is. If harming a creature that resembles a real animal would distress your players, modify the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3|herd skulker's} true form to something altogether alien.": "{@creature herd skulker|ToB3|herd skulker's}的自然形态与狼类相似，但不应被描绘成除了它是可怕的怪物之外的任何东西。如果伤害类似真实动物的生物会让你的玩家感到不安，请将{@creature herd skulker|ToB3|herd skulker's}真实形态修改为完全陌生的东西。",
	"A short, wooden fence surrounds a large sheep pen that occupies the northwest quarter of Grumbo's farmstead. Lazing within are thirty sheep, though others wander in and out of the open twenty-foot-wide gate on the western side. More sheep graze in the pastures surrounding the farmstead. Several fuzzy lambs chase each other enthusiastically, the older sheep observing disinterestedly. One of the lambs approaches the fence and baas at you in greeting.": "一道矮木栅栏环绕着格伦博农场的西北角，围着一个大羊栏。里面悠闲地躺着三十只羊，还有其他羊在西侧开着的二十英尺宽的大门进进出出。更多的羊在农场周围的牧场上吃草。几只蓬松的小羊羔兴高采烈地追逐着彼此，年长的羊漠然旁观。其中一只小羊走近栅栏，对你发出咩咩的问候声。",
	"Grumbo keeps the gate open during the day and closes it at night, though a determined predator can easily leap the low fence. The sheep, too, will leap the fence at the first sign of a predator, which may necessitate the PCs locating them. The lamb that greets the PCs is Lady Lanolyn of Lambshire.": "Grumbo白天保持大门开着，晚上关闭大门，尽管一个决心坚定的捕食者可以轻松跃过低矮的篱笆。羊群也会在发现捕食者的第一个迹象时跃过篱笆，这可能需要玩家定位它们。迎接玩家的小羊是(Lady Lanolyn of Lambshire)。",
	"A large goat pen surrounded by a low, wooden fence occupies the northeast quarter of the farmstead. Milling about inside are twenty goats, and you can see more goats grazing in the pasture beyond the pen as well. The wide gate on the eastern side of the fence is open, allowing the goats the freedom to go in or out. Several downy kids gambol about within and are occasionally joined by the older goats. One baby goat approaches the fence when you near, sticking his nose out for a scritch or a treat.": "农场东北角有一个由低矮木栅栏围起来的大山羊围栏。里面有二十只山羊在走来走去，你还可以看到更多山羊在围栏外的牧场上吃草。围栏东侧的宽大门敞开着，让山羊自由出入。几只毛茸茸的小山羊在里面嬉戏，偶尔会有年长的山羊加入进来。当你走近时，一只小山羊走到栅栏边，伸出鼻子让你抚摸或给予食物。",
	"Like the sheep pen, Grumbo keeps the gate open during the day and closes it at night. A determined predator, such as the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3}, can leap the easily low fence, as can all but the smallest of the goats. The kid seeking scritches is Sir Cashimir of the Order of the Fleece.": "就像羊栏一样，格伦博（Grumbo）白天保持大门开着，晚上关闭。一个决心强大的捕食者，比如{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}，可以轻松跃过低矮的篱笆，所有除了最小的山羊之外。寻找抚摸的小羊羔是羊毛骑士团（Order of the Fleece）的卡希米尔爵士（Sir Cashimir）。",
	"Grumbo's small house is located in the southwestern portion of the farmstead. He welcomes you inside, insisting on providing tea and cookies for all. The interior of the cottage is immaculate and homey. Overstuffed pillows and plush rugs cover the floor, a comfy bed occupies the northwest corner, a table for six sits in the center, and a wood-burning stove graces the southeast corner. Custom cabinets and closets are built into the walls. Three merry sheepdogs lie in a tangle on a fluffy dog bed near the stove.": "格兰博（Grumbo）的小屋位于农场的西南部分。他欢迎你进入屋内，并坚持为所有人提供茶水和饼干。小屋的内部整洁而温馨。充满填充物的枕头和柔软的地毯铺满地板，一张舒适的床占据了西北角，一张可容纳六人的桌子位于中央，一台燃木炉点缀了东南角。定制的橱柜和壁橱嵌入墙壁中。三只欢快的牧羊犬躺在炉边的蓬松狗床上。",
	"Grumbo painstakingly built this home. The door doesn't have a lock, as Grumbo has little fear of intruders. Even if the door is left wide open, the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} does not enter.": "格兰博(Grumbo)辛苦地建造了这座家。门上没有锁，因为格兰博对入侵者几乎没有恐惧。即使门敞开着，{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}也不会进来。",
	"Grumbo leads you to a neatly painted red barn and opens the doors. Most of the stalls are empty, save for the four nearest the door, which contain a cow, two draft horses, and a pony. Grumbo points to the cow. \"Pinkle here is a good cow. She's very patient.\" He waves his hand in the direction of the horses. \"Binny and Winny are a tad lazy, but they do their jobs.\" Finally, he stops at the stall of the pony, who noses his hand, and hands her a carrot. \"Theodora is the best pony that ever lived. I'm riding her to the fair.\"": "格兰博（Grumbo）带领你来到一座粉刷整洁的红色谷仓，并打开了门。大部分的畜栏都是空的，除了靠近门口的四个，里面分别装着一头奶牛、两匹工作马和一匹小马。格兰博指着那头奶牛说道：“这是平克（Pinkle），是一头好奶牛。她非常耐心。”他挥手指向那两匹马说：“宾尼（Binny）和温尼（Winny）有点懒散，但它们会完成工作。”最后，他停在小马的畜栏前，小马用鼻子蹭了蹭他的手，他递给小马一根胡萝卜。“西奥多拉（Theodora）是有史以来最好的小马。我要骑她去参加集市。”",
	"Like everything else on Grumbo's property, the barn's been kept immaculate.": "就像格伦博（Grumbo）财产上的一切一样，谷仓一直保持得一尘不染。",
	"Grumbo points out a substantial chicken coop east of the barn. \"Happy chickens lay tasty eggs. That what I always say.\" He waves at a hen squawking at several others. \"Penelope keeps the other hens in line.\" He nods at the lone rooster. \"Cody mostly keeps to himself, though a couple of the hens like him quite a bit.\"": "Grumbo指出谷仓东边有一个相当大的鸡舍。\"快乐的母鸡会下美味的蛋。这是我一直说的话。\"他挥手示意一只母鸡对着其他几只母鸡大叫。\"佩内洛普( Penelope )让其他母鸡守规矩。\"他点点头看着那只孤独的公鸡。\"科迪( Cody )大多数时候独来独往，尽管有几只母鸡很喜欢他。\"",
	"A large vegetable garden lines the southern edge of the farmstead, featuring neat rows of cucumbers, radishes, tomatoes, onions, zucchini, and turnips.": "农场的南边种着一个大菜园，里面整齐排列着黄瓜、小红萝卜、番茄、洋葱、西葫芦和萝卜等作物。",
	"Grumbo loves gardening almost as much as raising animals. He doesn't need to say so; this bounteous garden and the numerous flower boxes scattered around the property make that clear.": "格兰博（Grumbo）热爱园艺，几乎和饲养动物一样。他无需言语，这个丰盛的花园和散落在房产周围的众多花箱清楚地表明了这一点。",
	"Each night the PCs stay at Grumbo's farm, they have a chance to catch the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} in the act, but it's a clever and cautious foe with an uncanny ability to disappear within herds, so it will be difficult. Though the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} possesses a dangerous bite, it's a coward and runs if it feels threatened.": "每晚PCs在格兰博农场住宿时，他们有机会抓到{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}的行踪，但这是一个聪明而谨慎的敌人，有着在群体中消失的神奇能力，所以这将是困难的。虽然{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}拥有危险的咬击能力，但它是懦夫，如果感到受到威胁就会逃跑。",

	"On a success, the PCs notice the creature entering the chicken coop and arrive in time to stop it before it attacks. The {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} flees (using its Spring Attack ability to avoid {@action opportunity attack||opportunity attacks}) when the PCs arrive and attempts to hide amongst one of the other groups of animals. If a PC blocks the entrance to the chicken coop, the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} leaps at them, attempting to shove them out of the way so it can escape.": "在成功的情况下，玩家角色注意到生物进入了鸡舍，并及时赶到阻止它攻击。当玩家角色到达时，{@creature herd skulker|ToB3} 使用其“春季突袭”能力逃跑（避开{@action opportunity attack||opportunity attacks}）。如果有玩家角色挡住鸡舍的入口，{@creature herd skulker|ToB3} 会向他们扑过去，试图推开他们以便逃跑。",
	"On a failure, the PCs hear a commotion of squawking chickens. When they arrive at the coop, the chickens are running around wildly, screeching, the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} hidden among them. If the PCs hesitated for more than a round before rushing to investigate, the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} assumes its true form, eats one of the chickens, then shifts back into a chicken before they arrive.": "失败时，玩家角色听到一阵鸡叫声。当他们赶到鸡舍时，鸡们疯狂地四处奔跑，尖叫着，其中{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}藏匿其中。如果玩家角色在冲去调查之前犹豫了超过一轮，{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}会变回真实形态，吃掉一只鸡，然后在他们到达之前变回鸡的形态。",
	"The animals are all on edge, as if they can sense the danger in the air.": "动物们都很紧张，仿佛能感受到空气中的危险。",
	"PCs proficient in {@skill Animal Handling} have a well-honed sense of animal behavior.

	"If the animals are questioned using magic, they communicate that there's a new animal in the pen that doesn't smell right. If the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} is still present, the animals can direct the PCs to it. Being not terribly intelligent, they have little useful information, but if the PCs spend too long trying to talk with them they might allow the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} to slip away.": "如果动物被魔法询问，它们会传达说畜栏里有一种新动物，闻起来不对劲。如果{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}仍然在场，动物可以引导玩家找到它。它们并不是非常聪明，提供的信息有限，但如果玩家花太长时间试图与它们交谈，它们可能会让{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}溜走。",

	"It is important to remember that the herd skulker is a monstrosity, not a beast—even though it much of the time looks and acts like a beast. Accordingly, spells that only affect beasts will not work on the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3}.

	"The {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} waits for the PCs to relax before it risks attacking one of the goats or sheep. If the PCs remain vigilant, it spends the rest of the evening among the animals, then attempts to slip away when Grumbo opens the gate for the goats to graze at dawn, wandering off to sleep until nightfall. Vigilant PCs can attempt a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check opposed by the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3|herd skulker's} {@skill Stealth}; on a success, the PCs can spot the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} attempting to slink away.": "{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}在PC们放松下来之前等待，然后才冒险攻击山羊或绵羊中的一只。如果PC们保持警惕，它会在动物中度过余下的夜晚，然后在格兰博在黎明时打开大门让山羊吃草时尝试溜走，漫步到处睡觉直到夜幕降临。警惕的PC可以尝试进行一次感知（{@skill Perception}）检定，对抗{@creature herd skulker|ToB3|herd skulker's}的{@skill Stealth}；如果成功，PC可以发现{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}试图溜走。",
	"If the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} reveals itself to any of Grumbo's animals, each PC may attempt a DC 13 check to hear them crying or otherwise sense the disturbance, using one of the following skills: Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}, {@skill Perception}, or {@skill Survival}) or Intelligence ({@skill Nature}).": "如果{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}向格伦博(Grumbo)的动物中的任何一只显露出来，每位玩家角色可以尝试进行一次DC 13检定，使用以下技能之一来听到它们的哭声或其他感知到的干扰：感知({@skill Animal Handling})、调查({@skill Perception})、或生存({@skill Survival})，或者智力({@skill Nature})。",
	"On a success, if the PCs immediately rush to investigate, they catch the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} before it attacks.

	"On a failure, the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} heads back to the farm to hide, either in the stables or in the sheep or goat pen, where Grumbo's animals still remain.

	"If the PCs detect the animals' distress but delay rushing to their aid for a round, they arrive at the scene to discover frantic sheep and goats running about the pasture.

	"The {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} continues to play these games with the animals and PCs for the up to three nights; after the third night, if the PCs do not drive it off or kill it, the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} will wander off in search of easier prey.": "{@creature herd skulker|ToB3} 在接下来的三个晚上继续与动物和PCs玩这些游戏；在第三个晚上之后，如果PCs没有赶走或杀死它，{@creature herd skulker|ToB3} 将离开寻找更容易的猎物。",

	"If the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} kills any of Grumbo's animals—but none of his four prized babies (Fuzzington, Lanolyn, Lambert, and Cashimir)—Grumbo will give the PCs the initial 50 gp reward and will still pay the 50 gp bonus if a PC succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check or if there is a fellow halfling in the party who is kind (or at least not unkind) to Grumbo.

	"If the PCs dispatch the {@creature herd skulker|ToB3} after it has killed any of Grumbo's prize animals, he grudgingly gives them the 50 gp reward but refuses to pay any more than that. He is absolutely despondent, as if he had lost a member of his own family and is not shy about expressing his extreme disappointment in the PCs' failure to follow through on their promise to protect his flock. Grumbo cancels his plans to attend the Wool-Off this year, too overcome with grief to make the journey.": "如果PCs在{@creature herd skulker|ToB3}杀死了格伦博的任何珍贵动物后将其解决，他会不情愿地给予他们50金币的奖励，但拒绝支付更多。他绝对感到沮丧，就像失去了自己家人一样，并且毫不掩饰地表达了对PCs未能兑现保护他羊群承诺的极度失望。格伦博取消了今年参加羊毛节的计划，因为过于悲伤而无法踏上旅程。",

	"While the PCs deal with their own fears, a number of the caravan's camels equal to the number of PCs break their bindings and bound down the desert trail. Due to their movement speed (50 feet), the camels likely leave any pursuing PCs in the literal dust.": "当玩家角色(PCs)处理他们自己的恐惧时，与PCs数量相等的一些(dnd)商队的骆驼挣脱了绳索，在沙漠小径上飞奔。由于它们的移动速度(50英尺)，这些骆驼很可能会把任何追赶的PCs甩在身后。",

Time is of the essence, because the next high tide or storm could carry away any treasures currently in Lonely Cove.": "Finlay Barrett是一名臭名昭著的海盗和走私者，他驾驶着他的船，{@i Dead Reckoning}号船。Barrett是一位老练的水手，但即使是最经验丰富的水手也会遭遇自然的阻挠。{@i Dead Reckoning}号船在一场可怕的风暴中沉没，船只的一部分和货物现在被冲上了孤独海湾，这是一个位于高耸砂岩悬崖脚下的孤立海滩。关于这次沉船的消息迅速传开。雄心勃勃的人迅速行动，收集他们能找到的Barrett携带的任何贵重物品。时间紧迫，因为下一次高潮或风暴可能会带走目前在孤独海湾的任何宝藏。",
	"The following can be used to start the PCs on this adventure:": "以下内容可用于开始本次冒险中的玩家角色（PCs）：",
	"{@b {@i Chance Encounter.}} The PCs are aboard a passing ship and spy the wreckage. They convince the captain to drop anchor so they can row ashore and investigate, or perhaps the captain commissions them to do so, in order for the ship to claim salvage rights.": "{@b {@i Chance Encounter.}} 人物角色们正在一艘经过的船上，他们看到了残骸。他们说服船长停船，让他们划船上岸调查，或者船长委托他们这样做，以便船只能主张打捞权益。",
	"{@b {@i Rumor Has It.}} A survivor of the {@i Dead Reckoning} was brought into port aboard a naval cutter. Rumors are flying around town about the wreck and the possibility that Finlay Barrett's treasure is out there for the taking.": "{@b {@i Rumor Has It.}）一名{@i Dead Reckoning}的幸存者被带到了一艘海军切割机上。镇上到处都是关于这次失事和芬利·巴雷特的宝藏可能在外面等待着被发现的传言。",
	"{@b {@i Hired Hands.}} A merchant named Deverick Stanmore who was recently preyed on by Barrett wishes to recover a family heirloom the pirate plundered from his ship; it's a jewel-encrusted dagger with the words \"We Were, We Are, We Will Be\" engraved on the blade. He's willing to pay 200 gp for its safe return.": "{@b {@i Hired Hands.}} 最近被巴雷特掠夺的商人迪维里克·斯坦莫尔希望找回海盗从他船上掠夺的家族传世之宝；这是一把镶有宝石的匕首，刀刃上刻有“我们曾经，我们现在，我们将来”字样。他愿意支付200金币以换取其安全归还。",
	"You arrive at Lonely Cove at low tide. This section of coast is comprised of sheer, towering sandstone cliffs. The interior of the cove is a crescent of rocky beach surrounded by tidal pools. You can see the front half of the Dead Reckoning run aground on the rocks just offshore of the northern end of the beach. To the south, a dark opening of a cave can be clearly seen in the cliff wall. Debris from the ship, barrels, crates, and other containers, float in the pools or lie washed up on the beach.": "你在低潮时抵达了孤独海湾。这段海岸由陡峭、高耸的砂岩悬崖组成。海湾的内部是一片被潮池环绕的岩石海滩的新月形。你可以看到“死亡航线”号的前半部分搁浅在海滩北端近岸的礁石上。向南，你可以清楚地看到悬崖墙上一个黑暗的洞口。船上的碎片、桶、箱子和其他容器漂浮在潮池中，或者被冲上海滩。",
	"Within the confines of the tidal pools and beach, the PCs only have to contend with the inhabitants of Lonely Cove as indicated in the numbered encounter areas. However, should they spend time in the deeper waters outside the cove, they find that one of the reasons the cove bears its name is that this area is known for its predators, which keep local fishermen and others away from the locale. For every hour the PCs spend afloat, there is a {@chance 25|25%} chance of an encounter with {@dice 1d3} {@creature reef shark||reef sharks} or one {@creature swarm of quippers}. If anyone is actually in the water, the chance increases to {@chance 40|40%}; if anyone is wounded and in the water, the chance increases to {@chance 75|75%}.": "在潮池和海滩的范围内，PCs 只需与《孤独海湾》的居民在编号遭遇区域中交锋。然而，如果他们在海湾外更深的水域中停留，他们会发现海湾得名的原因之一是这个地区以其掠食者而闻名，这些掠食者使当地渔民和其他人远离这个地方。PCs 每漂浮一小时，就有 {@chance 25|25%} 的几率遭遇 {@dice 1d3} {@creature reef shark||reef sharks} 或一个 {@creature swarm of quippers}。如果有人实际在水中，几率增加到 {@chance 40|40%}；如果有人受伤并在水中，几率增加到 {@chance 75|75%}。",
	"Several barrels float in a tide pool at this end of the beach.": "几个桶漂浮在海滩这一端的潮池中。",
	"The tidal pools of the cove are the domain of a {@creature beach weird|ToB3}. The creature moves freely along the length of the cove and can be encountered anywhere in the tidal pools on the map, arriving in {@creature 1d4} rounds at any of the numbered areas if the PCs linger at a location for longer than 1 minute. It is upset with the intrusion of the wreckage and other creatures that the recent storm brought into the area, attacking any creatures it notices that do not normally reside in its domain. It pursues fleeing foes, but not out into the deeper waters or up onto the beach itself.": "{@creature beach weird|ToB3}潮池的领主是一只{@creature beach weird|ToB3}。这种生物可以自由地沿着海湾的长度移动，并且可能在地图上潮池的任何地方遇到它，在PC停留在某个位置超过1分钟后，{@creature 1d4}回合内它可能出现在任何编号区域。它对残骸和其他生物的侵入感到不满，这些残骸是最近风暴带到这个地区的，它会攻击任何它注意到不是正常居住在其领地的生物。它会追击逃跑的敌人，但不会追到更深的水域或者上到海滩上。",
	"Among the other cargo items that were washed into Lonely Cove are the remains of ship's rum supply. Each of these barrels can be sold for 20 gp.": "在被冲入孤独海湾的其他货物中，还有船上的朗姆酒供应的残余。每个这样的酒桶可以卖出20 gp。",
	"The front end of a sloop is run aground on the rocks here, the wreck leaning hard to starboard. The mast has snapped and fallen, its crossbeam and furled sail soaking in the water below. What sounds like mournful birdsong can be heard coming from the inside of the shattered hull, as well as the sounds of scratching and skittering, like claws on wood.": "一艘单桅帆船的船头搁浅在这里的岩石上，残骸向右倾斜。桅杆已经折断倒下，横梁和卷起的帆在下面的水中浸泡着。从破碎的船体内部传来一种像是哀伤的鸟鸣声，还有像是爪子在木头上划动的刺耳声。",
	"This is most of what remains of the {@i Dead Reckoning}. The back half of the ship is sunk beneath the waters off the cove, and the vast majority of its cargo sunk with it or is scattered here in the cove. However, a section of the cargo remains lashed down and in place within the bow of the cargo deck. Barrett often made money capturing rare and exotic creatures from far-off lands and selling them as pets or private zoo exhibits to unscrupulous nobles and other wellto-do patrons. Two of his recent finds are here in the wreck.": "这是{@i Dead Reckoning}的大部分残骸。船的后半部分沉没在海湾的水下，大部分货物也随之沉没或散落在海湾中。然而，在货舱的船头位置，有一部分货物仍然被捆绑固定在原位。巴雷特经常通过捕捉来自遥远地区的稀有和奇特生物，将它们作为宠物或私人动物园展品出售给不道德的贵族和其他富裕的顾客来赚钱。他最近发现的两个物种就在这次沉船事故中。",
	"Inside the hull, a stack of crates, lashed and secured to the deck, stands against the port side. At the top of the stack sits a cage containing the source of the sad singing, a bird that looks like an eagle-sized finch—a {@creature moon weaver|ToB3}. Also present—but uncaged—is a {@creature guardian archaeopteryx|ToB3}; it's the size of a small dog, and this particular archaeopteryx has had its wings clipped, thus it cannot sustain flight for more than 25 feet and must land at the end of its movement.": "在船舱内，一堆货箱被捆绑并固定在甲板上，靠近左舷。在货箱堆的顶部，有一个笼子，里面关着发出悲伤歌声的来源——一只看起来像鹰大小的雀鸟——一只{@creature moon weaver|ToB3}。另外，还有一只未被关在笼子里的{@creature guardian archaeopteryx|ToB3}；它的大小相当于一只小狗，这只特殊的始祖鸟已经被剪断了翅膀，因此它不能持续飞行超过25英尺，必须在移动结束时着陆。",
	"The archaeopteryx is hungry and would rather feast on the {@creature moon weaver|ToB3} than fend for itself against the {@creature giant crab||giant crabs} that roam the beach. It has been attempting, unsuccessfully thus far, to reach the {@creature moon weaver|ToB3}, which is still locked in its cage, wedged atop the stack of crates. The dinosaur defends itself against any intruders, but attempts to flee elsewhere if brought below half its hit points.": "始祖鸟感到饥饿，它宁愿吃掉{@creature moon weaver|ToB3}，也不愿与漫步在海滩上的{@creature giant crab||giant crabs}自行捕食。它一直在试图，但迄今为止都未成功地到达{@creature moon weaver|ToB3}，这只怪兽仍然被锁在笼子里，卡在箱子堆的顶部。这只恐龙会保护自己免受任何入侵者的伤害，但如果生命值降到一半以下，它会试图逃往其他地方。",
	"The {@creature moon weaver|ToB3|moon weaver's} cage is locked, but it can be picked with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|phb}. The creature has also had its wings clipped and suffers the same flight penalties as the dinosaur. It takes at least six months for either creature to grow enough new plumage to regain its full flight speed.": "{@creature moon weaver|ToB3|moon weaver's}的笼子被锁住，但可以通过使用{@item thieves' tools|phb}成功进行一次DC 12的敏捷检定来打开。这只生物的翅膀也被剪短，遭受与恐龙相同的飞行惩罚。任何一种生物至少需要六个月的时间才能长出足够的新羽毛，恢复完整的飞行速度。",
	"The crates still in the hull contain mundane goods, most of which have been ruined by exposure to seawater. However, with a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check, searching the deck of the wreck uncovers a polished wooden case that has been wedged under the fallen mast. A successful DC 12 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check is needed to pull the case loose.": "船舱里仍然放着一些普通货物，其中大部分已经被海水浸泡而毁坏。然而，通过成功的 DC 12 智力检定({@skill Investigation})，在沉船的甲板上搜寻时，会发现一个被卡在倒下的桅杆下的抛光木盒。需要成功的 DC 12 力量检定({@skill Athletics}) 来将木盒拉出。",
	"The lock on the case was damaged during the wreck, but inside is a red velvet-lined interior, inside of which is a jewel-encrusted {@item dagger|phb} with the words \"We Were, We Are, We Will Be\" engraved on the blade.": "箱子上的锁在事故中受损，但里面是一片铺着红色天鹅绒的内衬，里面有一把镶嵌着宝石的{@item dagger|phb}，刀刃上刻着“我们曾经，我们现在，我们将来”这几个字。",
	"If the archaeopteryx is killed or chased off, the {@creature moon weaver|ToB3} attempts to communicate its wishes to be freed from its cage. While intelligent, it does not speak {@language Common}, and it is unlikely the PCs know its language. It has a passing familiarity with {@language Common} if spoken to, though it only recognizes common words and phrases. The {@creature moon weaver|ToB3} also readily responds to simple codes, such as \"Whistle once for yes, two for no.\" If treated well, the {@creature moon weaver|ToB3} might become a companion to one or more of the PCs, until it has an opportunity to return home.": "如果始祖鸟被杀死或赶走，{@creature moon weaver|ToB3} 会试图传达它希望被释放出笼子的愿望。虽然聪明，但它不会说 {@language Common}，而且很可能玩家角色不懂它的语言。如果与之交谈，它对 {@language Common} 有一定了解，尽管只能识别常见的词语和短语。{@creature moon weaver|ToB3} 也会很快地对简单的密码做出反应，比如“吹一声口哨代表是，吹两声代表否”。如果受到善待，{@creature moon weaver|ToB3} 可能会成为一个或多个玩家角色的伙伴，直到有机会返回家园。",
	"Several crates have washed up on the rocky beach here among a scattering of planks and other debris.": "几只板条箱被冲上了这块岩石海滩，周围散落着一些木板和其他碎片。",
	"The beach is the haunt of a {@creature talus flow|ToB3}. The elemental subsists mainly on whatever {@creature giant crab||giant crabs} it can catch. The {@creature talus flow|ToB3} can be found anywhere on the beach, but its constant hunger for the bodily fluids of living creatures means an attack on anything that lingers for too long on any part of the beach.": "海滩是{@creature talus flow|ToB3}的栖息地。这个元素主要靠捕捉它能抓到的任何{@creature giant crab||giant crabs}来维持生存。{@creature talus flow|ToB3}可以在海滩的任何地方找到，但它对活生物体液的持续渴望意味着对任何停留在海滩任何部分时间过长的东西发动攻击。",
	"The crates here are still intact, but can be opened with a successful DC 10 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check (with disadvantage if no {@item crowbar|phb} or similar tool at hand). Most of the crates have been inundated with seawater, ruining their contents, but four still contain items of value. The first crate holds various tools and sealed containers of herbs, enough to comprise a total of 10 {@item herbalism kit|phb|herbalism kits} (worth 5 gp each). The second contains sealed jugs of rare dyes (worth 50 gp total). A third crate holds waterlogged, ruined books, but also a small box containing 4 {@item potion of healing||potions of healing}. The fourth crate contains 10 lbs. of incense (worth 25 gp).": "这里的货箱仍然完好无损，但需要进行一次成功的DC 10力量检定（带有劣势，如果没有{@item crowbar|phb}或类似的工具在手边）。大部分的货箱已经被海水淹没，毁坏了里面的物品，但还有四个货箱里面有价值物品。第一个货箱里有各种工具和密封的草药容器，总共10个{@item herbalism kit|phb|herbalism kits}（每个价值5 gp）。第二个货箱里有密封的珍贵染料罐（总价值50 gp）。第三个货箱里有浸水破损的书籍，但也有一个小盒子里有4个{@item potion of healing||potions of healing}。第四个货箱里有10磅的香料（价值25 gp）。",
	"The bottom of this deep tidal pool is thick with growing seaweed that waves in the current. A shiny form can be seen moving about amidst the foliage.": "这个深潮池的底部长满了在水流中摇曳的海草。在这些叶子之间可以看到一个闪亮的身影在移动。",
	"A {@creature pescavitus|ToB3} was another of the rare creatures Finlay Barrett captured and had planned on selling. The box containing the creature spilled into this tide pool as the remains of the ship beached. The creature was able to free itself, but by then the tide had gone out and it found itself trapped here. Should it notice the presence of the PCs, it comes cautiously to the surface to converse. It would like to be freed from the pool and released into the ocean so it can escape. It offers to use any of its magical abilities on the party's behalf in exchange for its release. If attacked, the {@creature pescavitus|ToB3} flees to the bottom of the tidal pool, which is about 12 feet deep, defending itself if pursued.": "{@creature pescavitus|ToB3}是费恩利·巴雷特捕获并计划出售的另一种稀有生物。包含这种生物的箱子在这个潮池中倒出，当时船只的残骸搁浅在这里。这种生物设法挣脱了，但那时潮水已经退去，它发现自己被困在这里。如果它注意到PC的存在，它会谨慎地浮出水面与他们交谈。它希望被从潮池中解救出来，并释放到海洋中逃跑。它愿意为释放它提供任何魔法能力，作为交换。如果遭到攻击，{@creature pescavitus|ToB3}会逃到潮池底部，潮池大约有12英尺深，如果被追击会进行自卫。",
	"Beyond the various detritus floating on the surface here, a number of colorful objects can be seen on the sand at the bottom of this tidal pool.": "除了漂浮在表面的各种碎片外，在这里可以看到潮池底部的沙滩上有一些色彩缤纷的物体。",
	"The {@i Dead Reckoning} was carrying a haul of expensive cloth and furs taken from a merchant ship. Most were lost in the deep water, but some of the smaller bolts made it to this tidal pool. The PCs can find the following: a 5-yard bolt of gold and silver brocade (worth 40 gp); an 8-yard bolt of white muslin (worth 32 gp); a 10-yard bolt of wool dyed midnight blue (worth 80 gp); and a small bundle of assorted furs (worth 34 gp).": "{@i Dead Reckoning} 正在携带一批从一艘商船上劫掠的昂贵布料和毛皮。大部分都在深水中丢失了，但一些较小的布匹漂到了这个潮池。角色可以找到以下物品：一匹5码长的金银提花布匹（价值40 gp）；一匹8码长的白色纱布（价值32 gp）；一匹10码长的深夜蓝色羊毛布匹（价值80 gp）；以及一小捆各种毛皮（价值34 gp）。",

	"A chest sits at the bottom of this 4-foot-deep pool. A successful DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check notices it without moving the debris or entering the water.

	"The two {@creature giant crab||giant crabs} here discovered the body of one of the pirates washed ashore and are currently fighting over the food. They don't attempt to injure one another; they are simply posturing in an attempt to drive the other off and claim the prize. If the PCs approach, the crabs abandon their argument in order to go after the new, fresh sources of food.": "这里的两只螃蟹发现了一名海盗的尸体被冲上岸，它们目前正在为食物而争斗。它们并不试图伤害对方；它们只是在摆姿势，试图赶走对方并夺取食物。如果PCs接近，螃蟹们会放弃争论，转而去追逐新鲜的食物来源。",
	"This section of beach is littered with what at first looks like shards of wood, bleached white from exposure to sun and salt. Upon closer inspection, however, they are revealed to be jagged, broken pieces of the shells of giant crabs. Among the smaller pieces, you can see sections of legs and even a couple of claws half-buried in the rocks. Nearby, to the east, a cave mouth looms in the side of the cliff.": "这一片海滩上到处都是一些乍看起来像是被阳光和盐水曝晒得雪白的木片。然而，仔细一看，它们实际上是巨大螃蟹壳的锋利断片。在更小的碎片中，你可以看到一些腿部和甚至一些爪子半埋在岩石中。在附近的东边，一座洞穴的入口在悬崖的一侧隐约可见。",
	"The {@creature giant crab||giant crabs} that reside and breed in the sea cave here are the main prey of the {@creature talus flow|ToB3} that dominates the beach (see {@area 3|4.3|u}). It catches them here as they make their way from the cave out to the water, hence the signs of carnage. This is also why this location is the most likely spot for PCs to encounter the {@creature talus flow|ToB3} if they have not already done so elsewhere.": "这里的海洞中栖息繁衍的{@creature giant crab||giant crabs}是沙滩上主宰者{@creature talus flow|ToB3}的主要猎物（见{@area 3|4.3|u}）。{@creature talus flow|ToB3}在这里捕捉它们，因为它们从海洞到水中的过程中会经过这里，因此留下了屠杀的迹象。这也是为什么如果PCs还没有在其他地方遇到{@creature talus flow|ToB3}的话，这个地点是PCs最有可能遇到{@creature talus flow|ToB3}的地方。",
	"A {@creature guardian archaeopteryx|ToB3} wanders this section of beach, cautiously scavenging among the crab shells for any remaining scraps. This creature is the mate of the other archaeopteryx aboard the {@i Dead Reckoning} (see {@area 2|4.2|u}) that that Barrett captured in the hopes of forming a breeding pair in order to sell the offspring to collectors of exotic creatures. It attacks despite being outnumbered by larger opponents, as it is desperately hungry.": "一只{@creature guardian archaeopteryx|ToB3}漫步在海滩上，小心翼翼地在螃蟹壳中搜寻任何剩余的碎屑。这个生物是另一只始祖鸟在{@i Dead Reckoning}（见{@area 2|4.2|u}）上的伴侣，巴雷特希望捕捉它们形成一个繁殖对，然后将后代卖给珍稀生物收藏者。尽管被体型更大的对手包围，它仍然发动攻击，因为它非常饥饿。",

	"A local fisherman unafraid to ply these waters spied the wreck of the ship and came to see what he could salvage. Unfortunately for him, the {@creature beach weird|ToB3} (see {@area 1|4.1|u}) dislodged his boat from the rocks and pushed it out into the deeper water as he made his way ashore. Then he ran afoul of the {@creature talus flow|ToB3} (see {@area 3|4.3|u}) while on the beach. Wounded, he made for the sea cave with a chest he'd found, only to run afoul of one of its inhabitants and met his end there. The fisherman's corpse has been decapitated, and the man's head is currently being snacked on by the cave's occupant.": "一位当地的渔民，不畏惧在这些水域中劳作，发现了这艘船的残骸，并前去看看能够打捞到什么。不幸的是，{@creature beach weird|ToB3} (见{@area 1|4.1|u}) 使他的小船从岩石上脱落，并在他登岸时将其推向更深的水域。然后他在海滩上与{@creature talus flow|ToB3} (见{@area 3|4.3|u}) 发生冲突。受伤的他带着一只发现的箱子朝海洞走去，却与洞穴的居民发生冲突，最终在那里丧命。渔民的尸体已被斩首，他的头目前正在被洞穴的居民啃食。",

	"Beyond the sheet of vines, a wide cavern opens before you. Within, natural rock formations rise up from the cave floor, blocking light and obscuring its true size, making the area feel claustrophobic and small despite its vastness. The entrance continues for 50 feet, leading into a larger chamber from which you can see light filtering out.": "在藤蔓的掩映下，一片宽阔的洞穴展现在你面前。在洞内，天然岩石形成从洞底冉冉升起，挡住了光线，掩盖了它真实的大小，使得这个区域尽管广阔，却让人感到幽闭和狭小。入口延伸了50英尺，通向一个更大的洞室，从那里你可以看到透出的光线。",

	"One {@creature animated armor} and three {@creature clockwork armadillo|ToB3|clockwork armadillos} wait in a hidden alcove that isn't visible from the entrance. Once the PCs move more than 10 feet into the cave, the constructs emerge; PCs with a passive Perception of 14 or lower are surprised.

	"The constructs each engage the nearest PC. They have been ordered to engage nonlethally and to not engage retreating targets, so any PC reduced to 0 hit points is stable. If the PCs retreat or are defeated, the constructs head to Area 2 with any prisoners to show that the hideout has been discovered.": "这些构造体会各自攻击最近的PC。它们被命令以非致命方式进行攻击，并不会攻击正在撤退的目标，因此任何被降至0点生命值的PC都会保持稳定。如果PC们撤退或被击败，这些构造体会带着任何俘虏前往2区，以示这个藏身处已经被发现。",
	"When defeated, the {@creature animated armor} becomes a fully functional suit of {@item plate armor|phb}.

	"The {@creature harvest horse|ToB3} and {@creature clockwork pugilist|ToB3} engage casters and archers first. Mira protects Muhfaz, who heals and supports her with spells. The constructs fight to the death, but Mira and Muhfaz surrender once both are reduced below half of their hit points or if either is reduced below 5 hit points.

	"{@b {@i Gang Prank.}} A group of teens, part of an unnamed, mostly harmless street gang, approaches the PCs, asking for their help in rescuing their friend, Budanyek. Led by his sibling, Rabbit, they explain how they lost their friend; loitering around the old college, daring each other and teasing him with his childhood nickname, Buttanyek. Penniless, Rabbit and the orphans try to appeal to the PCs' good nature as a reward for Budanyek's safe return. Failing that, they share that Budanyek often talked about someday cracking a safe he'd glimpsed inside the college.": "{@b {@i Gang Prank.}} 一群少年，是一个名不见经传、大多无害的街头团伙的一部分，走向PC们，请求他们帮助解救他们的朋友，布丹耶克。由他的兄弟兔子领导，他们解释了他们是如何失去朋友的；在附近的旧学院闲逛，互相挑战，拿他的童年绰号开玩笑，布丹耶克。一贫如洗，兔子和这些孤儿们试图以布丹耶克安全归来作为PC们善良本性的回报。如果失败，他们分享布丹耶克经常谈论有朝一日要破解学院里他瞥见的一个保险箱。",
	"{@b {@i Collector.}} A collector hires the PCs to recover any Heinrosch memorabilia from the college grounds. He knows that much of it has likely been pilfered by bandits, but he hopes that something of interest remains. He offers 50 gp for each piece of Heinrosch memorabilia delivered. He doesn't tell the PCs what his total budget is—because he wants to be able to pick and choose from whatever they find—but he has a soft cap of 300 gp.": "{@b {@i Collector.}} 一个收藏家雇佣PCs从学院校园中找回任何海恩罗施（Heinrosch）的纪念品。他知道很多东西可能已经被土匪偷走了，但他希望还有一些有趣的东西留下来。他为每件交付的海恩罗施纪念品提供50金币。他没有告诉PCs他的总预算是多少—因为他想要能够从他们找到的东西中挑选—但他有一个300金币的软上限。",
	"The college, built more than sixty years ago, is as much a monument to the ambitions and ego of Mikolaj Heinrosch as it is an academy. With wealth earned through years of adventuring, he retired and turned his hand to composing music—and indeed achieved some minor repute in that realm, with a handful of his compositions occasionally (okay, once) mentioned among those of the great composers. Not content with the \"minor\" part of \"minor repute,\" or the fact that he was only once mentioned among the greats, Heinrosch hired gnomish architects and inventors to design an institute that would elevate his bardic legacy. Alas, Heinrosch died before the college ever became successful, and the institution folded abruptly after his demise.": "这所大学建于六十多年前，既是一座纪念米科拉伊·海因罗施（Mikolaj Heinrosch）雄心和自负的纪念碑，也是一所学院。通过多年的冒险赚取财富后，他退休并开始从事音乐创作——在这个领域确实取得了一些小小的声誉，他的一些作品偶尔（好吧，一次）被提及与伟大作曲家之列。海因罗施对“小”声誉这一点并不满足，也不满足于他只有一次被提及于伟大作曲家之列，因此他雇佣了侏儒建筑师和发明家设计了一所学院，旨在提升他作为诗人的遗产。然而，海因罗施在学院取得成功之前去世了，学院在他去世后突然倒闭。",
	"Now, within the college's walls, musical constructs have awakened by Heinrosch's ghost, assisting him while he works towards his goal of completing his unfinished magnum opus.": "现在，在学院的墙内，音乐结构已经被海因罗施的幽灵唤醒，帮助他完成他未完成的杰作(%Heinrosch%)。",
	"The building is clearly abandoned, with all windows boarded up except where otherwise noted. All of the doors have likewise been boarded, but the eastern entrance door is ajar, left so when Budanyek used a crowbar to break inside.": "这座建筑显然被遗弃了，所有窗户都被封上了，除非另有说明。所有的门也被封上了，但东面的入口门是半开着的，布丹耶克用撬棍撬开后就没关上。",
	"The door opens to reveal a vast space with vaulted ceilings that reach 60 feet high. A tattered banner of purple cloth hangs from the ceiling, with yellow stitching spelling out the words \"{@style Welcome Students|small-caps}.\" To the north, a dusty, glass-faced cabinet stands in the gloom. Beyond the cabinet, and around the corner to the north, a long corridor stretches into the dark as the rest of the room to the west continues forward into another large, open area.": "门打开，揭示出一个拱形天花板高达60英尺的广阔空间。一面破旧的紫色布幔从天花板上垂下，上面用黄色线缝着“{@style Welcome Students|small-caps}”这几个字。向北，一个灰尘飘扬的玻璃柜子在昏暗中矗立着。柜子的后面，向北拐角处，一条长廊伸向黑暗，而房间的西侧则继续通向另一个大开阔区域。",
	"This cabinet once held trophies for the school's triumphs and Heinrosch's own accomplishments. Now, it's almost completely empty; the only remaining sign of a trophy is on the top shelf, a brass plaque with the heading \"{@style The Gilded Quill|small-caps}\" in large letters, with the following written below in smaller text: \"{@style The Pen With Which Heinrosch's Symphony No. 3, Oboe Concerto No. 2, and Violin Sonata No. 7 Were Written|small-caps}.\" There is a mounting bracket where an item was clearly once displayed, but there is presently no sign of the quill in question.": "这个橱柜曾经展示过学校的胜利奖杯和海因罗施(Heninrosch)自己的成就。现在，它几乎完全空了；唯一剩下的奖杯迹象是在顶层架上，一个黄铜牌匾上写着大字标题“{@style The Gilded Quill|small-caps}”，下面用小字写着“{@style The Pen With Which Heinrosch's Symphony No. 3, Oboe Concerto No. 2, and Violin Sonata No. 7 Were Written|small-caps}”。有一个安装支架，显然曾经展示过一个物品，但目前看不到所谓的羽毛笔。",
	"Four boarded-up, curtained windows on the south wall allow in slivers of dim light that lance across a disarray of cocktail tables. Opposite the windows, posters depicting bygone performances plaster a wall between three closed doors.": "南墙上有四扇用木板封住、挂着窗帘的窗户，透进来微弱的光线，斜射在一堆鸡尾酒桌上。在窗户的对面，贴满了描绘往昔表演的海报，贴在三扇关闭的门之间的墙上。",
	"Music can be heard coming from inside {@area 10|7.10|u}. A successful DC 11 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) or Charisma ({@skill Performance}) check makes out five distinct sounds coming from the room: four woodwind instruments playing in practiced harmony while a young man's voice fluctuates between cries of pain and frustrated vocalizations. A success that surpasses the DC by 5 or more determines that as the music plays on and off, it subtly changes each time.": "可以听到来自{@area 10|7.10|u}内部的音乐声。成功通过DC 11的感知({@skill Insight})或魅力({@skill Performance})检定可以听出房间里传来的五种不同声音：四种吹管乐器在默契演奏，同时一个年轻男子的声音在痛苦的呼喊和沮丧的发声之间变化。如果检定结果超过DC值5或更多，你会发现随着音乐的播放，每次都会微妙地改变。",
	"Regardless of the skill check result, any creature in this area hears the voice's cries.": "无论技能检定结果如何，在这个区域内的任何生物都会听到声音的哭声。",
	"Heinrosch's influence magically holds shut all six doors leading to {@area 10|7.10|u}. The doors can be opened with a successful DC 23 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check.": "海因罗施的影响以魔法方式将通往{@area 10|7.10|u}的六扇门紧紧关闭。这些门可以通过成功的DC 23 力量检定({@skill Athletics})或智力检定({@skill Arcana})来打开。",
	"For each encounter resolved in {@area Areas 5–8|7.58|x}, reduce the DC by 1. By defeating the {@creature origami golem|ToB3} in {@area 9|7.9|u}, reduce the DC by 3. If all encounters in Areas {@area Areas 5|7.58|x}–{@area 9|7.9|x} are completed, Heinrosch's influence over the Performance Hall is broken, and the doors open normally thereafter.": "每次解决{@area Areas 5–8|7.58|x}中的遭遇，DC减少1。通过在{@area 9|7.9|u}中击败{@creature origami golem|ToB3}，DC减少3。如果完成了{@area Areas 5|7.58|x} - {@area 9|7.9|x}区域中的所有遭遇，那么海恩罗斯对表演大厅的影响将被打破，之后门会正常打开。",
	"Three heavy wooden tables and benches are arrayed here, and light floods the area, shining through the pair of partially boarded windows. A trio of statues are lined up along a wall to the north.": "这里摆放着三张沉重的木桌和长凳，光线洒满整个区域，透过两扇部分封闭的窗户照射进来。三尊雕像排列在北墙上。",
	"The three stone statues—of The Harpist, The Painter, and The Warrior-Poet—depict the three bardic muses; students would lay offerings at the foot of the statues for luck and creative inspiration. Examining the statues reveals that they are in various states of disrepair.": "这三座石像——弹琴者(The Harpist)、画家(The Painter)和武诗人(The Warrior-Poet)——描绘了三位吟游诗人的缪斯；学生们会在石像脚下献上祭品，祈求好运和创作灵感。仔细观察这些石像会发现它们都有不同程度的损坏。",
	"A successful DC 13 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check notes the following: All of The Harpist's strings have snapped; The Painter's easel holds no canvas; and The Warrior-Poet holds a quill made of stone in one hand, poised as if to write something in a book held in his other hand, but his other hand is empty. There are bits of broken string still attached to the harp, indicating that some elements of the statues were originally not stone.": "一次成功的智力检定（{@skill Investigation}）DC 13 注意到以下情况：The Harpist的所有琴弦都断了；The Painter的画架上没有画布；而The Warrior-Poet手持一支石头制成的羽毛笔，另一只手拿着一本书，仿佛要写点什么，但另一只手是空的。琴上还残留着一些断裂的琴弦，表明雕像的一些元素最初并非石头制成。",
	"The intent of the statues being only partially stone was so that the students could interact with them—play a song on The Harpist's instrument, place a painting on The Painter's easel, or add a poem to The Warrior-Poet's book.": "雕像只有部分是石头的意图是让学生们可以与它们互动——在( The Harpist )的乐器上演奏一首歌曲，在( The Painter )的画架上放一幅画，或者在( The Warrior-Poet )的书上添加一首诗。",
	"If all three statues are repaired, the muses offer a blessing. Any creature that assisted at all in the repair has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma ability checks for the next eight hours.": "如果三尊雕像都被修复，缪斯女神会给予祝福。在接下来的八小时内，任何协助修复的生物在智力、感知和魅力属性检定中获得优势。",

A black safe looms in the corner.": "在这个装饰豪华的办公室里，厚厚的灰尘覆盖着每一个表面。西墙上的窗户透进柔和的光线，窗格中的一道裂缝让微风飘动着摆在一张漂亮书桌上的发黄文具。墙上挂着描绘英勇事迹的画作，光线反射在书桌后墙壁上挂着的篮形护手剑上。一个黑色的保险箱矗立在角落里。",

	"A nameplate on the desk reads \"{@style Dean Heinrosch|small-caps}.\" While searching the desk, a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check discovers a drawer with a false bottom. If the check surpasses the DC by 5 or more, it also reveals that the drawer is trapped; if it doesn't, and the PC specifically looks for traps, a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) detects it. A successful DC 13 Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|phb} disarms the trap. Failure to disarm the trap triggers a small poisoned needle when the false bottom is accessed, forcing one creature interacting with the drawer to make a DC 13 Constitution save. The creature takes 2 piercing damage and 16 ({@damage 3d10}) poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.": "桌子上的一个名牌上写着“{@style Dean Heinrosch|small-caps}”。在搜查桌子时，如果一次成功的智力检定（DC 10，{@skill Investigation}）发现了一个带有假底的抽屉。如果检定结果超过DC值5或更多，还会发现这个抽屉被设置了陷阱；如果没有超过DC值，而玩家角色专门寻找陷阱，一次成功的感知检定（DC 15，{@skill Perception}）可以察觉到。一次成功的敏捷检定（DC 13，使用{@item thieves' tools|phb}）可以解除陷阱。解除陷阱失败会触发一个小型毒针，当打开假底时，与抽屉互动的生物需要进行一次体质豁免检定（DC 13）。生物在豁免失败时会受到2点穿刺伤害和16点({@damage 3d10})毒素伤害，豁免成功时则只受到一半伤害。",

	"A combination lock secures the safe; it has three rotating dials, each numbered 0-9. The code is 3, 2, 7—the numbers of Heinrosch's three best-regarded compositions; a clue to both the numbers and the order in which they appear in the combination can be found in the display cabinet in {@area 1|7.1|u}.

As the PCs speak to him, the {@creature ghost} maintains perfect control over Budanyek's movement and actions, though the boy still intermittently wrests back control of his own body to cry out in pain before Heinrosch regains control.": "Heinrosch（海因罗施）着迷于完成他的杰作，一首在他去世前未完成的终曲。当PCs与他交谈时，{@creature ghost}对Budanyek（布丹耶克）的动作和行为保持完美控制，尽管男孩偶尔还会夺回自己身体的控制权，发出痛苦的呼喊，然后Heinrosch重新控制住他。",
	"If the PCs question Heinrosch, other than his work, he doesn't remember anything they might ask about, such as how, when, or how long ago he died. If they ask about anything else, he angrily shouts that he doesn't have time for idle chatter, but he's willing to listen to anything the PCs offer that might help him finish his opus.": "如果PC们询问海因罗施，除了他的工作之外，他对他们可能问到的任何事情都没有记忆，比如他是如何死的，死于何时，或者多久以前死的。如果他们问及其他事情，他会愤怒地大喊说他没有时间闲聊，但他愿意倾听PC们提供的任何可能帮助他完成作品的建议。",
	"Here are three likely scenarios via which the PCs can resolve the situation:": "以下是三种PCs可能解决情况的情景：",
	"{@b {@i Have a PC Finish It.}} Heinrosch can be convinced to relinquish control of Budanyek if a PC offers to be possessed instead; Heinrosch only agrees if the PC has a {@skill Performance} modifier of 3 or higher, or with a successful DC 17 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check (made with advantage if the PC is wearing Heinrosch's iconic hat found in {@area 4|7.4|u}). If the PCs choose this option, Heinrosch's {@creature ghost} leaves Budanyek, possesses the PC, and immediately returns to his work. The possessed PC requires {@dice 2d8+2} hours to finish Heinrosch's work. The PC must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw each hour; if they fail three times, they suffer a level of {@condition exhaustion} and then suffer an additional level each additional failure.": "{@b {@i Have a PC Finish It.}} 如果一个玩家角色提出代替被占据，海因罗施可以被说服放弃对布丹耶克的控制；海因罗施只会同意如果玩家角色的{@skill Performance}修改值为3或更高，或者通过一次成功的DC 17魅力检定（如果玩家角色戴着海因罗施在{@area 4|7.4|u}找到的标志性帽子则带有优势）。如果玩家角色选择这个选项，海因罗施的{@creature ghost}离开布丹耶克，占据玩家角色，并立即返回工作。被占据的玩家角色需要{@dice 2d8+2}小时来完成海因罗施的工作。玩家角色必须每小时进行一次DC 10体质豁免检定；如果连续失败三次，他们将受到一级{@condition exhaustion}，然后每次额外失败都会受到一级。",
	"{@b {@i Let Budanyek Finish It.}} Heinrosch wishes to keep possessing Budanyek until his work is finished. If the PCs choose this option, it takes Heinrosch {@dice 1d8+1} hours to finish his work; this process requires Budanyek to succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw every hour or else suffer a level of {@condition exhaustion}. This could very easily end with Budanyek's death without intervention, as the teen is a {@creature commoner} who is already suffering from three levels of {@condition exhaustion} due to the rigors he has already endured. The PCs are free to assist Budanyek however they wish, whether it's via the {@action Help} action and/or spells or other means; allow a player's creative thinking to be beneficial to this process regardless of normal game mechanics.": "{@b {@i Let Budanyek Finish It.}）海因罗施希望在完成工作之前继续控制布丹耶克。如果玩家选择这个选项，海因罗施需要{@dice 1d8+1}小时来完成他的工作；这个过程要求布丹耶克每小时成功通过一次 DC 13 的体质豁免才能避免受到一级{@condition exhaustion}。如果没有干预，这很容易导致布丹耶克死亡，因为这位少年已经因为所遭受的严酷折磨而患有三级{@condition exhaustion}。玩家可以自由选择以任何方式帮助布丹耶克，无论是通过{@action Help}行动、法术或其他方法；允许玩家的创造性思维对这个过程有益，而不受正常游戏机制的限制。",
	"{@b {@i Stop the Ghost.}} The PCs can choose to exorcise the {@creature ghost} from Budanyek's body, via the means detailed in the {@creature ghost||ghost's} Possession ability. Choosing this action always results in combat as the {@creature animated quartet|ToB3} quickly moves to defend the {@creature ghost}, fighting until it is destroyed. Because Budanyek is in no shape to fight and Heinrosch is obsessed with his legacy, Heinrosch only takes the {@action Dodge} action in the hopes of finishing the sonata amid the fracas.": "{@b {@i Stop the Ghost.}} 玩家可以选择通过{@creature ghost||ghost's}的附身能力中详细描述的方式，从Budanyek的身体中驱逐{@creature ghost}。选择这个行动总是会导致战斗，因为{@creature animated quartet|ToB3}会迅速移动来保护{@creature ghost}，直到它被摧毁。由于Budanyek没有战斗能力，Heinrosch痴迷于他的遗产，所以他只会采取{@action Dodge}的行动，希望在混战中完成奏鸣曲。",
	"Heinrosch/Budanyek holds \"The Gilded Quill\" pen (see {@area 1|7.1|u}). It's worth 10 gp purely for the novelty of it being a gold quill, but a savvy negotiator might be able to get someone to pay up to 25 gp for it as a curiosity if they tell the tale of Heinrosch or invent a compelling fiction.": "海因罗施/布丹耶克拥有“镀金羽毛笔”(见{@area 1|7.1|u})。这支笔价值10 gp，纯粹因为它是一支金色羽毛笔，但一个精明的谈判者可能会通过讲述海因罗施的故事或编造一个引人入胜的虚构故事，说服别人支付高达25 gp 的价格作为一件珍品。",

	"Middling. It's . . . fine? Children who are just learning to play their instruments seem to enjoy performing it.": "一般般。这个……还行吧？刚开始学习演奏乐器的孩子们似乎很喜欢表演它。",
	"Good. A work that will likely find great appreciation among the masses, but often does not excite an expert's ear. Heinrosch's previous \"masterworks\" were of this level.": "好。这样的作品很可能会受到大众的欣赏，但往往不会激发专家的兴趣。海因罗施(Heinrosch)之前的“杰作”就是这个水平。",
	"Incredible. A masterpiece that will surely be remembered forever.": "令人难以置信。这将是一部永远被铭记的杰作。",
	"Astounding. A work of unsurpassed genius that only one-in-a-million composers could even attempt.": "令人震撼。这是一项无与伦比的天才之作，只有百万分之一的作曲家才能尝试。",

	"If Budanyek is not saved, the PCs find his gang waiting outside when they leave the college. They're heartbroken at the news (explaining who they are to the PCs if they haven't met before). If the PCs brokered a deal with the gang, the teens now refuse to fulfill their end of any bargain, citing Budanyek's death as a deal-breaker. Resentful of the PCs' failure, Rabbit and the gang disparage the PCs in whatever locale they're going to next; while in that city/town, the PCs have disadvantage on any Charisma ability checks until they can repair their reputation.": "如果Budanyek没有被拯救，PCs在离开学院时会发现他的帮派正在外面等候。他们听到这个消息后感到心碎（如果他们之前没有见过PCs，会向PCs解释他们是谁）。如果PCs与帮派达成了交易，那些青少年现在会拒绝履行他们任何交易的承诺，以Budanyek的死亡作为破坏交易的理由。对PCs的失败心存怨恨，Rabbit和帮派会在PCs前往下一个地点时贬低PCs；在那个城市/镇上，PCs在修复声誉之前在任何魅力技能检定上都具有劣势。",
	"If Budanyek is saved, he gets halfway through offering his thanks before fainting from exhaustion. Budanyek's gang waits just outside the college and are beside themselves with joy when they're reunited with their friend (perhaps confusing the PCs if they haven't met before); they gladly pay any reward that was agreed to. If the PCs refuse the reward (or never asked for one in the first place), Rabbit and the gang talk up the PCs in whatever locale they're going to next; while in that city/town, the PCs have advantage on any Charisma ability checks for one week.": "如果布达涅克(Budanyek)被拯救，他在感谢一半时因筋疲力尽而晕倒。布达涅克的团伙就在学院外等候，当他们与朋友团聚时欣喜若狂（如果之前未曾见过PCs，可能会让PCs感到困惑）；他们乐意支付任何事先达成的奖励。如果PCs拒绝奖励（或者一开始就没有要求奖励），兔子(Rabbit)和团伙会在下一个目的地大肆宣扬PCs的好处；在那个城镇/城市，PCs在一周内对任何魅力检定获得优势。",
	"If Heinrosch completes his final composition and the result on the \"Magnum Opus?\" table is 15–24, Heinrosch is thrilled and asks the PCs to give it an impressive title and share it with the world. If the result is 25 or higher, Heinrosch reacts the same as above, but afterward breaks down, weeping with joy and whispering, {@i \"I've done it. I've truly done it.\"} The {@creature ghost} then fades into the afterlife and disappears for good. If the PCs do share the composition with the world, and the result is 25 or higher, they hear it being played any time such music might be played, such as at royal's or noble's party.": "如果海因罗施完成了他的最终作品，而在“杰作魔术表”上的结果是15-24，海因罗施会感到兴奋，并请玩家角色给它取一个令人印象深刻的标题，并与世界分享。如果结果是25或更高，海因罗施会做出与上述相同的反应，但之后会崩溃，欣喜若狂地哭泣并低语，{@i \"I've done it. I've truly done it.\"}。然后，{@creature ghost}消失进入来世，永远消失。如果玩家角色将作品与世界分享，且结果为25或更高，他们会在任何可能播放这种音乐的场合听到它被演奏，比如在皇室或贵族的聚会上。",

As he continues muttering, before long, he fades away into the afterlife and disappears for good—{@i or so the PCs think}. Heinrosch is enraged at the failure to cement his legacy and, in the future, seeks revenge on the PCs, possessing the leader of a group of bandits that comes to the college to loot whatever isn't nailed down; in this new warrior body, Heinrosch bides his time, striking when it's most opportune, with the goal of possessing either the PC that he previously possessed or the PC with the highest {@skill Performance} modifier.": "如果海因罗施完成了他的最终作品，并且“Magnum Opus?”表的结果为14或更低，海因罗施起初会愤怒地称PCs为无能之辈，但很快就会变得忧郁，悲叹自己的遗产。当他继续喃喃自语时，不久之后，他就会消失在来世中，永远消失—{@i or so the PCs think}。 海因罗施对未能巩固自己的遗产感到愤怒，并在未来寻求对PCs的报复，占据了一群强盗的领袖的身体，他们来到学院掠夺任何没有被钉牢的东西；在这个新的战士身体中，海因罗施等待时机，最有利时发动攻击，目标是占据之前占据过的PC或具有最高{@skill Performance}修改值的PC。",

Unless otherwise noted, all doors—including the front door—are wooden and unlocked. The barndoors are both barred from the inside, requiring a successful DC 18 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to break them open.": "除了一个大门外，房子的东侧和西侧各有一扇15英尺宽的谷仓门，位于建筑物的后部。除非另有说明，所有门，包括前门，在翻译中仍然是木制的并且没有锁。谷仓门都是从内部用横杆锁住的，需要成功进行一次DC 18力量检定({@skill Athletics})才能打开它们。",
	"There are two heavy iron portcullis in {@area 5|16.5|u}. Each has AC 19, 27 hit points, and a damage threshold of 10, but the margrave gladly orders the gate opened if the PCs wish to enter the arena.": "{@area 5|16.5|u}里有两扇沉重的铁闸门。每扇闸门的防御等级为19，27生命值，并且有10的伤害阈值，但如果PC们希望进入竞技场，边境伯爵会乐意下令打开大门。",

	"Margrave Millard (NE human {@creature druid}) is a tall, pale man in his early 30s. He dresses in baggy formalwear that hangs off his frame, giving him the impression of being far scrawnier than he actually is. He's always been obsessed with physical strength and the freedom and respect he believes it can provide. He also really likes to hear himself talk, which is the foundation of his friendship with the stubbornly quiet Researcher Voss (NE human {@creature priest}).": "Millard边境侯爵（NE 人类{@creature druid}）是一个三十多岁的高个、苍白的男人。他穿着宽松的正装，让他看起来比实际上更瘦弱。他一直痴迷于体力和他认为体力可以带来的自由和尊重。他也非常喜欢听自己说话，这是他与固执沉默的研究员沃斯（NE 人类{@creature priest}）友谊的基础。",
	"While Millard is well-educated and is keen to justify himself with philosophical diatribes about the fundamental meaninglessness of life and the purity of a natural life, he's utterly uninterested in what others have to say. Allies have their words interpreted as supporting him, and everyone else is casually dismissed as worthless.": "虽然米拉德（Millard）受过良好教育，热衷于用哲学长篇演讲来证明生活的根本无意义和自然生活的纯洁，但他对他人的观点完全不感兴趣。盟友的话被解释为支持他，而其他人则被轻蔑地视为无足轻重。",
	"Millard can speak to anyone in his manor, no matter what room they're in, via the enchanted pyramidal stone in {@area 9|16.9|u}; it's one-way communication only, so he can't hear any reply.

He can also see what his guests are doing, but only in {@area 1|16.1|u}, via the enchanted spectacles in {@area 9|16.9|u}.": "Millard可以通过他庄园中的附魔金字塔石{@area 9|16.9|u}与任何人交流，无论对方在哪个房间；这种交流是单向的，所以他听不到任何回复。边境伯爵利用这个机会，在客人探索庄园时对他们自言自语。他还可以通过庄园中的附魔眼镜{@area 9|16.9|u}在{@area 1|16.1|u}看到客人在做什么。",
	"This extravagant foyer may once have been luxurious, but now it's best described as eerie. Half the candles on the chandelier are unlit, casting the room in dim, unpleasant light, while the once-gleaming hardwood floors are now marred with overlapping scratch and claw marks. Two threadbare chairs (with their cushions missing) flank the entryway. Directly ahead there's a door to the north with a large, sneering face carved into the wall above it.": "这个奢华的门厅曾经可能是豪华的，但现在最好描述为诡异。枝形吊灯上一半的蜡烛未点亮，使房间充斥着昏暗而令人不快的光线，而曾经闪亮的硬木地板现在被重叠的划痕和爪痕玷污。两把破旧的椅子（缺少靠垫）夹在入口处。正前方有一扇朝北的门，门上方雕刻着一个大而冷笑的脸。",
	"Margrave Millard watches the entrance hall, using a pair of enchanted spectacles (see {@area 9|16.9|u}) to look through the eyes of the sneering face above the door. When he spots the PCs, he introduces himself, his voice reverberating all around the PCs, as if coming from the house itself. He thanks them for volunteering as his final test subjects, then urges them to step through the door to the north, so that the demonstration can begin. He calls them cowards if they go through any other door.": "马格雷夫·米拉德（Margrave Millard）注视着入口大厅，使用一副附魔眼镜（见{@area 9|16.9|u}）透过门上那张嘲笑的脸的眼睛观察。当他发现冒险者时，他向他们介绍自己，他的声音在冒险者周围回荡，仿佛是房子本身发出的。他感谢他们自愿成为他的最后测试对象，然后敦促他们穿过北边的门，以便演示开始。如果他们选择其他门，他会称呼他们为懦夫。",
	"This plain room hosts three bunks, each with a pair of small wooden chests at its foot. A polished wooden table sits in the center of the room, with several chairs and stools arranged around it.

	"This long, narrow room expands into a small alcove at its northern end, where you can see shreds of half-eaten flesh and fragments of bone scattered. Wooden cages are pressed against the walls here and wherever else there is space, and the area reeks of rotting meat and the acrid stench of a spilled alchemical reagents. This looks as if it might have once have been a kitchen, as you see a chimney and oven against the outer wall, next to it a water basin, and to the northeast a counter—now dedicated to what must be monster food—that may once have been used for food preparation. A barndoor on the western wall, which is barred on this side, appears to lead outside the manse.": "这个狭长的房间朝北端扩展成一个小壁龛，那里散落着被咬过的肉和碎骨的残片。木笼子紧贴着墙壁，填满了每一寸空间，整个区域弥漫着腐烂肉和被泼洒的炼金药剂的刺鼻气味。这看起来曾经是一个厨房，因为你看到外墙上有一个烟囱和烤炉，旁边是一个水盆，东北方向有一个柜台——现在被用来放怪物食物，可能曾经用来准备食物。西墙上的谷仓门在这一侧上了门闩，似乎通向别墅外面。",

	"Centuries ago, the {@creature red greatwyrm|FTD|great wyrm red dragon} Soriantathalga laired in the heart of Mount Sagur.

	"A small caldera formed where Mount Sagur had been. Only about 100 feet in diameter, it has been little more than a blasted pit for centuries; meanwhile, Mount Magra has remained dormant.": "在萨古尔山(Mount Sagur)原本的地方形成了一个小火山口。直径只有约100英尺，几个世纪以来它一直只是一个被炸出来的坑洞；与此同时，玛格拉山(Mount Magra)一直处于休眠状态。",
	"In the aftermath of the cataclysm, the plains to the west of Mount Magra and the Sagur caldera became incredibly fertile. Over time, plants grew again in the ground and people settled there, founding villages and cultivating farmland. The closest village is Dorma, about 5 miles away, situated on a burbling stream fed by mountain springs.": "在大灾变之后，麦格拉山西部和萨古尔火山口附近的平原变得异常肥沃。随着时间的推移，植物再次在土地上生长，人们在那里定居，建立村庄并耕种农田。最近的村庄是多玛(%num%)，距离大约5英里，坐落在由山泉供水的潺潺小溪旁。",

	"Upon learning of this, Ferriahn Colvane—a cleric of Volund, god of earth and fire—went to investigate. She inspected the caldera and its surroundings, finding no sign of volcanic activity in the caldera or Mount Magra, nor did she find any creatures, though she did find some scorched trees. Unsatisfied but out of leads, Ferriahn returned to the village to research and await further developments. After hearing more of the same from the farmers, she returned to investigate again only to discover that the caldera was bubbling with magma and Mount Magra was leaking toxic volcanic gas. Using her magic and knowledge gained by her lifelong study of volcanoes, Ferriahn sensed a planar rift in the magma of the caldera and that it was somehow causing its twin volcano to become unstable. Troubled, she returned to Dorma after narrowly escaping an encounter with a {@creature fire elemental}.": "得知这一情况后，Ferriahn Colvane——沃伦德（Volund）神（地火之神）的一名神职人员——前往调查。她检查了火山口及其周围，未发现火山口或玛格拉山（Mount Magra）有任何火山活动的迹象，也没有发现任何生物，尽管她发现了一些被烧焦的树木。虽然不满意但没有线索，Ferriahn返回村庄进行研究，等待进一步的发展。在听到农民们再次提到同样的情况后，她再次返回进行调查，却发现火山口正在冒着岩浆，而玛格拉山正在泄漏有毒的火山气体。利用她的魔法和对火山的终身研究所获得的知识，Ferriahn感知到火山口中存在一个位面裂隙，而这个裂隙在某种方式上导致了它的孪生火山变得不稳定。深感忧虑，她在与一只{@creature fire elemental}擦肩而过后侥幸逃脱，便返回了Dorma。",
	"After some research and prayer, Ferriahn determined that the rift was unstable, and that it's likely that if a certain amount of explosive energy—fire, lightning, thunder, or force—is used in the caldera, it may cause Mount Magra to erupt. Using the {@spell scrying} spell, she observed fiends, dragons, and elementals emerging from the rift, any of which could employ such explosive energies. She believes the planar rift will remain open as long as any of the creatures that came through it survive or remain on this plane—and that closing the rift will render the volcano and caldera dormant once again. If that is not done, she fears the volcano will erupt, causing incredible devastation.": "经过一番研究和祈祷，费里安（Ferriahn）确定裂隙不稳定，如果在火山口使用一定量的爆炸能量——火、闪电、雷鸣或力量——很可能会导致玛格拉山（Mount Magra）爆发。使用{@spell scrying}法术，她观察到从裂隙中涌出恶魔、龙和元素生物，它们中的任何一种都可能使用这种爆炸性能量。她相信只要通过裂隙的生物中有任何一种存活或留在这个位面上，那么位面裂隙将保持开放状态，而关闭裂隙将使火山和火山口再次休眠。如果不这样做，她担心火山将爆发，造成难以想象的破坏。",
	"{@b {@i Hired Heroes.}} Ferriahn met the PCs once and has heard much of their accomplishments since.

	"If the PCs fought one of the creatures on the way to the caldera, but drove it off rather than killing it, that creature (at full health) could appear on a roll of a 10 instead of gating a new creature in.": "如果角色在前往火山口的路上与其中一只生物战斗，但是将其赶走而不是杀死，那只生物（全血）可能会在掷出10的情况下出现，而不是召唤一个新的生物。",
	"Also, if all other creatures are slain, a creature the PCs drove off on their way automatically shows up. It's possible the PCs forgot about this creature, leading them to wonder why the volcano is still spouting gases, still ready to explode. But they won't have long to wonder as the previously repelled creature shows up in {@dice 1d6} rounds.": "此外，如果所有其他生物都被杀死，PCs在途中赶走的生物会自动出现。PCs可能忘记了这个生物，让他们想知道为什么火山仍在喷发气体，仍然准备爆炸。但他们不会有太多时间去思考，因为先前被击退的生物会在{@dice 1d6}回合后出现。",
	"If the PCs leave the caldera, the creatures within follow them, except for the {@creature obsidian ophidian|ToB3}. This is a sound strategy because taking the fight outside the caldera gives them more room to spread out, potentially dividing and conquering their foes. In addition, any energy effects they use outside the caldera that deal fire, lightning, thunder, or force damage do not further destabilize the volcano. Finally, the PCs are not vulnerable to the harmful gases of the caldera while outside it.": "如果PCs离开火山口，其中的生物会跟随他们，除了{@creature obsidian ophidian|ToB3}。这是一个明智的策略，因为将战斗带到火山口外会给他们更多的空间来展开，有可能分散并征服他们的敌人。此外，他们在火山口外使用的任何造成火焰、闪电、雷霆或力场伤害的能量效果不会进一步使火山不稳定。最后，在火山口外，PCs不会受到火山口有害气体的影响。",
	"It's important to remember that most of these creatures are not particularly intelligent and probably don't like each other. If another creature gets in a monster's way or harms them, they have no compunctions about attacking that creature. They also take {@action opportunity attack||opportunity attacks} against any creature that leaves their reach, except creatures of their same kind.": "重要的是要记住，这些生物大多数并不特别聪明，可能彼此并不喜欢。如果另一个生物挡住了怪物的路或伤害了它们，它们会毫不犹豫地攻击那个生物。它们还会对任何离开它们攻击范围的生物采取{@action opportunity attack||opportunity attacks}，除了同类生物。",
	"The encounter at the caldera can prove extremely deadly depending on the encounter table results. Here are some ways to reduce the threat level, should you feel the battle has become too lethal.": "在火山口的遭遇可能会因遭遇表结果而变得极其致命。以下是一些降低威胁级别的方法，如果你觉得战斗变得过于致命的话。",
	"If you roll a 10 on the encounter table during the battle, simply ignore it.": "如果在战斗中在遭遇表上掷出了10，只需忽略它。",
	"Have the creatures kill each other. Do this sparingly, but the creatures present might gang up on one of the other creatures. Or it could be that two of the creatures particularly hate each other.": "让生物互相残杀。请谨慎使用此情节，但在场的生物可能会联合起来攻击另一个生物。或者可能是其中两只生物特别仇恨彼此。",
	"Make the volcanic eruption require more damage to trigger it.": "使火山喷发需要更多的伤害才能触发它。",
	"Give the PCs a hint, suggesting they might benefit considerably from drawing the battle away from the caldera. This is particularly reasonable if a PC has the {@skill History} skill or a military or tactical background.": "给玩家一个提示，建议他们将战斗从火山口处引开可能会有很大好处。如果有玩家拥有{@skill History}技能或军事或战术背景，这个建议尤其合理。",
	"If, however, the encounter proves too easy, here are some ways to amp up the difficulty:": "然而，如果遭遇证明太容易了，这里有一些方法来增加难度：",
	"Change the die you roll on the encounter table to determine if there's an encounter from a {@dice d10} to a {@dice d8}, or lower the die size by one step each round: {@dice d10}, {@dice d8}, {@dice d6}, {@dice d4}, {@dice d2}. You would still roll a {@dice d10} to determine which creature appears.": "将用于确定是否有遭遇的遭遇表骰子从{@dice d10}改为{@dice d8}，或每轮将骰子大小降低一步：{@dice d10}，{@dice d8}，{@dice d6}，{@dice d4}，{@dice d2}。你仍然会投掷一个{@dice d10}来确定出现哪种生物。",
	"Instead of rolling on the encounter table, pick one of the higher CR options.": "不要在遭遇表上掷骰子，选择其中一个更高的CR选项。",
	"Once the PCs have killed or otherwise removed all the creatures in the caldera from this plane, the planar rift closes and the volcanic threat is no more. Ferriahn thanks them profusely, gladly handing over any promised reward.": "一旦PCs消灭或以其他方式将火山口中的所有生物从这个位面移除，位面裂缝就会关闭，火山威胁也就消失了。Ferriahn非常感谢他们，乐意交出任何承诺的奖励。",
	"The PCs have no time to explore the mountain during the adventure, but they may do so afterward. Mount Magra is not detailed here, but if the PCs go there they might encounter more of the creatures described in this adventure. They may find the corpses of the ancient heroes and any treasure they had on them. They might also find the bones of the ancient dragon and possibly its hoard. There might even be a new dragon lairing there, attracted by the brief awakening of the volcano.": "在冒险中，角色们没有时间探索(`Mount Magra`)，但之后他们可以这样做。(`Mount Magra`)在这里没有详细描述，但如果角色们前往那里，他们可能会遇到更多在这次冒险中描述的生物。他们可能会发现古代英雄的尸体和他们身上携带的任何宝藏。他们还可能会找到古代龙的骨骼，甚至可能是它的藏宝。甚至可能会有一只新的龙在那里筑巢，被火山的短暂苏醒所吸引。",
	"The Eclipse of the Sun Chapel is a legend shared across generations. In the story, a priesthood devoted to the sun god Khors (see {@i Midgard Worldbook}, or use another god of the sun or light appropriate to your setting) lost their home when ooze cultists attacked during an auspicious solar eclipse. The cult defiled the chapel, creating a planar gate from which oozing horrors spilled forth. Amidst the massacre, a cleric sacrificed themself to seal the portal and block part of the chapel with a magical wall, but the damage was done and the chapel was lost.": "太阳教堂日食堂是代代相传的传奇。在故事中，一个致力于太阳神Khors（见{@i Midgard Worldbook}，或者使用另一个适合你设定的太阳或光之神）的神职团体，在一次吉兆的日食期间，遭到了软泥教徒的袭击，失去了他们的家园。邪教徒亵渎了教堂，创造了一个位面之门，从中涌出了软泥恐怖。在屠杀中，一位神职人员牺牲自己，封印了传送门，并用魔法墙封住了教堂的一部分，但伤害已经造成，教堂已经失落。",
	"Now, a third-generation painter named Pol is visited by an angel who shows him visions of his ancestor at the chapel's fall. The angel then anoints Pol, blessing him with divine authority and proclaiming him an apostle—chosen to reconsecrate the chapel through the working of a miracle. As outlandish as this may seem, Pol accepts his charge with conviction and sets forth on his quest.": "现在，一位名叫波尔（Pol）的第三代画家被一位天使所访，天使向他展示了他祖先在教堂倒塌时的景象。然后，天使膏抹了波尔，赐予他神圣的权威，并宣称他是被选中通过奇迹的工作来重新祝圣教堂的使徒。尽管这看起来荒谬，波尔却坚定地接受了这个使命，并踏上了他的探索之旅。",
	"Pol (CG human {@creature apostle|ToB3}), who works miracles through his art, is guided by visions to seek out the PCs and ask for their help. He has nothing with which to pay the PCs, but claims they have been—like he himself—chosen to save the lost chapel. If the PCs demand payment, Pol reluctantly offers them his painting studio, a property in a mountainside town worth approximately 8,000 gp.": "波尔（{@creature apostle|ToB3}人类（CG）），通过他的艺术创造奇迹，被幻象引导着寻找PC，并请求他们的帮助。他没有任何东西可以用来支付PC，但声称他们像他自己一样，被选中拯救失落的教堂。如果PC要求支付，波尔勉强提供他的画室，这是位于山腰小镇的一处价值约8000金币的财产。",
	"When the PCs agree to help, Pol takes them to where he has a horse-drawn cart laden with supplies and declares he is ready to set forth. The ensuing trek takes Pol and the party six days through mountainous terrain before finally reaching the chapel. Complications during the trek are minimal. Pol always seems to know where to go to avoid danger or hostile creatures. When asked about his prescience, Pol simply responds with \"I had a vision.\"": "当玩家角色同意帮助时，波尔带他们去了一个装满补给的马车那里，并宣布他已经准备好出发。接下来的徒步旅行中，波尔和队伍穿越了六天的山地地形，最终抵达了教堂。在徒步旅行中的复杂情况很少。波尔似乎总是知道去哪里以避开危险或敌对生物。当被问及他的先知能力时，波尔简单地回答说：“我有一个预见。”",
	"The Chapel of the Sun faces east on a mountaintop overlooking Pol's hometown. The chapel was built to observe the rising sun and, with its brilliant stained glass windows, was a shining beacon for travelers. The mountain range around the chapel grew rich with alpine berries and flowers which the priests used to make dyes and pigments for blessed works of art.": "太阳教堂坐落在一个山顶上，面朝东方，俯瞰着波尔的故乡。这座教堂是为了观赏日出而建的，它那华丽的彩色玻璃窗成为了旅行者的明亮灯塔。教堂周围的山脉长满了高山浆果和鲜花，神父们用它们制作染料和颜料，用于创作受祝福的艺术品。",
	"Pol and the PCs arrive first thing in the morning, just as the sun is rising behind the chapel.": "波尔和玩家角色们一大早就到达了，就在太阳从教堂后升起的时候。",
	"Upon arriving at the chapel, Pol leads the PCs directly to {@area 3|20.3|u}, so he can immediately begin his work. He is certain—thanks to his visions—that the nave doesn't contain any creatures, traps, or hazards inside it, and, unwilling to waste any time, he is unwilling to wait for the PCs to clear any rooms. He goes directly to the altar and starts his work on his miracle.": "抵达教堂后，波尔直接带领玩家角色们直奔{@area 3|20.3|u}，这样他就可以立即开始他的工作。由于他的预见，他确信中殳内部没有任何生物、陷阱或危险物品，他不愿浪费任何时间，也不愿等待玩家角色们清理任何房间。他直接走向祭坛，开始他的奇迹工作。",
	"After surveying the nave for several minutes, Pol explains that he will paint a great mural on the wall behind the altar. It will be a triptych, he says, and points out the three central sections of wall between the window panes that he intends to use as his canvas. He believes that the act of observing affects the act of creation, so, through prayer, he learned a subtle magic that he uses to obscure his works until they're finished. Thus, as he paints, the PCs cannot see what he's creating. He insists that he will reveal the work only when it is complete.": "在仔细调查了圣坛前的航海图后，波尔解释说他将在圣坛后面的墙上绘制一幅伟大的壁画。他说这将是一幅三联画，并指出他打算用作画布的三个窗玻璃之间的墙壁的中央部分。他相信观察的行为会影响创作的行为，因此，通过祈祷，他学会了一种微妙的魔法，用来隐藏他的作品，直到完成为止。因此，在他绘画时，玩家角色无法看到他在创作什么。他坚持只有在作品完成后才会揭示出来。",
	"When the cultists attacked the chapel, they ravaged the area; they burned the fields, razed the rectories to the ground, destroyed precious artworks and sacred relics, and smeared slime and ooze into the priests' sacred pigments.": "当异教徒袭击教堂时，他们肆虐了整个区域；他们烧毁了田地，将牧师住宅夷为平地，摧毁了珍贵的艺术品和神圣的遗物，并将粘液和污泥涂抹在牧师们的神圣颜料上。",
	"The chapel's desecration causes the following effects:": "教堂的亵渎会导致以下效果：",
	"Any creature that doesn't have the elemental, fiend, ooze, or undead type is prevented from traveling within 100 feet of the chapel by teleportation or extradimensional/interplanar means, though short-range teleportation within the grounds, such as via {@spell misty step}, still works.": "任何没有元素、恶魔、软泥怪或不死生物类型的生物，都无法通过传送或超维/外位手段在100英尺内进入教堂，尽管在场地内的短程传送，比如通过{@spell misty step}，仍然有效。",
	"While on the chapel grounds, whenever a creature's hit points are restored by healing magic, the number of hit points restored is halved. (Hit dice recovery is unaffected.)": "在教堂的院子里，每当一个生物通过治疗魔法恢复生命值时，恢复的生命值数量减半。 (命中骰恢复不受影响。)",
	"Plants cannot grow without magical means within 1 mile of the chapel.": "在教堂周围1英里范围内，植物不能在没有魔法手段的情况下生长。",
	"The ceiling of the nave reaches 60 feet in height while all the rest of the ceilings in the chapel are 15 feet high.": "中殿的天花板高达60英尺，而教堂其他部分的天花板都是15英尺高。",
	"Gobs of ooze, thick with grit, coat most of this vestibule's walls. A table with a crushed alms box stands against the north wall. Opposite a set of ornate double doors is a shallow alcove, grime and muck obscuring it almost entirely.": "大量的软泥，夹杂着颗粒，覆盖了这个门厅的大部分墙壁。一张有着被压碎的乞讨箱的桌子靠着北墙。在对面的一对华丽的双门前是一个浅凹室，被污垢和泥淤几乎完全遮盖住了。",
	"In addition to the double doors, there's also a single door on the western wall.": "除了双扇门外，西墙上还有一扇单扇门。",
	"In the alcove on the southern wall is a mural, though it is nearly completely hidden behind layers of grime and muck. A pair of small windows shine down from above the mural—or would if they too weren't entirely obscured.": "在南墙的壁龛里有一幅壁画，尽管它几乎完全被厚厚的污垢和泥泞遮挡住了。一对小窗户从壁画上方照射下来——如果它们也没有完全被遮挡的话。",
	"If cleansed (see the {@area \"Removing Ooze Grime\"|20.rog|x} sidebar), the mural is revealed to be a triptych that depicts: (1) a priest building a mechanical moth; (2) the priest releasing the moth to fly toward the sun; and (3) the priest showing pride at a job well done.": "如果被净化（见{@area \"Removing Ooze Grime\"|20.rog|x}边栏），壁画会展现为一个三联画，描绘了：（1）一位牧师在制造机械蛾；（2）牧师释放蛾飞向太阳；以及（3）牧师展现出对工作出色的自豪。",

	"The ooze-based grime used by the cultists to defile the chapel is strangely resistant to prestidigitation and other magic that would otherwise easily remove such filth.

	"Front and center in this room, a lone skeleton sits slumped over a desk, a large tome under its hand and skull. A closed wardrobe leans against one wall, a fouled wash basin by another. The room is covered in dust, but seems to have escaped the defacement seen in the vestibule.": "在这个房间的正中央，一个孤独的骷髅瘫坐在一张桌子前，手下放着一本厚重的书，头骨靠在书上。一扇关闭的衣柜靠在一面墙上，另一面墙边有一个脏兮兮的洗脸盆。房间布满了灰尘，但似乎没有像门厅那样被破坏。",

	"A ragged rug stretches along the length of this room, flanked by twin rows of moldering pews. Three devotional alcoves line the eastern and western walls, inside of which stand pedestals with shattered stained glass littering the floor around them.

Natural light from above filters into the room through in a kaleidoscopic haze from the few intact stained glass windows that remain.": "一块破旧的地毯沿着房间的长度铺展开来，两排腐朽的长凳与之相对。东西墙上各有三个虔诚的小隔间，里面有支撑着破碎的彩色玻璃的基座。在巨大的房间北端有两个大讲坛，位于远端的高耸祭坛前。从上方透过几扇保存完好的彩色玻璃窗户，自然光透过形成万花筒般的光影洒进房间。",

	"The easiest way to free the {@creature púca|ToB3} is to quench the ritual flame in the brazier.
