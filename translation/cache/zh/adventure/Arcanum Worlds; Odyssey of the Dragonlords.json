	"Welcome to {@italic Odyssey of the Dragonlords}. This booklet will provide you with everything you need to run an epic campaign in the forgotten land of Thylea.": "欢迎来到{@italic Odyssey of the Dragonlords}。这本小册子将为您提供在遗忘之地Thylea中进行史诗般冒险所需的一切。",
	"{@italic Odyssey of the Dragonlords} is heavily inspired by stories from ancient Greek mythology. As we designed the campaign, we sought to include ideas from many different sources: {@italic The Odyssey, The Iliad, Jason and the Argonauts, The Oresteia,} and others. However, Thylea is {@bold not} ancient Greece. You will not find Zeus, Athena, or Apollo among the gods.": "{@italic Odyssey of the Dragonlords} 受古希腊神话故事的启发。在设计这个冒险时，我们试图融合许多不同来源的想法：{@italic The Odyssey, The Iliad, Jason and the Argonauts, The Oresteia,} 和其他。然而，Thylea 是{@bold not} 古希腊。你不会在众神中找到宙斯、雅典娜或阿波罗。",
	"As you explore Thylea, you will encounter familiar tropes, monsters, and treasures from Greek mythology—but the rules are different here. Mortals have only recently come to these lands. The world of Thylea blends high fantasy with the trappings of ancient history. Elves, dwarves, and halflings now live alongside minotaurs, centaurs, and satyrs.": "当你探索锡莱亚时，你会遇到熟悉的希腊神话中的主题、怪物和宝藏，但规则在这里是不同的。凡人们只是最近来到这片土地。锡莱亚的世界将高奇幻与古代历史的陷阱融为一体。精灵、矮人和半身人现在与牛头人、半人马和羊人同住。",
	"Our goal is to make your party feel like heroes from one of the greatest stories ever told—but the ultimate end of that story is entirely within your power. Your players will make choices that forever change the world of Thylea. As the gamemaster, we encourage you to embrace this idea and run with it. How will your players reshape history—and what does it mean to be a hero?": "我们的目标是让你的派对感觉像是最伟大故事中的英雄之一，但故事的最终结局完全取决于你们。你的玩家将做出决定，永远改变Thylea的世界。作为游戏主，我们鼓励你拥抱这个想法并深入挖掘。你的玩家将如何重塑历史，成为英雄意味着什么？",
	"For thousands of years, the Titans were the lords of this land.": "数千年来，泰坦巨人一直是这片土地的主宰。",
	"The Dragonlords drove back their armies; then fell to Sydon's hand.": "龙领主们击退了他们的军队；然后倒在了Sydon的手中。",
	"Five Gods from the heavens came, as the Oracle had foreseen.": "五位来自天上的神灵降临，正如先知所预见的。",
	"And a sacred oath was sealed with the blood of the Silver Queen.": "一个神圣的誓约是用银女王的鲜血封印的。",
	"Five hundred years have passed, but the peace has been in vain.": "五百年过去了，但和平却是徒劳无功。",
	"The time has come for war in Thylea once again.": "泰莱亚（Thylea）再次迎来了战争的时刻。",
	"The very first epic roleplaying campaign took place over 3,000 years ago. A band of heroes gathered to undertake an impossible quest, and among them were the children of Hermes, Apollo, Poseidon, and Zeus. They were the Argonauts—the legendary sailors led by Jason. Their ranks included Orpheus, the most talented musician in the world, and Peleus, the father of Achilles. They were even joined by Hercules, the famous warrior, who had recently completed his fabled Twelve Labors.": "第一个史诗级角色扮演战役发生在3000多年前。 一群英雄聚集在一起，开始了一次不可能的探险，其中包括了赫尔墨斯、阿波罗、波塞冬和宙斯的孩子。 他们就是阿尔戈英雄——由杰森领导的传奇水手。 他们的队伍中有奥菲欧斯，世界上最有才华的音乐家，还有阿喀琉斯的父亲佩里乌斯。 甚至还有赫拉克勒斯，这位著名的战士，刚刚完成了他传说中的十二项艰巨任务。",
	"Why should we liken the heroes of the {@italic Argonautika} to a party of roleplayers? Because in spite of their illustrious qualifications, and in spite of prophecies which foretold success, the Argonauts were ill-equipped for the challenges that awaited them. They abandoned their quest almost as soon as they set sail, and the rest of the story unfolds like a comedy of errors.": "为什么我们应该将{@italic Argonautika}的英雄比作角色扮演者的一群呢？因为尽管他们具有显赫的资格，尽管有预言预示着成功，阿尔戈英雄们却对等待着他们的挑战毫无准备。他们几乎在起航后立即放弃了追求，接下来的故事就像一出错误连篇的喜剧。",
	"Fellow game masters, stop me if this sounds familiar.": "各位游戏主，如果我说的听起来很熟悉，请制止我。",
	"Jason of Iolcos bears an uncanny resemblance to your average tabletop roleplayer. When he isn't accidentally slaughtering his own allies, he's wallowing in self-pity and bemoaning his bad luck. He seems just as frightened to lead the party as he is of being usurped. At multiple points in the story, the gods are forced to step in and save the Argonauts from his terrible leadership. In the end, the Golden Fleece is secured through the magic of the sorceress Medea. She isn't even counted among the so-called heroes.": "伊奥尔科斯（Iolcos）的杰森与你平均的桌面角色扮演者有着惊人的相似之处。当他不是意外地屠杀自己的盟友时，他就陷入自怜之中，抱怨自己的厄运。他似乎同样害怕领导队伍，也害怕被篡位。在故事的多个关键点，众神不得不介入，拯救阿尔戈英雄队（Argonauts）免受他糟糕领导的影响。最终，通过女巫梅狄亚（Medea）的魔法，黄金羊毛被获得。她甚至没有被列为所谓的英雄之一。",
	"The heroes of Greek mythology are very different from the super-powered, self-sacrificing paragons that we've come to idolize in Hollywood films. In the Greek epics, there is no clear line between good and evil, no villains to thwart, no alien invasions to repel. Heroic deeds are frequently puzzling and at times infuriating. Odysseus punctuates his harrowing journey home by murdering all the men who courted his wife. Achilles refuses to fight when his men need him most. Jason quickly abandons Medea once his quest is finished.": "希腊神话中的英雄与我们在好莱坞电影中崇拜的超级力量、自我牺牲的楷模截然不同。在希腊史诗中，没有明确的善恶界限，没有反派要阻止，也没有外星入侵需要击退。英雄的行为经常令人费解，有时甚至令人愤怒。奥德修斯在充满艰辛的归途中，最终杀死了所有追求他妻子的男人。阿喀琉斯在士兵最需要他的时候拒绝战斗。杰森在完成任务后迅速抛弃了梅狄亚。",
	"Because of their flaws, it is hard to shake the feeling that the heroes of the Greek epics were real historical figures. When might fails, they succeed through cunning, and when cunning fails, they succeed through luck. These were mortal men cast into impossible situations, forced to survive through spectacular means, and left to brood on the fickle whims of fate. In spite of their divine parentage, they were, above all, very {@italic human}.": "由于他们的缺陷，很难摆脱这样一种感觉，即希腊史诗中的英雄是真实的历史人物。当智慧失败时，他们通过谋略成功；当谋略失败时，他们通过运气成功。这些是被投入到不可能的情况中的凡人，被迫通过壮观手段生存，并被留在命运善变的忧思中。尽管他们有神圣的血统，但最重要的是，他们是非常{@italic human}。",
	"This is in large part what makes these characters so enduring in the Western imagination. But most importantly, it makes them the perfect archetypes for the heroes of your next roleplaying campaign.": "这在很大程度上是使得这些角色在西方想象中如此持久的原因。但更重要的是，它使它们成为你下一个角色扮演游戏战役中的完美原型。",
	"{@italic Odyssey of the Dragonlords} casts your players into the roles of {@bold mythic heroes}, who have been the subjects of a dire prophecy. This prophecy pits a small band of mortals against the last of the Titans—and promises an epic conflict that will forever reshape the world of Thylea.": "{@italic Odyssey of the Dragonlords}将您的玩家扮演成{@bold mythic heroes}的角色，他们成为了一则可怕预言的对象。这个预言让一小群凡人对抗泰坦的最后一人，并承诺一场将永远改变泰莱亚世界的史诗般冲突。",
	"Mythic heroes have dealings with the gods, almost as a matter of course. The gods are not always nice. They are jealous, capricious, cruel, generous, vengeful, kind, vicious, forgetful, thoughtless, lusty, selfish, passionate, and generally all-too-human in their ways. They do not know everything and cannot control everything, but within their spheres of influence, they are awesome, terrible, and dangerous. It's a foolish mortal who disrespects the gods. The wisest heroes acknowledge the power of the gods over every aspect of life.": "传奇英雄与诸神打交道，几乎是理所当然的事情。神并非总是善良的。他们嫉妒、反复无常、残忍、慷慨、复仇心切、仁慈、邪恶、健忘、轻率、好色、自私、充满激情，总体上表现得过于人性化。他们并不全知全能，但在各自的影响范围内，他们是令人敬畏、可怕和危险的存在。愚蠢的凡人会不敬神明。最明智的英雄会承认神对生活的方方面面都具有力量。",
	"Mythic heroes must also contend with the will of mortal kings and queens. Earth-shattering events demand action from the most powerful rulers from across the land, but their hands are often bound by the vagaries of fate. Sometimes, they are forced to take up arms and join the quest themselves, but more often they must depend upon the might of famous heroes.": "传奇英雄们也必须应对凡间国王和女王的意志。地动山摇的事件需要来自全国最强大统治者的行动，但他们的手常常被命运的变幻所束缚。有时，他们被迫拿起武器加入探险，但更常见的是他们必须依赖著名英雄的力量。",
	"Mythic heroes are often bound to their quest by powerful oaths. Oaths are inviolable sacred vows that are sworn only in the most serious of circumstances. Oaths have a powerful, far-reaching effect on society. They may create peace between the gods, promote unbreakable fellowships, and even instigate bloody wars.": "传说中的英雄经常被强大的誓言束缚着完成他们的任务。誓言是不可侵犯的神圣誓言，只有在最严肃的情况下才会发誓。誓言对社会有着强大而深远的影响。它们可能在神祇之间创造和平，促进不可分割的伙伴关系，甚至引发血腥的战争。",
	"No mortal of sound mind would ever dare break an oath, lest they be afflicted by terrible curses. To be cursed by the gods is to be cursed by the land itself. Food turns to dust in the mouths of those who are cursed. Harpies peck out their eyes, and their souls are dragged screaming into the Underworld.": "任何头脑清醒的凡人都不敢违背誓言，否则将受到可怕的诅咒。被诸神诅咒就等于被大地所诅咒。被诅咒者口中的食物会变成尘土。哈比鸟会啄出他们的眼睛，他们的灵魂会被尖叫着拖入冥界。",
	"For this reason, even the bravest of heroes fear the consequences of breaking an oath. The gods, on the other hand, are literally incapable of breaking their oaths, for they are made from the same magic that binds and enforces them.": "因此，即使是最勇敢的英雄也害怕违背誓言的后果。另一方面，诸神们实际上无法违背他们的誓言，因为他们是由同样的魔法制成并强制执行的。",
	"All great heroes seek to increase their fame. This may sound like vanity, but within a mythic context, fame is essential to achieving one's goals. Famous heroes may summon warriors to their aid, influence the opinions of the masses, and even demand audiences with the gods. Though seeking it may shorten one's life, fame is the most direct route to immortality. But the danger of increasing one's fame is hubris. Excessive pride, or hubris, leads to the downfall and destruction of many famous heroes who overestimate their abilities—or who underestimate the gods.": "所有伟大的英雄都追求增加他们的名声。这听起来像虚荣，但在神话背景下，名声对于实现一个人的目标至关重要。著名的英雄可以召唤战士来帮助他们，影响群众的意见，甚至要求与众神会面。虽然追求名声可能会缩短一个人的生命，但名声是通往永生的最直接途径。但增加名声的危险是傲慢。过度的自负，或傲慢，导致许多著名英雄的失败和毁灭，他们高估了自己的能力，或低估了众神。",
	"Mythic heroes are subject to the forces of fate and prophecy in equal measure. Fate directs the lives of both gods and mortals, and though she is the greatest of all mysteries, she is also cruel to those who defy her. The greatest gift she gives us is the gift of prophecy.": "传说中的英雄同样受命运和预言的影响。 命运指引着众神和凡人的生活，虽然她是所有神秘中最伟大的，但对那些违抗她的人也是残酷的。 她赐予我们最伟大的礼物是预言的恩赐。",
	"Prophecies reveal paths that would otherwise be hidden to us—paths which allow us to rise to our fate, rather than be destroyed by it. Such paths are often dangerous, and walking them may seem like madness, but that is the task of the mythic hero. To dismiss prophecy and spurn one's fate is hubris of the highest order.": "预言揭示了那些本应对我们隐藏的道路——这些道路让我们得以应对命运，而非被命运摧毁。这些道路常常充满危险，走在其中可能看起来像是疯狂，但这正是神话英雄的任务。轻视预言，拒绝命运，是最高程度的傲慢。",
	"In the end, the story of a mythic hero falls into one of two categories. Those who win fame by rising to their fate and honoring their oaths may be forced to make tragic sacrifices, but they will be happier in the end. On the other hand, those who turn from fate, break their oaths, and curse the gods will meet tragic endings, even if their lives are happier in the short run.": "最后，一个神话英雄的故事可以归为两类。那些通过迎接命运并履行誓言赢得名声的人可能会被迫做出悲剧性的牺牲，但他们最终会更幸福。另一方面，那些背弃命运、违背誓言并诅咒众神的人将会迎来悲剧性的结局，即使他们的生活在短期内更幸福。",
	"In other words, mythic heroism means rising to the challenges that fate throws at you, even when the gods themselves work against you. It means losing yourself in the wilderness for decades, only to return in glory when your enemies least expect it. It also means betraying your loved ones, overthrowing rightful kings because of petty grievances, and discovering that you were a pawn of prophecy all along.": "换句话说，神话英雄主义意味着应对命运给你带来的挑战，即使是众神都在反对你。这意味着在荒野中迷失数十年，只有当你的敌人最不期待时才荣耀归来。这也意味着背叛你所爱的人，因为琐事而推翻合法的国王，并发现你始终是预言的棋子。",
	"Mythic heroes do not lead easy lives, but they do lead dramatic ones. It's not just the victories that make their adventures memorable—it's the failures, also.": "传奇英雄的生活并不轻松，但却充满戏剧性。使他们的冒险令人难忘的不仅仅是胜利，还有失败。(Mythic heroes)",
	"This book is designed to help you run a story-driven roleplaying campaign that combines classic fantasy dungeon crawling with the epic sweep of Greek mythology. It takes place in the world of Thylea—a forgotten continent where fey creatures make war upon civilization and gods walk the earth in the guise of mortals.": "这本书旨在帮助您组织一个以故事为驱动的角色扮演活动，结合了经典的奇幻地牢探险和希腊神话史诗的宏大氛围。故事发生在忘却大陆Thylea的世界中——那里是一个被遗忘的大陆，精灵生物与文明交战，众神化身凡人行走在大地上。",
	"The campaign is designed for the 5th Edition of the world's greatest roleplaying game. It has been designed for a party of 4–6 heroes of 1st level. By the end of the campaign, the heroes should be 15th level or higher.": "这个活动是为《世界上最伟大的角色扮演游戏》第5版设计的。它是为1级的4-6名英雄队伍设计的。到活动结束时，英雄们应该达到15级或更高级。",
	"{@italic Odyssey of the Dragonlords} combines an epic story with a structured, open world. As the players complete major milestones in the story, new parts of the world will become available for them to explore. The story is divided into a prologue and five acts, the last being an epic finale.": "{@italic Odyssey of the Dragonlords} 将史诗故事与结构化的开放世界相结合。随着玩家完成故事中的重要里程碑，世界的新部分将对他们开放探索。故事分为序幕和五幕，最后一幕是史诗结局。",
	"The goal of this adventure is to explore what it means to be a hero in a land where gods and Titans still walk the earth—where the forces of civilization are only just beginning to prevail against the monsters that haunt the seas and the forests. Your players will take on the role of mythic heroes charged with fulfilling a prophecy and confronting the Titans. Their decisions will shape the future and forever change the world of Thylea.": "这个冒险的目标是探索在一个神神仙仙仍在大地上行走的土地上成为英雄意味着什么——在文明力量只是开始对抗那些鬼魅海洋和森林中的怪物的土地上。你的玩家将扮演神话英雄的角色，肩负着实现预言和面对泰坦的使命。他们的决定将塑造未来，永远改变蒂莱亚的世界。",

	"For many ages, Thylea was a wilderness of centaurs, satyrs, cyclopes, and other creatures who worshipped their native gods, the Titans. Mortals who came to Thylea lived in small, defenseless tribes—until the arrival of the Dragonlords.": "许多年来，(Thylea) 被半人马、萨特、独眼巨人和其他崇拜他们本土神祇泰坦的生物所占据，是一片荒野。来到(Thylea) 的凡人生活在小而无力的部落中，直到龙领主的到来。",
	"The Dragonlords were an order of heroic, dragon-riding mortals who came to Thylea five centuries ago. They initiated the First War against the Titans and defeated their armies. Most of the Dragonlords and their dragons were killed during this conflict.": "龙领主们是五个世纪前来到蒂莱亚的英雄人类秩序，他们骑着龙。他们发动了第一次对抗泰坦的战争，并击败了他们的军队。在这场冲突中，大多数龙领主和他们的龙都被杀死了。",
	"When all seemed lost, the mortals of Thylea were saved by the sudden appearance of the Five Gods, who walked the land in mortal guise. They forced the Titans into a temporary truce, called the Oath of Peace.": "当一切似乎已经失去希望时，蒂莱亚的凡人们被五位神明突然出现所拯救，他们以凡人的形象行走于大地之上。他们迫使泰坦们达成了一项暂时的休战，称为和平誓约(Oath of Peace)。",
	"The Oath of Peace has prevented open warfare with the Titans for five hundred years. But now, the truce is ending. The power of the Five Gods wanes, and the Titans prepare to wage war upon mortals once again.": "和平誓约已经阻止了与泰坦的公开战争五百年。但现在，休战即将结束。五位神祗的力量减弱，泰坦准备再次对凡人发动战争。",

	"Thylea is located across a great expanse of ocean, far beyond the borders of the known world. It is a land of great beauty and ancient splendor, untouched and unspoiled by civilization since the dawn of time.": "泰莱亚（Thylea）位于一个广阔的海洋之外，远在已知世界的边界之外。这是一个美丽而古老辉煌的土地，自时间之初以来就未被文明触及或破坏。",
	"Thylea is sometimes called \"the Lost Land.\" It has a large central landmass which tapers into peninsulas surrounded by hundreds of islands. Beyond that, on all sides a clear expanse of ocean called the Forgotten Sea stretches for a thousand miles in every direction.": "泰莱亚有时被称为“失落之地”。它有一个大型中央陆地，逐渐变为被数百个岛屿环绕的半岛。在那之外，四面环绕着一片清澈的被称为遗忘之海的海洋，向四面八方延伸了一千英里。",
	"Sprawling ruins, glittering lagoons, and massive statues dot Thylea's landscape. Great beasts wander her plains, and fey creatures haunt her woods. Centaur tribes war for control on the steppes, and reptilian savages battle across her islands. Although Thylea is a land with a long history, most of it has been lost.": "广阔的废墟，闪闪发光的泻湖，以及巨大的雕像点缀着锡莱亚（Thylea）的风景。巨兽漫步在她的平原上，精灵生物出没在她的森林中。半人马部落在草原上争夺控制权，爬行野蛮人在她的岛屿上激烈战斗。尽管锡莱亚是一个历史悠久的土地，但大部分历史已经湮灭。",
	"At the heart of the archipelago the Mother Goddess, in the form of a colossal world-tree, watches over her creation. She is also called Thylea, and her true name is lost to time. Her children are Sydon and Lutheria, the Twin Titans, who dwell in the far reaches of the ocean. They are the masters of everything under the endless expanse of the sky.": "在群岛的中心，母亲女神以巨大的世界树的形式守护着她的创造物。她也被称为 (Thylea)，她的真名已经随着时间的流逝而失传。她的孩子是双子泰坦Sydon和Lutheria，他们居住在海洋的边缘。他们是无尽天空下一切的主宰。",
	"In the centuries before the founding of Mytros, mortals had no dominion over the untamed lands of Thylea. When elves, dwarves, and humans washed up on Thylea's shores, their weapons failed them, and their magic ceased to work. They were forsaken by their gods, forced to live as beggars among the fey races.": "在米特洛斯(`Mytros`)建立之前的几个世纪里，凡人对蒂莱亚(`Thylea`)的未开垦土地毫无控制权。当精灵、矮人和人类漂泊到蒂莱亚的海岸时，他们的武器失灵了，他们的魔法也无法施展。他们被他们的神明抛弃，被迫在仙族中过着乞丐般的生活。",
	"Curious about these strange refugees, the nymphs and satyrs offered them hospitality, and many small settlements were founded. The centaurs, however, offered them no quarter, and the cyclopes were known to devour men whole. Life in Thylea was short and brutal for the so-called 'trespassers' from foreign lands.": "对于这些奇怪的难民感到好奇，仙女和半人半兽者为他们提供了款待，许多小定居点应运而生。然而，半人马却对他们毫不留情，独眼巨人也以整个吞噬人类而著称。对于来自外国的所谓“入侵者”来说，泰勒亚的生活是短暂而残酷的。",
	"During this era, the Twin Titans wielded great powers, unlike anything seen since the dawn of time. Sydon was venerated as the Lord of Storms. He could conjure apocalyptic storms with his right hand and cataclysmic earthquakes with his left hand. His sister-wife Lutheria held dominion over the land of dreams, and her voice was said to give life to the dead.": "在这个时代，双子泰坦拥有强大的力量，这是自时间之初以来所未见的。西顿(Sydon)被尊崇为风暴之主。他能用右手召唤末日般的风暴，用左手引发灾难性的地震。他的姐妹妻子露瑟利亚(Lutheria)统治着梦境之地，据说她的声音能让死者复活。",
	"Fearing eradication, the desperate mortal settlers built shrines to Sydon and held feasts in Lutheria's honor. Thousands of sacrifices were dedicated to the Lord of Storms, and libations of wine were poured to the Lady of Dreams at every meal. The twins were at first unswayed but, over time, they warmed to the persistent worship of the hapless settlers.": "担心被消灭，绝望的凡人定居者建造了供奉(Sydon)的神龛，并举行了(Lutheria)的仪式。成千上万的祭品奉献给风暴之神，每顿饭都向梦境女神倾注了葡萄酒。这对双胞胎起初并未受到影响，但随着时间的推移，他们渐渐对这些不幸的定居者的坚定崇拜产生了好感。",
	"In exchange for this devotion, the Titans offered the mortals oaths of protection, which shielded them from the worst ravages of the centaurs and cyclopes. The settlements survived, but they were always at the mercy of the Twins. So it remained for many hundreds of years.": "作为回报，泰坦为凡人提供了保护誓约，使他们免受半人马和独眼巨人的最严重破坏。定居点幸存了下来，但它们总是受到双子的摆布。如此情况持续了许多百年。",

	"Within just a few years of their arrival, many small cities were founded, and a half-dozen small kingdoms sprang up along the roads of the western reaches. The Dragonlords founded powerful dynasties, and the humble mortals who had once lived in terror of the Titans now abandoned their temples and stood tall.": "仅仅几年后，许多小城市被建立起来，一半以上的小王国沿着西部地区的道路兴起。龙领主们建立了强大的王朝，曾经生活在泰坦恐惧中的平凡凡人们现在放弃了他们的神庙，挺立起来。",
	"The Dragonlords were symbols of hope for a beleaguered people. Whenever any mortal settlement was razed to the ground by roving centaurs and cyclopes, the Dragonlords would repay the attackers in kind. Through harsh winters, blistering summers, and relentless assaults by the native races, the Dragonlords fought tirelessly, and the people of Thylea persevered.": "龙领主们是备受困扰的人民的希望象征。每当任何凡人定居点被游荡的半人马和独眼巨人夷平时，龙领主们都会以牙还牙。在严寒的冬天、酷热的夏天和土著种族的无情袭击下，龙领主们不知疲倦地战斗，而蒂莱亚的人民坚持下来。",
	"Everywhere the dragons were greeted with shouts of adulation. When spotted flying overhead, they would be hailed as saviors, and great songs and feasts would be held in their honor. They were radiant to behold, bronze scales gleaming like fire. To be visited by one of the dragons was to be blessed; and nowhere was more blessed than the City of Mytros.": "到处都有人欢呼龙的到来。当它们被发现飞过头顶时，会被称为救世主，为它们举行盛大的歌舞盛宴以示敬意。它们的光辉令人惊叹，青铜鳞片闪闪发光如同火焰。被龙拜访是一种祝福；而没有比米特洛斯城更受祝福的地方了。",
	"But the great powers that ruled Thylea grew jealous. Sydon and Lutheria, the Twin Titans, immortal children of the mother goddess, amassed great armies to eradicate the city. The Dragonlords responded by gathering all the mortals in Thylea into a united assault on the native races, and so began the First War.": "但统治泰莱亚的强大力量变得嫉妒起来。赛登(Sydon)和卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria)，作为母神的不朽子女，聚集了庞大的军队，意图消灭这座城市。龙领主们(Dragonlords)回应道，将泰莱亚所有凡人聚集起来，发动一场对土著种族的联合进攻，第一次战争就此展开。",
	"The histories of the First War are vague, having been passed down through the centuries in the form of decaying scrolls and tapestries. What is known for certain is that the native races were driven into exile. The centaurs retreated into the steppes, while the satyrs fled into the forests. The Gygans, an ancient civilization of cyclopes, were annihilated, leaving behind the crumbling ruins of their fallen cities.": "第一次战争的历史模糊不清，通过几个世纪以来逐渐腐烂的卷轴和挂毯传承下来。可以确定的是，当地种族被驱逐出境。半人马撤退到了大草原，而山羊人逃进了森林。吉甘人，一个古老的独眼巨人文明，被消灭了，只留下了他们倒塌城市的残垣断壁。",
	"The cost of victory was great: by the time the war ended, the last of the dragons had been killed defending the city they loved most. Although the Dragonlords are remembered as the great heroes of this age, their noble dragons came to be equally venerated as guardian spirits. The blood of their sacrifice is woven into the stones of Mytros, and to this day the city is said to glow radiant bronze at sunset.": "胜利的代价是巨大的：战争结束时，最后一只龙为保卫他们最爱的城市而牺牲。尽管龙领主们被记为这个时代的伟大英雄，他们高贵的龙也被视为守护灵。他们的牺牲之血融入了迈特洛斯的石头中，直到今天这座城市在日落时被说成闪耀着辉煌的青铜色。",
	"Perhaps most miraculous of all, however, was the appearance of the Five Gods. These immortal figures descended from heaven when the tide had turned against the Dragonlords. Some have claimed that they were manifestations of Thylea's own desire to protect her immigrant children. They took the form of mortal men and women, but their eyes were alight with the fire of divinity.": "然而，最令人称奇的也许是五位神祇的出现。当潮水开始转向反对龙领主们时，这些不朽的身影从天堂降临。有人声称他们是泰莉亚自身对保护她的移民子民的愿望的体现。他们化身为凡人男女的形态，但他们的眼睛闪烁着神性之火。",
	"The people of Thylea do not know the true nature of the Five Gods. Only the gods know it, and they are forbidden to talk about it by the Oath of Peace. The story finale includes a major twist where the Five Gods return to their true forms. Don't spoil this epic moment for your players!": "泰莱亚人民不知道五位神祇的真正本质。只有神明知晓，而根据和平誓约，他们被禁止谈论此事。故事结局包含一个重大的转折，五位神祇回归到他们真正的形态。不要在玩家面前泄露这一史诗时刻！",
	"Each of these new gods manifested some portion of the power that had once belonged to the Titans. Pythor, the Lord of Battle, took command of the centurions of Mytros and, after many gruesome battles, the armies of the native races were broken. When the final spear had been thrust into the heart of the Gygan King, the Five Gods fell into a torpor, apparently to recover their strength. The city, it seemed, was safe.": "这些新神之中，每一位都显露出曾属于泰坦的部分力量。战神皮索(Pythor)，掌管着迈特洛斯的百夫长，经过多次残酷的战斗，打败了当地种族的军队。当最后一枪刺入巨人王的心脏时，五位神陷入了昏睡，显然是在恢复力量。这座城市，似乎是安全的。",
	"But Sydon and Lutheria swore vengeance. The mountains shook, the seas boiled with rage, and spine-chilling nightmares descended upon the mortal armies. Such was the anger of the Titans that their retaliation threatened to sunder the very foundations of Thylea.": "但赛登(Sydon)和卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria)发誓要报仇。群山震动，海洋沸腾愤怒，令人毛骨悚然的噩梦降临在凡人军队之上。泰坦的愤怒如此之大，他们的报复威胁着要撕裂泰莱亚(Thylea)的根基。",
	"In the end, Mytros, the goddess of dawn, sacrificed herself and ascended once more to the heavens in order to rescue her beloved city from destruction.": "最后，黎明女神（Mytros）牺牲了自己，再次升入天堂，以拯救她心爱的城市免于毁灭。",
	"Having lost their mounts, the Dragonlords commissioned a fleet of warships and took to the seas. The greatest of these ships was called the Ultros, captained by one Estor Arkelander. He is said to have sailed into the very depths of the underworld where Lutheria sleeps upon her diamond throne. The other Dragonlords are said to have ascended Phraxys, the Tower of Sydon, where the Lord of Storms watches all.": "失去了他们的坐骑后，龙领主们委托建造了一支战舰舰队，开始了海上征战。其中最强大的船只被称为乌尔特洛斯号，由一位名叫埃斯托·阿克兰德( Estor Arkelander)的船长指挥。据说他驾驶船只航行到了地底深处，那里是露瑟莉亚( Lutheria)坐在她的钻石宝座上沉睡的地方。其他龙领主们据说登上了西顿之塔(Phraxys)，那里是风暴之神的领地，统御着一切。",
	"Many songs are sung of the trials and troubles of the Dragonlords, but few can say what actually transpired during their final journey into the perils of the Forgotten Sea. The priests of Mytros watched for signs of the impending apocalypse. On the night of the winter solstice, when Thylea's doom seemed near, the boiling seas suddenly calmed and the nightmares ended.": "许多歌曲唱响着龙领主们经历的考验和困难，但很少有人能说出他们最终踏上被遗忘之海危险的旅程时究竟发生了什么。Mytros的祭司们密切关注着末日降临的迹象。在冬至之夜，当泰莱亚的厄运似乎临近时，沸腾的海洋突然平静下来，噩梦也结束了。",
	"Some days later, a black ship sailed into the harbor of Mytros, carrying the bodies of many of the Dragonlords. The ship was captained by Damon, a powerful wizard who had served the Dragonlords during the First War. He was mortally wounded, but he uttered not a single word. He delivered three precious items to the Temple of the Five, and then vanished in his ship, along with the bodies and arms of his fallen masters.": "几天后，一艘黑色的船驶入了（Mytros）港口，船上载着许多龙领主的尸体。这艘船的船长是（Damon），一位在第一次战争期间曾为龙领主效力的强大法师。他身受致命伤，但却没有说一句话。他将三件珍贵的物品交给了五神殿，然后与他倒下的主人们的尸体和武器一起消失在了船上。",
	"One of the items that Damon carried was a scroll of parchment, upon which was written the Oath of Peace. This Oath was cause for great celebration. Sydon and Lutheria had sworn not to take vengeance upon the mortals of Thylea for a period of 500 years, provided that daily sacrifices to the Titans should resume, and that their temples should be maintained and honored.": "达蒙(Damon)携带的物品之一是一卷羊皮卷轴，上面写着和平誓约(Oath of Peace)。这个誓约引起了极大的庆祝。赛登(Sydon)和卢塞里亚(Lutheria)发誓在接下来的500年里不对泰莱亚(Thylea)的凡人报复，前提是每天要向泰坦(Titans)献祭，并且要继续维护和尊敬他们的神庙。",
	"The Oath of Peace has prevailed for 500 years and, throughout this age, the mortals of Thylea have flourished. The City of Mytros grew into a great metropolis, and it has been protected by the twin Colossi, beacons of civilization on the shores of a dark frontier. More settlers came from beyond the Forgotten Sea, and the ranks of humans, dwarves, and elves grew. The remaining Dragonlords became kings and established dynasties to rule over the new cities that were founded across the land. As the worship of the Five spread, so also did their power over the land and oceans grow, until every village boasted shrines to Volkan and Pythor, and the dominion of Sydon and Lutheria was nearly forgotten.": "和平誓约已经持续了500年，在这个时代里，泰莱亚的凡人们蓬勃发展。米特洛斯城市发展成为一个伟大的大都市，并且得到了双子巨像的保护，它们是黑暗边境海岸上文明的灯塔。更多的定居者从被遗忘之海的彼岸而来，人类、矮人和精灵的人数增加。剩下的龙领主成为国王，建立了王朝来统治这片土地上新建立的城市。随着对五神的崇拜传播，他们对土地和海洋的控制力也增长，直到每个村庄都有供奉沃尔坎和皮索尔的神龛，而西登和卢瑟利亚的统治几乎被遗忘。",
	"The Five Gods loved their people and made sure to walk amongst them whenever they could.": "五位神明热爱他们的子民，并确保尽可能经常与他们同行。",
	"While five centuries may seem like an eternity, the time now grows near where this period of peace must finally come to an end.": "虽然五个世纪似乎是一段漫长的时间，但现在已经接近了这段和平时期最终结束的时刻。",
	"With the imminent end of the Oath of Peace, the Oracle has prophesied the Doom of Thylea: the death of the gods, the destruction of the sacred tree, and the total annihilation of all mortal races.": "随着和平誓约的即将结束，神谕预言了泰莱亚的末日：众神之死，圣树的毁灭，以及所有凡人种族的彻底消灭。",
	"Players in this campaign will take on the role of a group of heroes who have been summoned to the Temple of the Oracle in an attempt to avert this catastrophe.": "在这个冒险中，玩家们将扮演一群英雄，他们被召唤到（Temple of the Oracle）的神庙，试图避免这场灾难。",
	"Adventurers who explore the oceans of their world to their farthest reaches will eventually discover the Maelstrom: a terrifying region of hurricanes, whirlpools, and jagged rocks. Drunken sailors often boast of death-defying encounters within the Maelstrom, but none who have sailed its waters have ever returned.": "探险者们探索他们世界的海洋直至极限，最终会发现旋涡海域：一个充满飓风、漩涡和锯齿状岩石的可怕区域。醉醺醺的水手们经常吹嘘在旋涡海域中与死神擦肩而过的经历，但从未有人在其水域中航行归来。",
	"Adventurers who brave the Maelstrom must spend days battling storms, skirting whirlpools, and navigating through treacherous shoals. The passage is so intense that the crew is likely to be rendered unconscious. Lucky adventurers will awaken in calmer waters, under a cloudless sky—a glittering green expanse known as the Forgotten Sea.": "冒险者们勇敢地面对着旋涡必须花费数日与风暴搏斗，避开漩涡，并穿越危险的浅滩。这段航程如此激烈，以至于船员们很可能会陷入昏迷。幸运的冒险者们会在更平静的水域中苏醒，在一个晴空万里的绿色辉煌海域——被称为遗忘之海((Forgotten Sea))。",
	"The Forgotten Sea stretches for hundreds of miles in every direction, and it boasts hundreds of islands. Powerful ocean currents prevent ships from approaching these islands, and any attempt to do so will cause a ship to lose control and be smashed on a rocky shoreline.": "被遗忘的海洋在各个方向延伸数百英里，拥有数百个岛屿。强大的洋流阻止船只靠近这些岛屿，任何尝试这样做的船只都会失去控制并被摔碎在多岩石海岸线上。",
	"Watchful sailors may glimpse strange things on the islands: impossibly tall humans in fine clothing, monstrous reptilian beasts, and great stone carvings in the shape of human faces. Intrepid explorers will eventually catch sight of a towering bronze colossus shining brightly on the horizon. This beacon serves to guide ships into the harbor of Mytros, the greatest city in Thylea.": "警惕的水手们可能会在岛上瞥见奇怪的事物：穿着华丽服装的不可思议高大人类、怪兽般的爬行动物，以及人脸形状的巨大石雕。无畏的探险者最终会瞥见地平线上闪耀着明亮光芒的高大青铜巨像。这个灯塔用来引导船只驶入泰莱亚最伟大的城市米特洛斯（Mytros）的港口。",
	"Thylea may be found in almost any adventure setting. It exists beyond the boundaries of all maps, and its location is unknown to even the most experienced travelers.Sailors often shipwreck here from other worlds.": "泰莱亚（Thylea）可能出现在几乎任何冒险场景中。它存在于所有地图的边界之外，即使是最有经验的旅行者也不知道它的位置。水手们经常从其他世界遇难漂到这里。",

	"Thylea is the namesake of the Lost Land. She takes the form of a gargantuan tree on an island at the heart of the Cerulean Gulf, and her followers believe that her roots reach deep into the earth, binding the world together in an eternal embrace. Thylea is believed to be a generous, life-giving goddess. The Druids of the Oldwood believe that her will is communicated through the changing of the seasons, rather than through words. Long winters, for example, signal her displeasure; long summers are a sign of her approval.": "泰莉亚（Thylea）是失落之地的名字来源。她化身为巨大的一棵树，生长在塞鲁利安海湾中心的一个岛屿上，她的信徒相信她的根深深地扎根于大地之中，将世界紧密地连结在一起，永恒地拥抱着。泰莉亚被认为是一位慷慨、赐予生命的女神。旧林德鲁伊（Druids of the Oldwood）相信她的意志是通过季节的更迭来传达的，而不是通过言语。比如，漫长的冬天预示着她的不悦；而漫长的夏天则是她赞许的迹象。",
	"Kentimane was the most powerful of the Titans. He is believed to be both the husband and eternal guardian of the Great Mother. Many references are found to him in the poetry of the gygans and the centaurs, but few credible sources have survived the ravages of time.": "肯提曼(%Titan%)是泰坦神中最强大的。他被认为是大母神的丈夫和永恒守护者。在巨人和半人马的诗歌中可以找到许多关于他的引用，但很少有可靠的来源经受住了时间的摧残。",

	"Every temple in Thylea fears the wrath of Sydon. Daily sacrifices are offered to him in every village, even as the settlers continue their silent prayers to the Five. Whenever thunder rolls through the skies of Thylea, you can be sure that someone has provoked Sydon's anger.": "在泰勒亚（Thylea）的每座神庙都害怕赛登（Sydon）的愤怒。每个村庄都会每天向他献祭，即使定居者们继续默默地向五位神祈祷。每当雷声在泰勒亚的天空中响起时，你可以肯定有人激怒了赛登。",
	"Lutheria takes the form of a beautiful, black-eyed woman who sleepwalks through the underworld, greeting the spirits of the dead. She carries a crystal scythe, which she uses to harvest the souls of those who displeased her in life.

	"Worship of Lutheria is rare among settlers, but she is nevertheless honored with many feasts and festivals because Sydon demands it. Whenever any drink is poured, a libation must be made to Lutheria or else a swift punishment is sure to follow.": "在定居者中，对卢瑟莉亚的崇拜并不常见，但由于赛登的要求，她仍然受到许多盛宴和节日的尊敬。每当倒出任何饮料时，必须向卢瑟莉亚行酒祭，否则必定会受到迅速的惩罚。",
	"The Five Gods are widely celebrated as the settlers' favored gods. With the exception of Mytros, they are not heaven-dwelling deities but familiar faces who walk among their people. They have been known to take mortal husbands and wives, rule over cities, and sire demi-god children. They helped the Dragonlords and the mortal races to defeat Sydon and Lutheria during the First War. For centuries, they have blessed the mortal races, protecting them from tyrannical domination by Sydon and Lutheria.": "五位神祗被广泛认为是定居者最喜爱的神祗。除了(Mytros)，它们并非居住在天堂的神明，而是熟悉的面孔，常常在人民中间行走。它们以与凡人结合、统治城市、生育半神子女而闻名。它们帮助龙主和凡间种族在第一次战争中击败了(Sydon)和(Lutheria)。几个世纪以来，它们一直祝福着凡间种族，保护他们免受(Sydon)和(Lutheria)的暴政统治。",

She is the most powerful of the Five Gods, and the source of most priestly magic in Thylea.": "Mytros（Mytros）, 有人称之为“银女王”，是五位神灵中最仁慈的神灵，也是泰勒亚最重要王国的守护女神。她被广泛认为在第一次战争的毁灭和后果中拯救了这座城市，并据说她会以身披闪闪发光的金甲的战士女王的形象出现在她的祭司面前。在与Sydon和Lutheria进行了一场灾难性的战斗后，她升上了天堂，不再与凡人同行。她是五位神灵中最强大的，也是泰勒亚大部分神职魔法的源泉。",

	"Not much is known about Volkan except that he is the husband of Mytros. He concerns himself with artifice and crafting and is primarily worshipped by dwarves, smiths, and wizards. He is depicted as an elderly and wise-looking man (and sometimes as a dwarf). He is rumored to travel through the Heartlands on the winter solstice, distributing toys and sweets to children.": "关于沃尔坎（Volkan）的了解并不多，除了他是迈特洛斯（Mytros）的丈夫之外。他专注于工艺和制作，主要受到矮人、铁匠和巫师的崇拜。他被描绘为一位年迈且智慧的男人（有时也被描绘为矮人）。据传言，他会在冬至时节穿越心脏地带，给孩子们分发玩具和糖果。",
	"A son of Mytros and Volkan, Pythor appeared to the settlers during the First War and fought tirelessly against the centaurs and gygans that threatened to overwhelm the city of Mytros. His praises were sung for centuries after, and he is said to have walked among the settlers in mortal guise, taking women to his bed and fathering demi-god children. A few centuries ago he became the king of the city of Estoria when he overthrew a mad tyrant.": "Pythor（皮索尔）是迈特洛斯（Mytros）和沃尔坎（Volkan）之子，在第一次战争期间出现在移民们面前，不知疲倦地与威胁淹没迈特洛斯城的半人马和巨人作战。他的赞美声在几个世纪后仍被传颂，据说他曾以凡人的形象出现在移民中间，与女性结合并生下半神子女。几个世纪前，他推翻了一个疯狂的暴君，成为了埃斯托里亚（Estoria）城的国王。",
	"Vallus is revered as the goddess of wisdom and beauty, and she is believed to know as much about Thylea's history as Sydon and Lutheria. She was once known to travel far and wide, surveying ancient ruins and collecting lore concerning the origins of the land and the fey races. Prayers are offered to Vallus when guidance is needed and information is scarce. She is the oldest daughter of Mytros and, in many ways, she has inherited her mother's legacy, serving as both queen and patron goddess to the city.": "瓦卢斯(Vallus)被尊奉为智慧和美丽女神，据信她对泰勒亚(Thylea)的历史了如指掌，不亚于赛登(Sydon)和卢瑟里亚(Lutheria)。她曾被知晓远行，巡视古代遗迹，搜集关于这片土地和精灵种族起源的传说。当需要指引和信息稀缺时，人们会向瓦卢斯祈祷。她是迈特洛斯(Mytros)的长女，在许多方面继承了母亲的遗产，既是城市的女王，也是守护女神。",
	"Kyrah is revered as the trickster goddess of music and poetry. She is the swiftest of all the gods, capable of disappearing in the blink of an eye and she can travel great distances with each step. Her voice is said to be more beautiful than any musical instrument. There are very few shrines to her, except among bards, who revere her as the Muse.": "Kyrah（Kyrah）被尊奉为音乐和诗歌的恶作剧女神。她是所有神灵中最敏捷的，能在眨眼间消失，每一步都能行走很远。据说她的声音比任何乐器都更美妙。几乎没有什么神龛是为她而建的，除了诗人，他们尊奉她为缪斯（Muse）。",
	"The city of Mytros was the first settlement founded by the Dragonlords. It was protected by the Goddess of Dawn and grew into a mighty kingdom after the end of the First War. It is the largest city in all of Thylea and the center of commerce, religion, and politics. The Great Games are held outside of the city once a year. The Temple of the Five stands at the center of the city, but in recent years the worship of Sydon has been growing in popularity. The Titan now has his own grand temple that stands across the street from the Temple of the Five.": "Mytros城市是龙领主们建立的第一个定居点。在第一次战争结束后，它受到黎明女神的保护，并发展成一个强大的王国。它是泰勒亚所有城市中最大的，也是商业、宗教和政治的中心。每年在城市外举行一次大型比赛。五神殿矗立在城市中心，但近年来，西顿的崇拜日益流行。泰坦现在有自己宏伟的神庙，就在五神殿对面的街道上。",
	"Mytros is ruled by the mighty King Acastus, the last true descendant of the Dragonlords. Acastus is revered across all of Thylea and he is the husband of Queen Vallus, the wisest of the Five Gods. Through some miraculous feat of magic, he has recently resurrected the race of dragons, which were thought to be extinct since the end of the First War. He now seeks to rebuild the ancient order of the Dragonlords and restore the city of Mytros to its former glory.": "Mytros由强大的国王Acastus统治，他是龙领主最后的真正后裔。Acastus在泰莱亚广受尊敬，他是五位神中最智慧的女王Vallus的丈夫。通过某种神奇的魔法壮举，他最近让龙族复活，自第一次战争结束以来一直被认为已经灭绝。他现在寻求重建龙领主的古老秩序，并恢复Mytros城市昔日的荣耀。",
	"Estoria is an ancient stronghold that has resisted centuries of attacks by centaurs, cyclopes, manticores, and other dangers which thrive on the steppes beyond the Arkelon River. The king of Estoria is Pythor, the mightiest of the Five Gods. He rules from his palace at the highest vantage point in the city.": "埃斯托里亚（Estoria）是一座古老的要塞，经受住了世纪以来来自半人马、独眼巨人、蝎尾狮等在阿克隆河（Arkelon River）之外的草原上猖獗的危险生物的攻击。埃斯托里亚的国王是派索尔（Pythor），他是五位神祇中最强大的一位。他统治着这座城市中最高的瞭望点上的宫殿。",
	"From his throne, Pythor can survey the sprawling farmlands of his kingdom to the south and watch vigilantly for any new threats that might emerge from the north. Although the Estorians are considered provincials by the people of Mytros, everyone knows that the greatest warriors and adventurers of this age are forged in the service of the Lord of Battle.": "从他的王座上，皮索尔(Pythor)可以俯瞰他的王国向南延伸的农田，并警惕地观察可能从北方出现的任何新威胁。尽管埃斯托里亚人(Estorians)被迈特洛斯(Mytros)人视为乡下人，但每个人都知道，这个时代最伟大的战士和冒险家是在为战斗之神的服务中锻造出来的。",

	"The kingdom of Aresia has long been a rival to the kingdom of Mytros. The two cities have been engaged in dozens of wars over the last several hundred years, which are collectively known as the Aresian campaigns. The reasons for the fighting vary, but one thing is certain: warriors on both sides seek glory in battle.": "阿瑞西亚王国长期以来一直是迈特洛斯王国的竞争对手。在过去几百年里，这两个城市已经参与了数十场战争，这些战争被统称为阿瑞西亚战役。战斗的原因各不相同，但有一点是肯定的：双方的战士都在战斗中寻求荣耀。",
	"The warrior monks of the eastern shore are amongst the most feared fighters in all of Thylea. Their children begin training with spears from the day they take their first steps, and every adult is required to serve in the militia. Aresians spend their lives in pursuit of 'degrees' in schools of martial philosophy, which have been refined over many centuries of defending their borders.": "东海岸的武士僧侣是蒂莱亚大陆上最令人畏惧的战士之一。他们的孩子从学步起就开始用长矛训练，每个成年人都必须在民兵中服役。阿瑞西亚人一生都在追求在武学哲学学派中的“位阶”，这些学派经过多个世纪的完善，用来保卫他们的边境。",
	"Aresian warriors cultivate an air of rugged austerity out of a sense of pride in their history, but it disguises long hours spent on beauty rituals, poetry readings, and decadent feasting. The most powerful families in Aresia are those which take the greatest pains to appear ascetic—eating unspiced gruel and wearing little to nothing in public, while lavishing fine foods and luxurious garments on their servants in paradoxical and conspicuous displays of wealth. The highest caste warriors make a point of leading lifestyles that most closely resemble those of their hard-pressed ancestors.": "阿瑞西亚(Aresia)的战士们培养出一种粗犷朴素的氛围，出于对自己历史的骄傲，但这掩盖了他们长时间花在美容仪式、诗歌朗诵和奢华盛宴上。在阿瑞西亚，最有权势的家族是那些竭力表现出禁欲主义的家族——在公共场合吃着无味的粥，穿着几乎赤裸，却在仆人身上奢侈地挥霍着美食和奢华服饰，这种矛盾而显眼的财富展示。最高阶层的战士们特意过着最像他们辛苦祖先生活的生活方式。",
	"For millennia before the coming of the Dragonlords, outsiders would occasionally wash up on the shores of Thylea. These were usually shipwrecked explorers or merchants who were blown far off course. Of all races and nationalities, these people had to live in harmony with the natives of Thylea. They formed tribes and lived on the islands of the Cerulean Gulf. When the Dragonlords came, these tribes fought with the natives of Thylea against the newcomers. In present times the barbarians are still looked upon with fear and distrust by the civilized races. They are seen as being as dangerous as the centaur tribes or fey creatures of the Oldwood. The most feared of the barbarian tribes are the Amazons that dwell upon the island of Themis.": "在龙领主们到来之前的数千年里，外来者偶尔会漂到泰莱亚的海岸上。这些人通常是遭遇船难的探险家或商人，被远远吹离了原定航线。这些人来自各种种族和国籍，他们不得不与泰莱亚的土著和谐共处。他们组成部落，居住在蔚蓝海湾的岛屿上。当龙领主们到来时，这些部落与泰莱亚的土著一起对抗新来者。在现今，文明种族仍然对野蛮人部落心存恐惧和不信任。他们被视为和半人马部落或者老树林中的精灵生物一样危险。最令人畏惧的野蛮人部落是居住在忒弥斯岛上的亚马逊人。",

An oath of peace is central to the story presented in this book.": "和平誓约是指一种强大生物或国王要求宣誓者不得对其或其仆人实施任何暴力行为的誓约。这种誓约几乎总是有一个时间限制。有时限制可以是几周或几个月，但有时可能是几年甚至几个世纪。和平誓约是这本书中故事的核心。",
	"An oath of protection is one in which a powerful individual is sworn to come to the aid of another in a time of great need. One of the most famous of these oaths in mythology is the oath that the Achaean kings swore to Menelaus, husband of Helen. The kings swore to assist Menelaus if anyone ever threatened Helen.

	"An oath of protection requires the swearer to answer a call for aid as quickly as possible. Once the threat has been neutralized, the oath is fulfilled, and there is no further obligation.

	"An oath of service is an oath sworn by one individual to another. The swearer is required to perform one task, which does not need to be specified when the oath is sworn. Unlike the oath of protection, this task could be of any type: it may even require evil deeds, such as assassination. For this reason, most people are hesistant to ever swear such an oath, viewing it as a last resort.": "服务誓约是一个人向另一个人宣誓的誓约。宣誓者需要执行一个任务，当宣誓时不需要具体指定。与保护誓约不同，这个任务可以是任何类型：甚至可能需要邪恶的行为，比如刺杀。因此，大多数人都不愿意宣誓这样的誓约，将其视为最后的手段。",
	"When the oath swearer is called upon, they must answer as quickly as possible. Once the task has been completed, the oath is fulfilled and there is no further obligation.

	"While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores all other charm effects. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet from the harpy, they must attempt to move toward the harpy by the most direct route.

	"A person cursed in this fashion will slowly transform into a medusa.

	"This curse afflicts those who abuse guest friendship or break powerful oaths. Those who violate the tenets of guest friendship are at risk of being cursed by the offended host or guest.

The effect of this curse is directly related to the injustice of the offense.": "这种诅咒会影响那些滥用客人友谊或违背强大誓言的人。那些违反客人友谊准则的人有可能会被冒犯的主人或客人诅咒。违背对神明所立誓言几乎总会导致犯错的凡人受到诅咒，但一个人也可能因为违背对尤为强大的国王，甚至虔诚的乞丐所立誓言而受到诅咒。这种诅咒的效果与冒犯行为的不公正程度直接相关。",

	"The future of Thylea looks grim. Monsters menace the roads, and corruption threatens the cities.

	"These hunters are recovering from minor injuries sustained while hunting the boar. They set a trap for the beast by laying twenty pounds of rotten fruit in the middle of a field and hiding in the surrounding hedges. The boar took them by surprise.

They tried to follow but the sounds were too horrible, and so they came here to drink to the memory of their dead friend.": "这些猎人正在康复，他们在狩猎野猪时受了轻伤。他们设下陷阱，将二十磅腐烂水果摆放在田野中央，并藏在周围的树篱中。野猪出乎意料地袭击了他们。它用獠牙刺伤了他们的一个朋友，并将他拖入树林。他们试图跟随，但声音太可怕了，所以他们来到这里，为了纪念他们已故的朋友而饮酒。",

	"Kyrah will not fight in any of the heroes' battles. She will stay away from enemies and make meticulous notes for an epic poem about the struggle.

The long years have not been kind to the god-king.

Gaius will only agree to a substitution if all of the heroes agree to be sacrificed together.": "然而，如果任何英雄提出自己作为替代者，盖乌斯会改变主意。如果他们没有考虑到这一点，在他们离开之前，他会提出这个建议。他知道赛登希望看到神谕选民被杀，把他们献祭在埃斯托岩石上将是一个合适的方式。只有当所有英雄同意一起被牺牲时，盖乌斯才会同意替换。",

	"The Great Falls are almost beyond description. It's as if an entire ocean has spilled over the edge of the world, and you stand marveling at the space beyond. You have never seen anything so grand. The sound of rushing water is almost deafening, and the light of the fading day gleams across the water like red gold.": "大瀑布几乎无法用言语描述。就像整个海洋倾泻到世界的边缘一样，你站在那里惊叹着远处的景色。你从未见过如此壮观的景象。奔流的水声几乎震耳欲聋，夕阳的余晖在水面上闪耀着红金般的光芒。",
	"Four massive statues of stone hands surround the lake. To the south, you can see the river snaking down from the mountains, through the Oldwoods, while the snowcapped Mithral Mountains dominate the western horizon.": "四座巨大的石手雕像环绕着湖泊。向南，你可以看到一条河流从山脉中蜿蜒而下，穿过(Oldwoods)，而雪顶的(Mithral Mountains)主宰着西方的地平线。",
	"A wooded path descends down to the misty riverbank, where the collapsed entrance to the mines can be seen. A secret pathway into the mines can be found here with a trivial investigation.": "一条木栈道蜿蜒而下，通往雾气蒙蒙的河岸，可以看到矿井的倒塌入口。在这里进行简单的调查可以发现通往矿井的秘密路径。",
	"The lake is flanked by four massive statues of hands, two per side. These are the {@creature Hands of Kentimane|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}, the Elder Titan, but they are dormant for now.": "湖泊两侧各有四座巨大的手雕像，每侧两座。这些是{@creature Hands of Kentimane|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}，即上古泰坦，但它们目前处于休眠状态。",
	"The main entrance to the mines is blocked by tons of rubble and is completely inaccessible. This was done by the dwarves when they fled from the cerberus hound, as they hoped to keep the beast sealed away.": "矿井的主入口被数吨的瓦砾堵塞，完全无法进入。这是矮人们在逃离犬头怪时所做的，他们希望将野兽封印起来。",
	"This rocky ledge leads up from the riverbank and passes through a short tunnel, which deflects an endless cascade of water from the Great Falls. The ledge grows narrower as it ascends, stretching for a quarter-mile along a sheer cliff of slick black rock. Beyond the ledge, a shimmering curtain of translucent water spills down to crash on the rocks below. Cold white mist fogs your vision, and roaring water drowns out all other sound.": "这块岩石岩脊从河岸上延伸，穿过一个短隧道，使来自大瀑布的无尽瀑布水流偏转。随着上升，岩脊变得越来越窄，沿着一条光滑的黑色岩壁绵延四分之一英里。在岩脊之外，一道闪亮的半透明水帘倾泻而下，砰然撞击下方的岩石。冰冷的白雾模糊了你的视线，轰鸣的水声淹没了一切其他声音。",
	"This path leads under the waterfall. Anyone walking along it is sprayed with water from the falls. Wet moss covers the sides, though the path itself is well used and relatively safe. This is the main path used by troglodytes to go hunting at night. There is a rope ladder that leads down to the river below that troglodytes use when they go fishing. This pathway was carved into the cliffside centuries ago when the dwarves were first exploring the natural caves behind the waterfall.": "这条路径通向瀑布下方。沿着它走的人会被瀑布的水花打湿。湿润的苔藓覆盖着两侧，但路径本身被广泛使用，相对安全。这是穴居人夜间狩猎时使用的主要路径。有一把绳梯通向下方的河流，穴居人在去钓鱼时会使用。这条路径是几个世纪前由矮人首次探索瀑布背后的天然洞穴时雕刻而成的。",
	"A stink wafts up from below as four filthy-looking humanoids clamber onto the path ahead. Each carries a net full of wriggling fish. Upon seeing you, the trogloytes drop their fish and chatter to each other. The stench is nearly overwhelming. You notice a hungry gleam in their eyes.": "四个看起来肮脏的人形生物从下方爬上来，一股臭味从下方飘了上来。每个人形生物都背着装满扭动着的鱼的网。当他们看到你时，那些洞穴人放下手中的鱼，互相交谈着。恶臭几乎让人难以忍受。你注意到他们眼中闪烁着饥饿的光芒。",

	"This natural tunnel runs for fifty feet at a slight incline. The floor is wet and moss grows along the walls and ceiling. The floor is well-used, covered in the tracks of the foul creatures from the waterfall. The tunnel eventually forks. To the left, the tunnel continues into a network of natural caves. A terrible stench comes from this direction, along with echoing shrieks of pain and horror. To the right, the tunnel becomes a stonework passageway.": "这条自然隧道呈轻微倾斜，全长五十英尺。地面潮湿，墙壁和天花板上长满了苔藓。地面被频繁使用，覆盖着从瀑布来的邪恶生物的足迹。隧道最终分岔。向左，隧道通往一系列天然洞穴。从这个方向传来一股可怕的恶臭，伴随着痛苦和恐惧的尖叫回荡。向右，隧道变成了一条石制通道。",
	"This corridor is heavily used.

	"The tunnel descends into the earth. Out of the darkness rises a stench worse than anything you have ever known. The shrieking sound from deep within the caves suddenly ceases.": "隧道向地下延伸。在黑暗中升起一股比你以往所知更糟糕的恶臭。深处洞穴传来的尖叫声突然停止了。",
	"The cave entrance is guarded by four {@creature troglodyte|MM|troglodytes}.

	"The troglodytes here are foul creatures that came from the deep regions of the Underdark, far below the sunlit lands of Thylea. They were driven to the surface by the same primordial creature that killed the cerberus hound. Now, they hunt for food on the surface at night. While they dine mainly on fish, they consider the tortured flesh of centaurs and civilized folk to be delicacies.": "这里的穴居人是来自地下深处的恶物，远在太阳光普照的锡莱亚大地之下。它们被同一原始生物驱赶到地表，这个生物也杀死了地狱三头犬。现在，它们在夜晚在地表上寻找食物。虽然它们主要以鱼为食，但它们认为半人马和文明人的折磨肉是美味佳肴。",

	"Troglodytes like to attack by stealth, using their chameleon skin to merge into the walls of the Mithral Mines. Typically, one troglodyte will grapple a victim at the start of combat so that the victim's companions have to choose to abandon their friend if they flee.": "穴居人喜欢通过隐秘方式发动攻击，利用它们的变色龙皮融入到秘银矿洞的墙壁中。通常，一名穴居人会在战斗开始时与受害者搏斗，这样受害者的同伴们在逃跑时不得不选择是抛弃朋友还是留下来帮助。",

	"This stonework tunnel ends at the precipice of a huge natural rift in the earth. The rocky ceiling is only twenty feet above you, but the rift drops away into a fathomless black depth. Veins of silvery ore can be seen in the sides of the shaft. Ancient mining equipment lines the walls, but the wooden platforms and walkways are rotten and unusable. Chains are attached to the ceiling of the shaft in a pulley system that used to lift ore from the depths. Most of the chains are rusted and many have broken. The area around you has been scored by gouges in the stone, as if some giant claw once reached out of the pit.": "这条石制隧道尽头是一个巨大的自然裂缝，地面陡峭。岩石天花板离你只有二十英尺，但裂缝向下延伸至无底的黑暗深渊。在洞穴的侧面可以看到银色矿脉。古老的采矿设备沿着墙壁排列，但木制平台和人行道已经腐烂无法使用。链条连接在洞穴天花板上，曾经用于提升深处的矿石。大部分链条已经生锈，很多已经断裂。你周围的区域被石头上的凹痕刻上，仿佛曾经有一只巨大的爪子伸出深渊。",
	"There is nothing living here, but it has an ominous feel to it. There used to be wooden platforms that allowed dwarves to mine the mithral and adamantine, but most are gone and anything that remains is unusable.

	"There is an entrance to the second level 100 ft. down the shaft, but the only way to reach it is to climb the sheer face of the shaft. Doing so requires three successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks. Someone who manages this could use pitons and rope to create an easier path for everyone else.": "在距离地面100英尺的深坑里有通往第二层的入口，但唯一到达它的方法是攀爬深坑的陡峭表面。这需要成功通过三次DC 15力量（体操）检定。成功的角色可以使用短铁钉和绳索为其他人创造更容易的路径。",

	"Falling to the bottom inflicts 70 ({@damage 20d6}) bludgeoning damage. Every round spent in the gas-filled cavern requires a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned.

What lies beyond the lake is outside the scope of this book.": "掉落到底部会造成70 ({@damage 20d6}) 钝击伤害。在充满毒气的洞穴中度过的每一轮都需要进行一次DC 10的体质豁免才能避免中毒。这实际上是通往地下世界的入口，通往一片岩浆湖。湖的彼岸超出了本书的范围。",

	"I will tell you what I know of Damon. He drank knowledge like others drank wine, and his eyes were like portals into the depths of time.

He may use spells such as hold person and wall of force to prevent a battle, if the heroes are stupid enough to attack him.": "他现在是一名巫妖。死城被认为是他的巢穴，他将是英雄们极具挑战性的对手。如果英雄们愚蠢到攻击他，他可能会使用诸如定身术和力场墙之类的法术来阻止战斗。",

You have heard rumors of the dragons of Mytros, but these creatures are far more splendid than you imagined. The dragons are ridden by red-cloaked knights: high ranking centurions from the city. The dragons descend and touch down several dozen yards away. Three knights with shields and swords dismount and approach you. The determined look in their eyes suggests that they have been sent here with a mission, but they clearly mean you no harm. Their leader steps forward and introduces himself, \"I am Tarchon.

The towers that flank the gate are carved to represent the writhing forms of dozens of dragons.": "这座巨大的门可以从蜿蜒上山的铺砌道路进入。这条道路宽阔到足以容纳双向交通。守卫门两侧的塔楼被雕刻成数十条蛇形龙的形态。",

	"But something is wrong. Massive, swirling black clouds loom over the city, the wind battering its ships and tearing at its banners.

	"Glancing up into the sky, you notice that something ominous has materialized within the spinning eye of the hurricane. It's the scowling visage of Sydon, Lord of Storms. His angry eyes rove the city, until they abruptly lock onto your exact position. The titan conjures a crackling white bolt of lightning and hurls it at you.": "抬头望向天空，你注意到飓风旋眼中出现了一些不祥的东西。那是风暴之神赛登（Sydon）的愤怒面容。他愤怒的眼神扫视着城市，直到突然锁定在你的准确位置。巨人制造出一道闪耀的白色闪电，并将其投向你。",
	"Have the heroes roll for initiative. Whoever rolls the lowest is immediately struck by the bolt of lightning, which hits with the same effects as a {@spell lightning bolt} spell.

	"At this point, you may choose to allow the heroes to explore the City of Mytros, but the storms make it difficult to do much of anything beyond visit local landmarks.

	"If Acastus is ever asked about where he found the dragon eggs that have allowed him to revive the Dragonlords, he will lie. He says that he sent heroes to explore Thylea a decade ago in an attempt to find dragon eggs.

	"First, the king wonders whether the heroes can {@bold stop the storm with magic.} He has heard that there are powerful spells that may be used to alter the weather. Surely if the rumors about the heroes are true, then they should be mighty enough to command such magic?": "首先，国王想知道英雄们是否能够{@bold stop the storm with magic.} 他听说有强大的咒语可以用来改变天气。如果关于英雄的传言是真的，那么他们应该足够强大来驾驭这样的魔法吧？",
	"Acastus refers to the 8th level spell {@spell control weather}, which the heroes probably cannot cast. However, if the party has collected two sets of nymph-hair strings, then they can craft the Boreal harp at the Mithral Forge. In this case, a bard will be capable of casting the spell, but Acastus is impatient, so the harp must have been created before they answer the summons to Mytros.": "阿卡斯托斯指的是第8级法术{@spell control weather}，英雄们可能无法施展。然而，如果队伍收集了两套女仙头发编织的琴弦，他们就可以在秘银熔炉打造北境竖琴。在这种情况下，一个诗人就能够施展这个法术，但阿卡斯托斯很着急，所以竖琴必须在他们回应迈特洛斯的召唤之前制作好。",
	"When it becomes clear that the heroes cannot use magic, the king feigns disappointment. If the heroes chose not to sacrifice the great boar to Sydon earlier in the story, Acastus may also wonder aloud at their wisdom in making such a decision.": "当英雄们无法使用魔法时，国王假装失望。如果英雄们在故事早期选择不牺牲伟大野猪给(Sydon)，阿卡斯特斯也许会对他们做出这样的决定的智慧表示怀疑。",
	"Gaius angrily demands that the king {@bold dismantle the Temple of the Five} and smash every stone to dust. Sydon abhors the worship of other gods, and especially worship of the Five. Gaius has argued for decades that the Temple of the Five should be destroyed, but the idea has recently gained some popular support. If Gaius is to be believed, smashing the temple is the only way to appease the Lord of Storms.": "盖乌斯愤怒地要求国王{@bold dismantle the Temple of the Five}并将每块石头粉碎成尘。西顿厌恶对其他神灵的崇拜，尤其是对五位神灵的崇拜。盖乌斯数十年来一直主张摧毁五神殿，但这个想法最近获得了一些民众的支持。如果盖乌斯所说属实，摧毁神殿是安抚风暴之主的唯一途径。",
	"Gaius is also contemptuous of both the heroes and Queen Vallus. She is, after all, one of the Five Gods and the daughter of the patron god of the city. As the commander of the Order of Sydon, Gaius believes that the city must abandon its worship of the Five, and stop putting any faith in these \"puppets of the Oracle.\"": "盖乌斯对英雄和女王瓦卢斯也持轻蔑态度。毕竟，她是五位神祇之一，也是这座城市守护神的女儿。作为赛登骑士团的指挥官，盖乌斯认为这座城市必须放弃对五位神祇的崇拜，不再对这些“神谕的傀儡”抱有信仰。",
	"If the heroes choose to order the destruction of the Temple of the Five, then the gods will grudgingly accept this course of action. Vallus and Kyrah have long believed that it was inevitable that their power would wane and that the people of Mytros would lose faith, but they had hoped that it would not happen in such a fashion. However, this loss of worship still causes pain to the Five. As a result of the temple's destruction, Kyrah, Vallus, Pythor, and Volkan will become dispirited and suffer one level of permanent exhaustion.": "如果英雄们选择摧毁五神殿，那么众神将勉强接受这一行动。瓦卢斯(Vallus)和凯拉(Kyrah)长期以来一直相信，他们的力量将不可避免地衰退，而密特洛斯(Mytros)的人民将失去信仰，但他们希望这不会以这种方式发生。然而，这种崇拜的流失仍然给五神带来痛苦。由于神殿的毁灭，凯拉、瓦卢斯、皮索(Pythor)和沃尔坎(Volkan)将变得意志消沉，并遭受一级永久性疲惫。",
	"Chondrus argues that Sydon can only be placated by the intervention of Lutheria, his sister-wife. To gain her help the king should {@bold order seventy children of the city to \"take the black robes\"} and dedicate themselves to the Cult of Lutheria. He promises that the Lady of Dreams will treat the children well—they will eat the finest of foods and drink the sweetest of wines.": "Chondrus认为只有通过他的姐妹妻子Lutheria的干预，Sydon才能被安抚。为了获得她的帮助，国王应该{@bold order seventy children of the city to \"take the black robes\"}并且致力于Lutheria的教派。他承诺梦境女士会善待孩子们——他们将享用最美味的食物和喝到最甜美的葡萄酒。",
	"In fact, they will all be sacrificed in the cult's perverse blood rituals. Everyone suspects this and hates the suggestion. Queen Vallus would have Chondrus killed before she would allow it to happen.": "事实上，他们都将在邪恶的教派血腥仪式中被牺牲。每个人都怀疑这一点，并憎恨这种建议。女王瓦卢斯(Queen Vallus)宁愿让钦德鲁斯(Chondrus)被杀，也不会允许这种事情发生。",
	"Chondrus appears later in the adventure on the Island of Yonder. He hopes to convince the heroes to bargain with Lutheria. If the heroes manage to turn the king against him, he will use {@spell dimension door} to escape back to his lair.": "Chondrus在《Yonder岛》冒险中稍后出现。他希望说服英雄们与Lutheria讨价还价。如果英雄们设法让国王反对他，他将使用{@spell dimension door}逃回自己的巢穴。",
	"In normal circumstances, Bella should have no voice in this matter, but the king indulges her. She innocently asks why the usual solution has not been tried. Normally, the priests of Sydon sacrifice dozens of animals to placate the storm god. Acastus explains that for a storm like this one, they would need to {@bold perform a hecatomb, a sacrifice of 100 oxen.} This would require half the livestock in the city, and it would cost about 10,000 gp. Perhaps the heroes might pay the cost? The royal coffers cannot afford such an expense...": "在正常情况下，贝拉（Bella）不应该在这件事上发表意见，但国王却纵容她。她天真地问为什么没有尝试通常的解决方案。通常，赛登（Sydon）的祭司们会献祭数十只动物来安抚风暴之神。阿卡斯塔斯（Acastus）解释说，对于像这样的风暴，他们需要 {@bold perform a hecatomb, a sacrifice of 100 oxen.} 这将需要城市一半的牲畜，大约需要花费1万金币。也许英雄们可以支付这笔费用？皇家金库无法承担这样的开支...",
	"Queen Vallus suddenly stands up from her throne and approaches you directly, ignoring the protests of the king. She radiates a sense of profound intellect and divine beauty.": "女王瓦卢斯突然从王座上站起来，直接走向你，无视国王的抗议。她散发出一种深邃智慧和神圣美丽的气质。",

	"If the heroes choose this course of action, then Vallus calls Kyrah, Pythor, and Volkan into the throne room. The heroes must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Alternatively, you can simply roleplay this encounter by having each hero make a separate plea to the gods.": "如果英雄们选择这个行动方向，那么瓦卢斯将召唤凯拉(Kyrah)、皮索(Pythor)和沃尔坎(Volkan)进入王座室。英雄们必须在一个DC 16的魅力（说服）检定中成功。或者，您也可以通过让每位英雄向众神单独陈诉来扮演这场遭遇。",

	"Before the heroes leave the Great Palace, Queen Vallus sends her chief stewardess, Makhaira, to intercept them as they are leaving the throne room. Makhaira escorts the heroes to see the queen in her chambers.": "在英雄们离开大皇宫之前，女王瓦卢斯派遣她的首席女管家，马凯拉，去拦截他们，当他们离开王座厅时。马凯拉护送英雄们去见女王在她的房间里。",
	"When the heroes arrive, Queen Vallus is resting on a divan across from a series of gilded mirrors. She is accompanied by many scribes and servants in white. While Acastus is off playing king, Vallus works hard behind closed doors, performing the many necessary duties of a true head of state.": "当英雄们到达时，瓦卢斯女王(Queen Vallus)正躺在一张长椅上，对面是一排镀金镜子。她身边有许多穿着白色服装的抄写员和仆人。当阿卡斯塔斯(Acastus)在外面扮演国王时，瓦卢斯女王在闭门之后努力工作，履行一个真正的国家元首的许多必要职责。",
	"The queen's chief stewardess is {@bold Makhaila} (LG {@creature amazon warrior|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}), who commands twelve {@creature amazon warrior|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|amazon warriors}.

	"Vallus explains that her husband has not been entirely honest with the party. The map to the {@italic Ultros} is accurate, but the king is almost certainly sending the heroes to their doom. She knows that Acastus has been troubled in his sleep by dreams of some kind, and she thinks that his unusual generosity is somehow connected to this. He would never give the heroes such a gift unless he believed that it would work to his advantage.": "瓦卢斯解释说，她的丈夫并没有完全诚实地对待这支队伍。前往{@italic Ultros}的地图是准确的，但国王几乎肯定是在送英雄们上死路。她知道阿卡斯托斯一直被某种梦境困扰着，她认为他的异常慷慨与此有关。除非他相信这会对他有利，否则他绝不会给英雄们这样的礼物。",

She feels that nothing good can come of Acastus controlling both the ship and the dragons.": "Vallus坚持认为，当英雄们获得了Ultros后，他们应立即返回找她。她确信她那个“愚蠢的丈夫”会试图拿走这艘船。她觉得如果Acastus控制了船和龙，将不会有任何好事发生。",
	"Vallus also explains that there are deep conflicts within the city between the followers of the Five and the followers of the Titans. She has some suspicions about what the Titans want. You can decide if your players need to hear anything of the history of the Titans at this point, or whether this would only muddy the waters for them. She is desperately worried that, at the time when the Oath of Peace ends, the powers of the Five Gods will be fully spent. If Pythor or Kyrah are present, she will also be concerned for them, and will make a point of asking after the health of Volkan, her father.": "Vallus（瓦卢斯）还解释说，城市内部存在着五神信徒和泰坦信徒之间的深刻冲突。她对泰坦的意图有一些怀疑。你可以决定你的玩家是否需要在这个时候听到有关泰坦历史的任何信息，或者这只会让他们更加困惑。她担心，当和平誓约结束时，五位神祇的力量将会耗尽。如果Pythor（皮索尔）或Kyrah（凯拉）在场，她也会为他们担心，并会特意询问她的父亲Volkan（沃尔坎）的健康状况。",

	"Vallus asks the heroes for a favor. Sydon may have been pacified this time, but the Titans should pay a price for their cruelty and impudence. While attacking the Temple of Sydon would be too much of a provocation, the Cult of Lutheria is gaining a dangerous amount of influence in the city. Vallus asks the heroes to help the city by striking a blow against the cult.": "瓦卢斯请求英雄们帮个忙。赛登这次可能已经被平息了，但泰坦们应该为他们的残忍和傲慢付出代价。虽然攻击赛登神殿会太过激，但卢瑟莉亚教派在城市中获得了危险的影响力。瓦卢斯请求英雄们帮助城市，打击这个教派。",
	"The queen suggests that the heroes should investigate the {@italic Temple of Lutheria} ({@area M20|M20|x}) in {@italic Stygian Row}.

	"Although Icarus has the body of an adult dragon, he has the callow mind of a twenty year-old wyrmling. Gaius's silver dragon, Argyn, is the same. Twenty years ago, when Acastus became King of Mytros, Lutheria gave him several {@item dragon egg|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|dragon eggs}, along with {@item potion of aging|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|potions of aging} to feed the dragons in order to accelerate their growth. Both Icarus and Argyn were hatched and raised in this way.": "尽管伊卡鲁斯拥有成年龙的身体，但他的心智却像一个二十岁的幼龙。盖乌斯的白银龙，阿尔金，也是如此。二十年前，当阿卡斯塔斯成为迈特洛斯之王时，卢瑟里亚给了他几个{@item dragon egg|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|dragon eggs}，以及{@item potion of aging|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|potions of aging}来喂养龙，以加快它们的成长速度。伊卡鲁斯和阿尔金都是这样孵化和抚养的。",

	"The dragon's treasure pile contains 20,000 sp. He will awaken immediately if even a single coin is touched, but his first instinct is not to be angry. He likes it when people admire his treasure, and he will allow each hero to take as much as 25 sp, because he likes to feel generous and lordly. However, if the heroes attempt to take more than the few coins he allows them, he will grow annoyed and call for guards to escort them away.": "龙的宝藏堆中包含20,000 sp。即使触碰到一枚硬币，他都会立即苏醒，但他的第一反应并不是生气。他喜欢人们欣赏他的财宝，他会允许每位英雄拿走多达25 sp，因为他喜欢感觉慷慨和高贵。然而，如果英雄们试图拿走超过他允许的几枚硬币，他会变得恼火，并召唤卫兵把他们护送离开。",
	"Now that the heroes have solved the king's dilemma and learned of the whereabouts of the Ultros, they are free to explore Mytros. They can attempt to recover the Ultros, participate in the Great Games, or investigate other strange events in the city.": "现在英雄们已经解决了国王的困境并了解到了乌尔特洛斯((Ultros))的下落，他们可以自由探索迈特洛斯(Mytros)。他们可以尝试找回乌尔特洛斯((Ultros))，参加盛大比赛，或调查城市中的其他奇怪事件。",

	"The hills above the harbor provide views that reach as far as the Mithral Mountains and the Oldwoods. These two hills are where the most important buildings are located.

	"Mytros is mostly a beautiful and clean city. The streets are cleaned every night, and the citizens frown upon those who allow their mounts to defecate in the streets.

	"Many of the greatest structures in the city are built entirely from marble, inlaid with bronze, adorned with painted tiles and beautiful mosaics.

	"The Cult of Lutheria is the oldest cult in Mytros. The cultists are unabashed worshippers of the Lady of Dreams.

On the other hand, if she is wrong and the sphinx actually did intend to return the boy, then the sphinx must keep him, even though he did not intend to do so, thereby also breaking his word.": "然而，如果她回答说狮身人面像不会把孩子还给他，我们就陷入了悖论：如果她是对的，狮身人面像从未打算把孩子还给她，那么狮身人面像必须还孩子，但这样做，他就违背了自己的承诺，与母亲的回答相矛盾。另一方面，如果她错了，狮身人面像实际上是打算把男孩还回去的，那么狮身人面像必须留下他，即使他并没有打算这样做，也违背了自己的承诺。",
	"What is the nature of good and evil? Are they metaphysical properties that can be measured or changed? For example, if a man commits murder, his neighbors may call him evil. We may rightly say that he has evil properties. Hoping to atone for his act, this man may offer to pay the victim's family gold pieces to compensate for their loss. Now, let us say that the victim's family is satisfied by the payment, and they forgive him, saying that he is no longer evil. The man had evil properties before he made the payment, but now he does not.": "善恶的本质是什么？它们是可以衡量或改变的形而上属性吗？例如，如果一个人犯了谋杀罪，他的邻居们可能会称他为邪恶。我们可以说他具有邪恶的属性。希望赎罪的这个人可能会提出支付金币给受害者家人，以弥补他们的损失。现在，让我们假设受害者的家人对这笔赔偿感到满意，并原谅了他，称他不再邪恶。这个人在支付赔偿之前具有邪恶的属性，但现在不再具有。",
	"If properties of objects cannot be created or destroyed but merely transferred, where did the evil properties go? Are the coins now evil? Is the family evil?": "如果物体的属性不能被创造或摧毁，只能转移，那么邪恶的属性去了哪里？现在硬币是邪恶的吗？家族是邪恶的吗？",

	"Taran explains that the Lady is cursed—she is a medusa who petrifies anyone who crosses her. Further, he explains that minotaurs are violent beasts with limited intelligence who revel in bloodshed, and the fact that the Lady of Coins has an affinity for them speaks volumes about her character. Taran also suspects that she is behind the Cult of the Snake, a thieves' guild deeply involved with smuggling and murder.": "Taran解释说，这位女士被诅咒了——她是一个美杜莎，会石化任何冒犯她的人。此外，他解释说，牛头怪是暴力的野兽，智力有限，热衷于杀戮，而财币女士对它们有好感，这说明了她的性格。Taran还怀疑她是蛇之教会的幕后黑手，这是一个与走私和谋杀有深度牵连的盗贼行会。",

	"The {@creature ghost|MM} of {@bold Metron} the thane is in here. One of the hammocks obviously sags more than the others when the heroes enter and then, a round later, Metron will fade into sight, though he will remain in the border of the ethereal plane.

He explains that whoever performs most admirably will take his place as the new captain of the ship.": "在宣誓之后，埃斯托尔宣布他的船员中有三名叛徒。他让英雄们找出这些叛变的幽灵并摧毁它们。在这件事完成之前，他不会让英雄们从梦境中解脱出来。他解释说，表现最出色的人将取代他成为船长。",

	"Accepting the bargain means that the hero's personality immediately changes: they become dangerously cruel and obsessed with achieving immortality, and their alignment shifts to neutral evil.

The yugoloth and the cerberus hounds will attack anyone other than a hag who emerges from the tunnel.": "第三个也是最后一个隧道延伸了一英里，然后通向一个荒凉的废土：这就是哈迪斯（Hades）的领域。 一队十二名{@creature mezzoloth|MM|mezzoloths}，由一个{@creature nycaloth|MM}领导，守护着这个世界之间的入口，目前正在为女巫结社养育两只{@creature cerberus|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}猎犬。女巫们有时会下来这里检查猎犬的进展，或者与犹格洛斯（yugoloths）交易获取更多幼虫。犹格洛斯和地狱三头犬会攻击除女巫以外的任何人从隧道出来的人。",
	"This cave is at the highest point on the island.": "这个洞穴位于岛上的最高点。",
	"High up, near the top of the mountain, you come across a cave. Bones, animal and humanoid, litter the ground near the cave mouth. Most are cracked or shattered into pieces, lining the path into the dark with a sort of macabre gravel. Although the cave is cloaked in shadow, there is a glint of light shining inside.": "在山顶附近，你发现了一个洞穴。洞口附近散落着动物和人类的骨骼，大多数都是破碎的，铺满了通向黑暗深处的道路，形成了一种令人毛骨悚然的鹅卵石。尽管洞穴被阴影笼罩，但里面闪烁着一丝光芒。",
	"The cave is the den for a family of {@creature manticore|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|manticores}. This mated pair and their offspring have served the hags for decades and are well fed and groomed. They are larger than typical manticores (98 hit points each).": "这个洞穴是{@creature manticore|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|manticores}家族的巢穴。这对配偶和他们的后代已经为女巫效劳了几十年，它们被喂养得很好，也被梳理得整洁。它们比典型的蝎狮要大（每只98点生命值）。",
	"They have a brood of four smaller {@creature manticore|MM|manticores}. These siblings hate each other, and only return to the cave occasionally. You can add them to the encounter if you wish to increase the danger and tension.": "他们有一窝四只更小的{@creature manticore|MM|manticores}。这些兄弟姐妹彼此仇恨，只偶尔返回洞穴。如果你希望增加危险和紧张感，可以将它们添加到遭遇中。",
	"Over the years the manticores have gathered treasure from passing ships. Scattered amongst the bones are 1,100 sp, 650 gp, two matched platinum goblets worth 400 gp each, and a necklace of sapphires worth 1,500 gp.": "多年来，蝎尾狮( manticores) 从经过的船只那里收集了财宝。在骨头之间散落着1,100 sp，650 gp，两只价值400 gp 的匹配铂金高脚杯，以及价值1,500 gp 的蓝宝石项链。",
	"This crumbling tower is built to a scale far larger than normal human proportions. The civilization that built it must have been giants. The skeletal remains of the former inhabitants are scattered throughout the ruins. In addition to their great size, these skeletons all have skulls with a single central eye socket and six arms.": "这座摇摇欲坠的塔楼建造得比普通人类比例大得多。建造它的文明一定是巨人。这座废墟中散落着先前居民的骨骸遗骸。除了它们巨大的尺寸外，这些骷髅还都有一个中央眼窝和六只胳膊。",

	"Inside the tower is a bronze chest that has been broken open. It has obviously been looted at some point in the past, but it still contains a number of large scroll cases.": "塔内有一个被打开的青铜箱子。很明显它曾经被洗劫过，但里面仍然装着几个大卷轴盒。",
	"The scrolls detail the history of the war between the Dragonlords and the Gygan Empire. This account paints the Dragonlords as brutal oppressors who wiped out the Gygans without a shred of mercy.": "这些卷轴详细记录了龙领主与吉甘帝国之间的战争历史。这份记载将龙领主描绘成了残暴的压制者，毫不留情地消灭了吉甘人。",
	"Although the sea is calm, finding a safe place to come ashore on this rocky island is a difficult task. There is one obvious place to make landfall: a stone dock on the island's only beach. A lone figure stands upon the dock, watching warily as your ship approaches. Vegetation grows by the shore, but there are no trees.": "尽管海面平静，但在这个多岩石的岛屿上找到一个安全的上岸地点是一项艰巨的任务。有一个明显的地方可以登陆：岛上唯一的海滩上有一个石头码头。一个孤独的身影站在码头上，警惕地注视着你的船靠近。岸边长满了植物，但没有树木。",

	"Criminals from Mytros accused of heinous crimes (such as murder) are sometimes exiled to this island for the rest of their lives. Mytrosian justice also allows for powerful citizens to be exiled by popular consent. When this happens, the exiles are ferried to the island, where they must remain for at least a decade.": "从米特洛斯（Mytros）被指控犯有严重罪行（如谋杀）的罪犯有时会被流放到这个岛屿，终身驻留。米特洛斯的司法制度也允许强大的公民根据民意被流放。当这种情况发生时，这些被流放者会被渡到这个岛上，他们必须至少在那里呆上十年。",
	"The sailing route to the island is a well-kept secret known only to King Acastus and his closest advisors. This is not a secret that Acastus shares with the heroes, as too many of his personal enemies are on the rocky island. The island has no large trees for good reason: no trees mean no wood for boat building. The island is mostly covered in bushes and small fig trees which are entirely unsuitable for any nautical purposes.": "前往岛屿的航线是国王阿卡斯托斯和他最亲密的顾问们所独有的秘密。这不是阿卡斯托斯与英雄们分享的秘密，因为太多他的个人敌人在那座多岩石的岛屿上。这座岛屿没有大树是有充分理由的：没有树意味着没有木材用于建造船只。岛上主要覆盖着灌木丛和小无法用于任何航海目的的无花果树。",
	"The only safe way to gain access to the island by ship is to use the stone dock located on the south of the island. Idylla is watching the docks when the heroes arrive. She sends another exile to alert the village.": "通过船只安全抵达岛屿的唯一方式是使用位于岛屿南部的石码头。当英雄们到达时，伊迪拉正在观察码头。她派遣另一名流放者去警告村庄。",

She welcomes them to the island and does everything she can to ingratiate herself.": "艾迪拉立刻意识到{@italic Ultros}不是来自迈特洛斯的监狱船。她希望在村庄的竞争对手有机会见到他们之前向队伍介绍自己。她欢迎他们来到这个岛屿，并尽一切努力讨好他们。",
	"\"Hail, strangers, and well met. Do my eyes deceive me or is that the {@italic Ultros}? You must be great warriors to command such a ship. Welcome to the Island of Exiles. I am called Idylla. Perhaps you have heard of my son—King Acastus of Mytros?\"": "“喂，陌生人，幸会。难道我的眼睛在欺骗我吗，那是{@italic Ultros}吗？你们一定是伟大的战士，才能指挥这样一艘船。欢迎来到流放之岛。我叫伊迪拉(Idylla)。也许你们听说过我的儿子—米特洛斯(Mytros)的国王阿卡斯托斯(Acastus)？”",
	"The exiles and criminals have learned to co-exist, and have built a simple community near the center of the island. It consists of a dozen stone houses and a plain temple to the Five Gods. A well provides fresh water, and several small gardens provide vegetables.": "流亡者和罪犯已经学会共存，并在岛屿中心附近建立了一个简单的社区。这里有十几座石头房屋和一座朴素的神庙，供奉着五位神祇。一口井提供清水，几个小菜园提供蔬菜。",

He decides how to punish those who transgress against the small community's rules.": "这个岛屿的居民是一个折衷的群体，他们已经学会了如何共同生活。每年他们都会选举一个新的“国王”(king)。这位国王是纠纷的调解者。他决定如何惩罚那些违反小社区规则的人。",

	"One of the newer exiles, Stavros has been voted king for the past two years. A charismatic man, Stavros was one of the most successful wine merchants in all of Thylea. He claims to have been exiled by popular vote, but in reality, he was sent to the island for poisoning a rival. Stavros is paranoid that a new prisoner or exile will reveal his lie, but so far, no one has shown up on the island who knows the truth about his past.": "作为较新的流放者之一，Stavros在过去两年里一直被选为国王。Stavros是一个有魅力的人，曾是蒂莱亚最成功的葡萄酒商之一。他声称自己是因为民意投票而被流放，但实际上，他是因为毒死一个竞争对手而被流放到这个岛上的。Stavros担心一个新的囚犯或流放者会揭露他的谎言，但到目前为止，没有人出现在这个岛上知道他过去的真相。",
	"A recluse, Tadd is one of the strangest inhabitants of the island. He has a penchant for talking to himself, randomly screaming obscenities at the gods, and defecating in the middle of conversations. His obvious \"eccentricities\" are overlooked because he is the island's best woodworker, stone mason, and architect. He was sent to the island for murdering six women in Stygian Row. Idylla and the other women of the island hate and fear him for obvious reasons.": "Tadd（塔德）是岛上最奇怪的居民之一，他是一个隐士。他喜欢自言自语，随机对着众神大喊脏话，并且喜欢在谈话中间大便。尽管他明显的“古怪”行为，却被人们忽视了，因为他是岛上最优秀的木匠、石匠和建筑师。他被送到这个岛上是因为在冥河街（Stygian Row）谋杀了六名女性。Idylla（伊迪拉）和岛上其他女性因为明显的原因而憎恶并害怕他。",
	"A skilled warrior and thoughtful philosopher from a respected family in Mytros, Keelan has a fiery temper. He feels that he deserves his fate on the island as he killed his brother in a fit of anger while arguing over a woman. Keelan is well respected by the other exiles, but this is not reciprocal. He detests everyone on the island, but he is careful not to let it show. He will urge the heroes not to free anyone from the island, because they all deserve to be here—or much worse.": "Keelan (凯兰)是一位来自迈特洛斯（Mytros）尊敬家族的技艺高超的战士和深思熟虑的哲学家。他火爆的脾气让他觉得自己命中注定要被流放到这个岛上，因为在与兄弟为一名女子争执时，他一时冲动杀死了自己的兄弟。尽管其他流放者对Keelan颇为尊敬，但这种尊重并不是相互的。他厌恶岛上的每个人，但却小心不让这种情绪表现出来。他会敦促英雄们不要释放岛上的任何人，因为他们都应该留在这里，甚至更糟。",
	"A self-righteous and angry man, Tyrone is perpetually plotting to escape the island. Tyrone was a loud-mouthed demagogue in Mytros, and his rabble-rousing ways eventually got him exiled. Six of the younger exiles are besotted by his words, but he has yet to be elected king, because everyone else knows that he's a small-minded blowhard. Tyrone will constantly badger the heroes to let him and his followers accompany them on their voyage. If he is rebuffed, he becomes angry, but he is too much of a coward to do anything about it.": "泰隆(Tyrone)是一个自以为是、愤怒的人，他一直在策划逃离这座岛屿。在迈特洛斯(Mytros)，泰隆是一个多嘴的煽动者，最终因煽动群众而被流放。六名年轻的流亡者被他的言论所迷惑，但他还没有被选为国王，因为其他人都知道他是一个心胸狭窄的吹牛大王。泰隆会不断纠缠英雄，要求让他和他的追随者一起同行。如果被拒绝，他会变得愤怒，但他太懦弱了，不敢采取任何行动。",
	"Idylla is one of the few women on the island. She boasts considerable influence and excellent political instincts. Idylla was exiled from Mytros because she is Acastus's mother, and many citizens felt that she was abusing her influence over the king in the early years of his reign. The nobility banded together to have her exiled. Acastus was outwardly distraught, but secretly, he was glad to be rid of his overbearing mother. Idylla is regarded as the most beautiful woman on the island. Many of the men vie for her favor, but she has been careful not to play favorites. If Idylla senses that she can convince a hero to take her off of the island, she will use her considerable charm to seduce them. She dotes on Acastus, but she has no loyalty to him, and she has no qualms betraying him if it means escaping the island.": "艾迪拉(Idylla)是岛上为数不多的女性之一。她拥有相当大的影响力和出色的政治直觉。艾迪拉因为是阿卡斯塔斯(Acastus)的母亲而被流放出迈特洛斯(Mytros)，许多市民认为她在国王执政初期滥用自己的影响力，贵族们联合起来将她流放。阿卡斯塔斯表面上很伤心，但实际上他很高兴摆脱了这个专横的母亲。艾迪拉被认为是岛上最美丽的女人。许多男人争相取悦她，但她小心翼翼地不偏袒任何人。如果艾迪拉觉得自己可以说服一位英雄带她离开岛屿，她会利用自己的魅力来诱使他们。她宠爱阿卡斯塔斯，但对他没有忠诚，如果逃离岛屿意味着背叛他，她毫不犹豫地会背叛他。",
	"King Stavros attempts to greet the heroes as soon as they arrive on the island. He approaches them with six other exiles, including Idylla and Keelan. He introduces himself and explains the nature of the island. He is quite open about their status as exiles and \"criminals\" in Mytros. He questions the heroes as to their purpose, but he will quickly steer the conversation to the problem he needs solved—a problem that is causing much distress to the island's makeshift community.": "斯塔夫洛斯国王在英雄们抵达岛屿时试图迎接他们。他和其他六名流亡者，包括伊迪拉(Idylla)和基兰(Keelan)，一起走向他们。他介绍自己并解释了岛屿的性质。他对他们作为流亡者和“罪犯”在迈特洛斯(Mytros)的身份非常坦诚。他询问英雄们的目的，但很快会把对话引向他需要解决的问题——这个问题给岛上的临时社区带来了很多困扰。",
	"Someone is murdering the other exiles. Four men have already been killed, all with their throats neatly cut. Idylla thinks it must be the recluse Tadd, while Stavros suspects that Tyrone is trying to supplant him. Keelan feels that jumping to conclusions doesn't help anything, as the murderer could be anyone, including one of the three of them. Stavros and Idylla want the heroes to investigate the murders—since they've just arrived, everyone agrees that they are neutral in the dispute.": "有人正在谋杀其他流放者。已经有四名男子被杀害，都是被割断喉咙。伊迪拉认为凶手可能是隐士塔德，而斯塔夫洛斯怀疑泰隆试图取代他的位置。基兰认为草率下结论并没有帮助，因为凶手可能是任何人，包括他们三人之一。斯塔夫洛斯和伊迪拉希望英雄们调查这些谋杀案件——因为他们刚刚到达，大家都同意他们在这场争端中是中立的。",
	"If the heroes agree, then they will find that everyone is tight-lipped about the murders, and all four bodies have been burned, leaving no remains. Unless some means of talking to the spirits of the murdered people can be found, solid evidence is difficult to find. However, if the party can come up with a convincing case against someone on the island, Stavros and Idylla will be satisfied. Keelan will not be happy with any explanation.": "如果英雄们同意，他们会发现每个人都对这些谋杀案守口如瓶，四具尸体都被焚烧，没有任何遗骸。除非找到一些与被害者灵魂交谈的方法，否则很难找到确凿的证据。然而，如果队伍能提出针对岛上某人的有力案件，斯塔夫洛斯和伊迪拉会感到满意。基兰对任何解释都不会满意。",
	"There are three possible explanations for the murders. You can choose any of the following to be true:": "这些谋杀案有三种可能的解释。您可以选择以下任何一种为真：",
	"Idylla believes that the most likely murderer is Tadd. He's a strange man, and he can offer no coherent account of his whereabouts over any period of time. He could easily kill someone and then instantly forget that he did it. He's also a monster.": "伊迪拉相信最有可能的凶手是泰德(Tadd)。他是个奇怪的人，无法清晰地说明自己在任何时间段的行踪。他很容易杀人然后立刻忘记自己做过。他也是个怪物。",
	"Tyrone is not the killer, but two of his men could be responsible. He has no idea whether they actually did it, but it would flatter him if they did. They've assaulted people who have spoken out against him in the past. Murder would be the natural next step, and his detractors deserve it, in any case.": "泰隆不是凶手，但他手下的两个人可能有责任。他不知道他们是否真的做了，但如果他们这样做了，这会让他感到荣幸。他们曾经袭击过那些公开反对他的人。谋杀将是自然的下一步，而且无论如何，他的反对者都应该得到应有的报应。",
	"Keelan has the necessary skills to kill people and cover it up. He loathes everyone on the island, but no one suspects him of murder, because everyone just assumes that he's as genial as his placid exterior suggests. If accused of the murder, Keelan might simply confess—he's just glad to finally talk about how much he hates everyone.": "基兰（Keelan）具备杀人并掩盖罪行的必要技能。他憎恨岛上的每个人，但没有人怀疑他犯过谋杀，因为每个人都只是假设他和他平静外表所展示的一样和蔼可亲。如果被指控谋杀，基兰可能会干脆承认—他只是很高兴终于能谈谈自己有多讨厌每个人。",
	"If the heroes solve the murder, then the exiles reward the party with a white ox worth 500 gp. The ox can be used as sacrificial livestock aboard the {@italic Ultros}.": "如果英雄们解决了这起谋杀案，那么流亡者会用价值500 gp的白色牛奖励该队伍。这头牛可以作为{@italic Ultros}上的祭祀牲畜。",
	"If the party solves the murder, they earn the respect of the exiles. The party may choose to take up to 25 of them on as crew for the {@italic Ultros}, to replenish any crew who have been lost at sea.": "如果队伍解决了这起谋杀案，他们将赢得流亡者的尊重。队伍可以选择最多将其中25人作为船员加入到{@italic Ultros}，以补充在海上失去的船员。",
	"If the party doesn't solve the murder, then the exiles are unwilling to join their crew. The thought of being confined on a ship with a potential murderer is more terrifying than remaining on the island.": "如果队伍不能解决这起谋杀案，那么这些流亡者将不愿意加入他们的船员。与潜在的凶手一起被困在船上的想法比留在岛上更可怕。",
	"You sail towards an island edged by sandy beaches and calm waters. The land is largely flat, and grasslands stretch out across the island, interrupted only by shrubs and small trees. The solitary structure visible from your ship is an ominous black stone tower at the island's center.": "你驶向一个被沙滩和平静水域环绕的岛屿。这片土地大部分是平坦的，草地一直延伸到整个岛屿，只有灌木和小树偶尔打断。从你的船上能看到的唯一建筑是岛屿中心的一座令人不安的黑色石塔。",
	"It's easy to find a place to anchor or beach a ship here. The island is relatively flat and storms keep the foliage sparse and low to the ground.": "在这里很容易找到一个停靠或停泊船只的地方。这个岛相对平坦，风暴使得植被稀疏且生长较低。",
	"This island is famed for the \"Scorpion Tribe,\" a lineage of cursed {@creature centaur|MM|centaurs} who have lived here for centuries.

	"Scorpions of every size and color live on the island, including the giant scorpions that used to be centaurs. The curse is the work of the {@bold Lotus Witch}, a powerful {@creature gynosphinx|MM} that lives in the tower at the center of the island. The sphinx keeps to herself. Those foolish enough to approach her tower never return.": "岛上生活着各种大小和颜色的蝎子，包括曾经是半人马的巨型蝎子。这个诅咒是{@bold Lotus Witch}的作品，一个生活在岛中心塔楼的强大{@creature gynosphinx|MM}。独行的狮身人面像保持着距离。那些愚蠢到靠近她塔楼的人永远不会回来。",
	"The centaurs here are all young and impetuous. There are no elders to temper their youth with wisdom, because the adults all leave the island or transform into scorpions. The knowledge that so many are doomed by the curse makes the centaurs wild, as they know that life can be very short. They band together into groups of twelve—racing, drinking, hunting, and frolicking. They avoid the giant scorpions.": "这里的半人马都年轻而冲动。没有长者来以智慧调和他们的年轻，因为成年人都离开了这个岛屿或者变成了蝎子。许多人注定要受到诅咒的知识使半人马变得狂野，因为他们知道生命可能会很短暂。他们组成了以十二人为一组的团体——赛跑、饮酒、狩猎和嬉戏。他们避开巨大的蝎子。",

	"The Scorpion Tribe centaurs are the only NPC centaurs in Thylea who allow themselves to be used as mounts. Centaur mounts act independently in combat, making them an exceptional addition to any party.": "天蝎部落半人马是泰莱亚唯一允许自己被用作坐骑的NPC半人马。半人马坐骑在战斗中独立行动，使它们成为任何队伍的卓越补充。",
	"Centaur heroes may still bond one of the centaurs from the Scorpion Tribe. In this case, they obviously cannot use them as a mount—instead, the bond must be true love.": "半人马英雄仍然可以与蝎子部落的半人马之一建立联系。在这种情况下，他们显然不能将其用作坐骑，而是必须建立真爱的联系。",
	"This island is also a holy place of initiation for the warriors of Aresia. Aresians who wish to be considered true warriors make a pilgrimage to the island and test themselves against the scorpions. This doubles as a funeral rite for the centaurs that were transformed.

Read the following:": "如果英雄们能够击败这支乐队，他们将被邀请参加一个盛大的宴会以示敬意。在宴会上，半人马们演奏音乐，仙女们在月光下起舞，而侏儒和半身人则大量饮酒。这种饮料是一种甜美的朗姆酒，由岛屿深处发现的甘蔗制成。请阅读以下内容：",
	"The full moon hangs in the clear night sky, providing a picturesque backdrop for the feast. Satyrs serenade you with their pipes while nymphs, halflings, and gnomes dance around the flickering fire. You never quite finish your sweet, potent drink, as your hosts are quick to fill your cup back up to its brim. The air is thick with the smell of alcohol, smoked fish, and fresh sweat.": "满月挂在晴朗的夜空中，为盛宴提供了如画般的背景。半人马吹着笛子为你奏乐，而仙女、半身人和侏儒们在摇曳的火光中跳舞。你从未完全喝完你那甜蜜而浓烈的饮料，因为你的主人总是迅速为你的杯子重新倒满。空气中弥漫着酒精、熏鱼和新鲜汗水的味道。",
	"Part way through the feast, Ventis the copper dragon attacks. She uses her acid breath and then starts killing indiscriminately. Read the following:": "在宴会进行到一半时，铜龙文提斯（Ventis）发动了袭击。她使用了她的酸息，并开始肆意杀戮。请阅读以下内容：",
	"The festivities are cut short by a most unwelcome guest. The triangular silhouette of a copper dragon glides in front of the full moon and swoops down to attack the party. Firelight reflects from her glimmering metallic scales. She spews a stream of acid that singes the edge of Chief Loopywoopy's headdress.": "一位极不受欢迎的客人打断了节日的欢乐。一只铜色龙的三角形轮廓在满月前滑过，然后俯冲下来袭击聚会。火光从她闪闪发光的金属鳞片上反射出来。她喷出一股酸液，烧焦了鲁皮乌皮酋长的头饰边缘。",
	"As soon as Ventis takes more than 20 damage, she uses her {@italic slowing breath} and retreats back to her lair. Chief Loopwoopy will try to convince the heroes to go after her. Loopwoopy explains that the dragon has been collecting a hoard of treasure from the surrounding islands.": "一旦文蒂斯受到超过20点伤害，她会使用她的{@italic slowing breath}，然后撤退回她的巢穴。酋长卢普乌皮会试图说服英雄们去追赶她。卢普乌皮解释说，这条龙一直在收集来自周围岛屿的宝藏。",
	"This strange island consists of three perfectly molded green hills surrounded by an impossible glass dome that rises out of the Cerulean Gulf. The glass dome encompasses the entire island. The wall is impervious to damage, but it can easily be bypassed by teleportation magic such as {@spell teleport} or {@spell dimension door}. Anchoring at the glass wall is trivial.": "这座奇怪的岛屿由三座完美塑造的绿色小山组成，四周被一座不可思议的玻璃圆顶环绕，从蔚蓝海湾中升起。玻璃圆顶覆盖整个岛屿。这道墙壁无法被破坏，但可以通过诸如{@spell teleport}或{@spell dimension door}的传送魔法轻松绕过。在玻璃墙处停泊是微不足道的。",
	"Most natives of Thylea know of the legend of the island and will share it with the heroes. Any crewmen on the {@italic Ultros} will almost certainly know that this is Titan's Folly. They are quite sure that this a place that must be avoided at all costs.": "Thylea的大多数本地人都知道这个岛屿的传说，并会与英雄们分享。{@italic Ultros}上的任何船员几乎肯定会知道这是泰坦的愚行。他们非常确定这是一个必须尽量避免的地方。",
	"While the island is rumored to be home to Thylea's greatest treasures, it was sealed away by Kentimane the Hundred Handed. His reasons for doing this are a complete mystery, even to the other gods. Legend suggests that the original war among the Titans was a direct result of whatever happened here. Thylean natives among the crew will warn the heroes to turn away and forget they ever saw this place.": "尽管传言该岛是蒂莉亚（Thylea）最宝贵的宝藏之地，但它被百手肯提曼（Kentimane the Hundred Handed）封印起来。他这样做的原因完全是个谜，甚至连其他神祇也不清楚。传说原始的泰坦之间的战争正是发生在这里的事件直接结果。船员中的蒂莉亚土著会警告英雄们转身离开，忘记他们曾经看到这个地方。",
	"Anyone who sees the wall will have strange dreams the following night. They might dream of fantastic magic items or something that they desire above all else. For example, paladins may dream of a holy avenger, wizards may dream of a staff of the magi, and rogues may dream of a cloak of invisibility. In the dream, ants carry the desired item from a miniature version of the island and drop it at the feet of the hero.": "任何看到这堵墙的人第二天晚上都会做奇怪的梦。他们可能会梦到奇幻的魔法物品或者他们最渴望的东西。例如，圣武士可能会梦到神圣复仇者，巫师可能会梦到魔法法杖，盗贼可能会梦到隐形斗篷。在梦中，蚂蚁会从岛屿的微缩版本中搬运所渴望的物品，并将其放在英雄的脚下。",
	"Titan's Folly! Now there's a mystery, eh? I bet it's full of glittering gold and beautiful nymphs and glorious battles! But my sister Vallus says that we are never to go there. Ah well.": "泰坦的愚蠢！现在有一个谜团，是吗？我打赌那里充满了闪闪发光的黄金、美丽的仙女和壮丽的战斗！但我的姐姐瓦鲁斯说我们永远不要去那里。啊，算了。",
	"If the heroes bypass the wall, read the following:": "如果英雄们绕过了墙，阅读以下内容：",
	"Once you have bypassed the curious glass dome, you continue toward the island. The most striking aspect of the place is its perfect geometric uniformity. The land consists of three identical green hills clumped together. Thick tropical grass grows in rows around each hill, interrupted only by rows of oak trees halfway to each hill's summit. Such a perfect land formation can only be the handiwork of the Mother Goddess, Thylea.": "一旦你绕过那个好奇的玻璃圆顶，你继续朝着那个岛屿前进。这个地方最引人注目的特点是它完美的几何规整性。这片土地由三座相同的绿色小山组成。茂密的热带草在每座小山周围的行列中生长，只有在每座小山的半山腰处才被一排橡树打断。这样完美的地形只能是母女神泰莉亚的杰作。",
	"The three hills are entirely covered in perfectly arranged fields of sugarcane. Each hill has a ring of ancient oak trees that circles the hill at the midpoint of the slope. Under the oak trees are entrances to a network of caves and tunnels.": "这三座山完全被完美布置的甘蔗田覆盖着。每座山的中点处有一圈古老的橡树环绕着山腰。在橡树下是通往一个洞穴和隧道网络的入口。",
	"The Titan Kentimane sealed this island away five millennia ago. It hasn't had a single visitor from the outside world in all that time. Inside the barrier, on this strange island, lives a race of creatures that don't exist anywhere else in the multiverse: the {@bold myrmekes}.": "五千年前，泰坦肯提曼封印了这座岛屿。在这段时间里，外界从未有过一位访客。在这个奇特的岛屿内部，生活着一种在多元宇宙中其他地方都不存在的生物：{@bold myrmekes}。",
	"The myrmekes are a race of hyper-intelligent insectlike humanoids that were created by one of Thylea's children at the dawn of time. There are around 3,000 myrmekes on the island, and they live in the caves beneath the oaks, where they store their food, raise their young and protect their queen.": "蚁人是一群超智能的类昆虫人形生物，是泰勒亚（Thylea）的一个子民在时代的黎明时创造的。岛上大约有3,000只蚁人，它们居住在橡树下的洞穴中，那里存放它们的食物，抚养幼崽并保护它们的女王。",
	"When they are met initially, the myrmekes can only communicate with clicks and by waving their antenna. They provoke no hostility. They bring out sumptuous offerings of food and drink. The food tastes like a form of delicious meat, while the drink is a sweet wine.": "当它们最初相遇时，蚁人只能通过点击和摇动它们的触角来交流。它们不会引起敌意。它们带来丰盛的食物和饮料。食物尝起来像一种美味的肉类，而饮料则是甜美的葡萄酒。",
	"Within a few hours on interacting with the heroes they will begin to communicate using the language that the heroes use. They are extremely social creatures who will warmly greet strangers to the island. They are also extremely curious. They ask the heroes many questions—about their deeds, hopes, desires, and goals: anything and everything will provoke the myrmekes into asking a question.": "在与英雄们互动几个小时后，他们会开始使用英雄们使用的语言进行交流。他们是非常社交的生物，会热情地欢迎来到岛上的陌生人。他们也非常好奇。他们会向英雄们提出许多问题——关于他们的事迹、希望、欲望和目标：任何事情都会引发蚁兵兽提出一个问题。",
	"The myrmekes are very accommodating, and can be light-hearted and funny. They won't stop the heroes from leaving early, and they will not restrict the party's movements on the island. If the heroes attack the myrmekes, they will defend themselves but will not retaliate. They will wait until the heroes exhaust themselves and then ask them, somewhat regretfully, to leave.": "蚁人族非常包容，可以轻松幽默。他们不会阻止英雄们提早离开，也不会限制队伍在岛上的活动。如果英雄们攻击蚁人族，他们会自卫，但不会进行报复。他们会等待英雄们耗尽力气，然后有些遗憾地要求他们离开。",
	"If the myrmekes are asked about the dome, they will claim that it was erected to trap them, as a punishment for insulting a powerful god, thousands of years ago. They will dispute the notion that Thylea imprisoned them, as she was their creator. If they are asked about powerful magical items, they will claim to have no ideas about such things. The truth is that the myrmekes' powerful hive mind is able to influence the unconscious minds of nearby humanoids.": "如果问及蚁人关于圆顶的问题，他们会声称这是为了囚禁他们而建造的，作为数千年前侮辱强大神灵的惩罚。他们会反驳锡莱亚（Thylea）囚禁他们的说法，因为她是他们的创造者。如果问及强大的魔法物品，他们会声称对此一无所知。事实上，蚁人强大的集体意识能够影响附近人类的潜意识。",
	"The myrmekes study everything that the heroes do and everything that they bring with them. Magic spells are especially interesting to them, as they have very little experience with magic.": "蚁人研究英雄们所做的一切以及他们带来的一切。对他们来说，魔法咒语尤其有趣，因为他们对魔法几乎没有经验。",
	"Once the heroes have left the island, the myrmekes will begin to plan their escape from the island. They will copy whatever method the heroes used to bypass the wall. For example, if the heroes used the {@spell dimension door} spell, then the myrmekes now know how to use it.": "一旦英雄们离开了岛屿，蚂蚁人将开始计划他们如何逃离这座岛屿。他们会模仿英雄们用来绕过城墙的任何方法。例如，如果英雄们使用了{@spell dimension door}咒语，那么蚂蚁人现在也知道如何使用它。",
	"At this point the myrmekes will begin working toward what they feel is their destiny: making the multiverse a reflection of their perfect society and people.": "在这一点上，蚁人将开始朝着他们认为是他们命运的方向努力：让多元宇宙成为他们完美社会和人民的反映。",
	"They will then send boats to the mainland where they will capture Thyleans and learn everything they can from them. This happens very quickly while the heroes are busy with their own affairs. Within a few weeks, the heroes might have the following encounter:": "然后他们会派船只前往大陆，俘虏(`Thyleans`)并从他们那里尽可能多地获取情报。这一切发生得非常迅速，而英雄们忙于处理自己的事务。几周内，英雄们可能会遇到以下情节：",
	"A fine galley ship sails towards your party. As it approaches, you find that the vessel is crewed and captained by a group of humanoid insects, the curious myrmekes you encountered not long ago.": "一艘精致的帆船朝着你们的队伍驶来。当它靠近时，你们发现这艘船由一群人形昆虫组成的船员和船长驾驶，正是你们不久前遇到的那些好奇的蚁人族群。",
	"Despite the short amount of time that has passed, the myrmekes have changed considerably. They now wear bronze armor and wield bronze weapons. They are no longer the friendly and inquisitive creatures of Titan's Folly. As these myrmekes approach, they look positively defiant and warlike.": "尽管时间很短，蚁兵们已经发生了巨大变化。它们现在穿着青铜盔甲，手持青铜武器。它们不再是泰坦荒岛上友好好奇的生物。当这些蚁兵走近时，它们看起来充满挑衅和战意。",
	"The ship is crewed by 30 {@creature myrmekes warrior|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|myrmekes warriors}. The myrmekes will attack the party's ship using tactics that would impress even the most jaded Aresian warrior monk. Six myrmekes warriors bombard the heroes with {@spell ray of frost|PHB|rays of frost} as a disciplined phalanx of ten myrmekes warriors attempts to board the ship.": "这艘船由30名{@creature myrmekes warrior|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|myrmekes warriors}组成的船员驾驶。蚁兵将袭击该队的船只，使用的战术甚至会让最麻木不仁的阿瑞斯僧侣战士感到印象深刻。六名蚁兵战士向英雄们投掷{@spell ray of frost|PHB|rays of frost}，而一队由十名蚁兵战士组成的纪律严明的方阵试图登上船只。",
	"If the heroes are able to survive this encounter, they begin to hear rumors of armies of insect men conquering outlying towns and villages. Initially the stories describe armies of hundreds of myrmekes, but after one month, the rumors describe an unstoppable army of more than a thousand myrmekes with advanced magic and siege weapons.": "如果英雄们能够在这次遭遇中幸存下来，他们开始听到关于昆虫人军队征服外围城镇和村庄的传闻。最初的故事描述了数百只蚁人的军队，但一个月后，传闻描述了一个由超过一千只蚁人组成的不可阻挡的军队，拥有先进的魔法和攻城武器。",
	"The myrmekes grow more advanced with each passing month, and the size of their army doubles just as quickly. If they aren't stopped, they will conquer all of Thylea and convert it into one giant ant colony. Then they will seek out new lands to conquer. These events are beyond the scope of this book, but they might form the basis of a future campaign.": "随着时间的推移，蚂蚁人(%num%)变得越来越先进，他们的军队规模也以同样的速度翻倍增长。如果不加以阻止，他们将征服整个锡利亚，并将其转变为一个巨大的蚂蚁群落。然后他们将寻找新的土地来征服。这些事件超出了本书的范围，但它们可能成为未来冒险的基础。",
	"Crystal clear blue water and a handful of smaller islands surround the landmass you are approaching. Dense tropical foliage covers the islands, and you can hear the cacophonous sounds of abundant wildlife.": "你正在接近的陆地周围是晶莹剔透的蓝色水域和几个较小的岛屿。密集的热带植被覆盖着这些岛屿，你可以听到丰富野生动物发出的喧闹声音。",
	"An impressive black mountain rises from the jungle at the center of the main island, and the smell of smoke and brimstone hangs in the air.": "主岛中央的丛林中耸立着一座令人印象深刻的黑色山峰，空气中弥漫着烟雾和硫磺的气味。",
	"Fire Island is almost completely surrounded by a coral reef, although careful seamanship can find a channel through the shoal waters. Beyond the coral reef, the waters are calm and a ship can easily anchor.": "火岛几乎完全被珊瑚礁环绕，尽管谨慎的航海技术可以在浅滩水域中找到一条航道。超过珊瑚礁后，水域平静，船只可以轻松停泊。",
	"As its name suggests, Fire Island is formed around an active volcano, which occasionally belches ash and fiery embers into the air, making it dangerous to approach. Currently, the volcano is quiet, with just a thin trail of smoke snaking into the sky above the caldera.": "正如其名字所示，火焰岛环绕着一个活火山而形成，这个火山偶尔会喷出灰烬和火焰般的火星，使得靠近它变得很危险。目前，这座火山很安静，只有一条薄薄的烟尘从火山口升入天空。",
	"Fire Island is inhabited by several tribes of lizardfolk, who are engaged in endless, brutal wars against one other. The strongest tribe boasts 350 warriors. They are called the Firewalkers, because they control the land around the central volcano.": "火岛上居住着几个部落的蜥蜴人，他们之间进行着无休止的残酷战争。最强大的部落拥有350名战士。他们被称为火行者，因为他们控制着中央火山周围的土地。",
	"The Firewalkers are led by {@creature Jankor|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords} (NE {@creature lizard king|MM}), who is served by three {@creature lizardfolk shaman|MM|lizardfolk shamans} and a pair of {@creature cyclops|MM|cyclopes}.

	"Other than lizardfolk, the island has bountiful animal life, including boar, deer, and other smaller mammals. The streams and ponds of the island are often hunting grounds for {@creature crocodile|MM|crocodiles} or {@creature constrictor snake|MM|constrictor snakes}. {@creature Giant lizard|MM|Giant lizards} are also plentiful on the island and have been domesticated by all of the tribes as beasts of burden.": "除了蜥蜴人外，该岛屿拥有丰富的动物生活，包括野猪、鹿和其他较小的哺乳动物。该岛屿的溪流和池塘经常是{@creature crocodile|MM|crocodiles}或{@creature constrictor snake|MM|constrictor snakes}的狩猎场所。{@creature Giant lizard|MM|Giant lizards}在该岛上也很常见，并已被所有部落驯化为牲畜。",
	"Centuries ago, the island was also home to an adult brass dragon. However, it was killed by the Kraken during one of its hunts over the nearby coral reefs.

	"When the heroes first land, they will be approached by a {@creature lizardfolk shaman|MM} who is escorted by six {@creature lizardfolk|MM}. They will ask the heroes to accompany them to see their queen, who lives on the outskirts of the jungle. {@bold Vytha} (NE {@creature lizard queen|MM}) will implore the heroes to aid her in defeating her mortal enemy, Jankor, the king of the Firewalkers. She describes how Jankor has corrupted the lizardfolk by turning away from the god in the volcano and making sacrifices to Sydon instead.": "当英雄们第一次登陆时，他们会被一名{@creature lizardfolk shaman|MM}所接近，由六名{@creature lizardfolk|MM}护送。他们会邀请英雄们陪同他们去见他们的女王，女王住在丛林的边缘。{@bold Vytha}(NE {@creature lizard queen|MM})会恳求英雄们帮助她击败她的死敌，火行者之王詹科尔。她描述了詹科尔如何腐化了蜥蜴人，背弃了火山中的神灵，转而向赛登献祭。",
	"Vytha explains that the Firewalkers have been chosen by Sydon to dominate Fire Island. The Lord of Storms gave Jankor a powerful magical artifact and two cyclopes as servants.

Vytha believes that the other two eggs may be located somewhere on in the volcano village.": "Vytha解释说，Sydon选择了火行者们来统治火岛。风暴之主给了Jankor一个强大的魔法神器和两个独眼巨人作为仆人。作为交换，Jankor给了泰坦岛上隐藏的三个{@item brass dragon egg|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|brass dragon eggs}之一。Vytha相信另外两个蛋可能位于火山村庄的某处。",
	"Tribes of lizardfolk wouldn't normally warrant the attention of the Lord of Storms. Sydon has intervened here because his sister Chalcia is sealed away beneath the volcano, and he wishes to keep it that way. She is the 'sleeping god' worshipped by the lizardfolk. The Firewalkers' daily sacrifices to the volcano ensure that this magical seal remains intact.": "蜥蜴人部落通常不会引起风暴领主的注意。Sydon在这里介入是因为他的妹妹Chalcia被封印在火山下面，他希望保持这种状态。她是蜥蜴人崇拜的“沉睡之神”。火行者每天向火山献祭，确保这个魔法封印保持完整。",
	"If the heroes agree to assist her, Queen Vytha will hold a great feast in their honor. She proudly explains that her son is to be sacrificed and served as the celebratory meal.

The drop will break through the crust into the magma, causing 55 ({@damage 10d10}) fire damage to the unfortunate creature that fell.": "当踩到时，地面会崩塌，如果豁免扑克牌失败，就会使人坠入下方的火山口。掉落会穿透地壳进入岩浆，对不幸坠落的生物造成55 ({@damage 10d10}) 火焰伤害。",
	"These chambers are relatively bare, except for the large stone bowls scattered around the room that have been gently packed with eggs and straw.

	"Although a modest forge has been built into one side of this cave, it is noticeably cooler in here than in the rest of the fort. The cave's sole resident, a 9-foot-tall cyclops, sits at a stone table at the center of the room. He wears a monocle over his eye, and he has remarkably nimble, ten-fingered hands. He is tinkering with what appears to be a half-finished mechanical goat. Other clockwork animals fill niches that have been carved into the cavern wall opposite the forge.": "尽管这个洞穴的一侧建有一个简陋的锻造炉，但在这里比堡垒的其他地方明显要凉快。洞穴里唯一的居民，一个身高9英尺的独眼巨人，坐在房间中央的石桌旁。他戴着单片眼镜，手指灵活，有十根手指。他正在修补一个看起来像是半成品的机械山羊。其他发条动物填满了对面洞穴墙上被雕刻出来的壁龛。",

	"Since his arrival, Steros has built himself a small forge that he keeps heated with the help of a pair of fire snakes. Using this forge, he builds weapons for the Firewalkers, a task that he considers to be beneath his considerable skills.

	"An obsidian entranceway leads into an artificial cave dug into the side of the cliff. The furnishings within this chamber are considerably more opulent than anywhere else in the fort, with vivid silks, gilded furniture, and voluminous pillows.

This seems like a fair deal to him.": "当波利福鲁斯(Polyphorus)被警告有入侵者时，他会嗅一下空气，并要求对方自我标识。一旦他满足了好奇心，他会向英雄中的一位挑战一场臂力比拼。他解释说，如果他输了，他会告诉英雄们詹科尔(Jankor)把一把强大的魔法武器藏在哪里。如果他赢了，那么他会吃掉其中一位。这对他来说似乎是一个公平的交易。",
	"Because of the size difference, Polyphorus will allow his opponent to use both arms in the competition. The competition consists of three opposed Strength checks.

He is not loyal to Gaius, but he provides assistance to the Order when called for. Both Gaius and Chondrus were present when the heroes were called before King Acastus, and they remember the heroes well.": "{@adventure Chondrus|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|19|Chondrus}，大图书馆的大师，也在这里。他并不忠于盖乌斯，但在被召唤时会为秩序提供帮助。当英雄们被召见到阿卡斯托斯国王面前时，盖乌斯和肯德鲁斯都在场，并且他们对这些英雄记忆犹新。",
	"This island was the ancient capital of the Gygan Empire that once dominated much of Thylea. The gygans were already in decline when the Dragonlords arrived, but most of those that remained were wiped out in the First War. The gygan communities and forts on Yonder were razed by the Dragonlords in the last days of the struggle.": "这座岛曾是古代吉甘帝国的首都，该帝国曾统治着大部分的泰利亚。当龙领主们到来时，吉甘人已经开始衰落，但大部分留下的人在第一次战争中被消灭了。在斗争的最后日子里，龙领主们摧毁了Yonder上的吉甘社区和堡垒。",
	"In the last decade, the Order of Sydon has made the island their main base of operations. The few gygans who still lived on the island were eager to work with the Order and thereby gain favor with Sydon. They believe that this, perhaps, is a chance to return to the glory of ages past.": "在过去的十年里，Sydon教团（Order of Sydon）已经将这个岛屿作为他们的主要行动基地。岛上仍然居住的少数吉甘人（gygans）急切地愿意与教团合作，以此赢得Sydon的青睐。他们相信，也许这是重返辉煌的机会。",
	"Two buildings have been mostly reconstructed by the Order and the gygans. One is a small tower close to the cove that allows landfall. The other is a magnificent library near the center of the island. The rest of the island is covered in ruins from the ancient gygan civilization. There are a half-dozen sites that show broken marble pillars and slabs of concrete, some of which are partially charred by dragon fire.": "两座建筑物已经被(`the Order`)和(`the gygans`)大部分重建。一座是靠近海湾的小塔楼，可供登陆。另一座是岛屿中心附近的壮丽图书馆。岛的其余部分覆盖着古代(`gygan`)文明的废墟。有半打地点展示着破碎的大理石柱和混凝土板，其中一些部分被龙火烧焦。",
	"The skeletal remains of gygans are everywhere in these ruins. The few living gygans avoided the ruins out of superstitious fear of the long dead. There are animals on the island, but they are mostly seagulls and small animals such as rats and shrews.": "这些废墟中到处都是巨人的骨骼遗骸。少数活着的巨人因为对长逝的恐惧而避开了这些废墟。岛上有动物，但它们大多是海鸥和小动物，比如老鼠和鼩鼱。",
	"The many ruins across the island have been mostly picked clean by the Order of Sydon. All that remains are the bones of the gygans who died five centuries ago. The gygans who still live on Yonder leave these bones in the open as a reminder of the evils that the Dragonlords visited upon their people.": "岛上的许多废墟大多已被赛登教团（Order of Sydon）搜刮一空。剩下的只有五个世纪前死去的巨人的骨骼。仍然生活在Yonder的巨人将这些骨骼留在户外，作为龙领主（Dragonlords）对他们人民施加的邪恶的提醒。",

	"Once Marcion becomes aware of the heroes, he will send one of his men to inform Gaius at the library. Marcion will try to ensure that the garrison remains in the tower unless ordered otherwise by Gaius or Chondrus. However, if the Ultros makes anchor within visible range of the tower, Marcion will be unable to stop the two gygans in his garrison from going down to try and kill anyone coming to shore.": "一旦马尔西翁意识到英雄们的存在，他会派遣手下之一通知图书馆的盖乌斯。马尔西翁会尽力确保守备队留在塔内，除非盖乌斯或康德鲁斯下令让他们离开。然而，如果乌尔特洛斯号停泊在塔可见范围内，马尔西翁将无法阻止他麾下的两名巨人下去试图杀死任何靠岸的人。",

	"Most of the Order think that the library is somehow giving them information through such spells as {@spell contact other plane} and {@spell legend lore}, but this is not all that has been happening. Chondrus, the master of the library, has been making deals with the yugoloths of Hades. The library also has a half-dozen scholars (LE {@creature noble|MM|nobles}) to tend to the books and scrolls, along with four {@creature acolyte|MM|acolytes} who study arcane lore, conduct magical experiments, and use divination magic to look beyond Thylea.": "大多数{@spell contact other plane}认为图书馆通过{@spell legend lore}等咒语向他们提供信息，但这并不是所有发生的事情。图书馆的主人Chondrus一直在与Hades的yugoloths做交易。图书馆还有半打学者（LE (Lawful Evil)）负责照料书籍和卷轴，还有四名{@creature acolyte|MM|acolytes}研究奥术知识，进行魔法实验，并使用占卜魔法窥探Thylea之外的世界。",
	"Finally, the library is also home to soldiers and gygans under command of Gaius, the supreme commander of the Order of Sydon.": "最后，图书馆也是由加乌斯(Gaius)指挥的西顿骑士团(Order of Sydon)的士兵和巨人(gygans)的家园。",
	"The cliffs surrounding the library are 200 ft. in height. The cliffs are steep and require a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to scale.

	"The doors of the library are all built for Large-sized humanoids. Medium and smaller creatures need to use an action to open the doors here.": "图书馆的门都是为大型生物建造的。中等和更小的生物需要使用一个动作才能打开这里的门。",
	"While Gaius may have learned that strangers have made landfall on Yonder, he is confident that sending out one of his captains should deal with the threat. The garrison at the library will not become alert until intruders are seen approaching the gates—or until a fight breaks out inside the walls. If the library is alerted to intruders, all of the soldiers in both barracks will be roused. The walls and towers at the front gate will be reinforced, and a warband will be dispatched to intercept the heroes. The warband includes six {@creature soldier|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|soldiers}, one {@creature gygan|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}, and a {@creature soldier, captain|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|captain} with orders to kill the heroes.": "尽管盖乌斯可能已经得知陌生人已经登陆了Yonder，但他相信派遣其中一位船长应该足以应对威胁。图书馆的守军直到看到入侵者靠近城门或者城墙内发生战斗才会警觉。如果图书馆发现有入侵者，两个兵营的士兵都会被唤醒。前门的城墙和塔楼会被加固，一支战队将被派遣拦截英雄。这支战队包括六名{@creature soldier|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|soldiers}，一名{@creature gygan|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}，和一名{@creature soldier, captain|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|captain}，他们的任务是消灭这些英雄。",

	"Argyn is usually hunting dolphins and whales in the waters close to the island, and it will take her about ten minutes to return. If the heroes leave the library before Argyn arrives, then Gaius will mount up and search for their ship from the air. Once he finds the ship, he will attempt to kill everyone onboard. If the heroes have not yet encountered Sydon's fleet, then he may summon them to his aid.": "阿尔金通常在靠近岛屿的水域里捕猎海豚和鲸鱼，她大约需要十分钟才能返回。如果英雄们在阿尔金到达之前离开图书馆，盖乌斯将骑马上空搜索他们的船只。一旦他找到船只，他将试图杀死船上的所有人。如果英雄们还没有遇到赛顿的舰队，他可能会召唤他们前来帮助。",
	"This road leads to a ruined city, which stands at the top of a plateau. At the center of the ruined city is a massive structure which appears to have been built by giants.

They are engraved with images depicting six-armed cyclopes.": "这条道路通往一个废墟城市，它矗立在一个高原之巅。在废墟城市的中心是一座巨大的建筑，看起来像是由巨人建造的。石砌结构上的颜色变化表明这是一座古老的建筑，最近才被修复。入口处的巨大青铜门紧闭着，上面雕刻着描绘六臂独眼巨人的图像。",

	"This is the entrance to the library, and the building is in excellent condition. The statuary is mostly in ruins, because none of the gygans on the island are artisans capable of repairing such stonework. The two massive bronze doors are always kept closed, but they are not locked.

When you sail close enough to properly see through this haze, you find that rocky cliffs have formed a natural plateau, elevating the island's landscape far above the water.

	"Helios came here as a wyrmling 600 years ago, blown off course while flying between continents. He makes infrequent visits to mainland Thylea, mostly to check on various ancient shrines that were constructed to honor him, centuries ago.

	"Helios is suspicious of anyone who comes to his island. Sydon warned him long ago that Thyleans would send heroes to kill and flay him for his beautiful golden skin. There is, indeed, an almost forgotten legend that the skin of \"the Sun God\" grants immortality to any who wear it, and one of the {@italic Ultros'} crew will mention it if Helios is discussed when the heroes are aboard.": "赫利俄斯对来到他岛上的任何人都持怀疑态度。西顿很久以前警告过他，泰勒人会派遣英雄前来杀死他，剥下他那美丽的金色皮肤。的确，有一个几乎被遗忘的传说，说“太阳神”的皮肤能赐予任何穿戴者永生，如果英雄们在船上时讨论到赫利俄斯，{@italic Ultros'}船员中的一人会提到这一点。",
	"In spite of his understandably suspicious nature, Helios is always pleased by the prospect of visitors. The company of cyclopes leaves much to be desired as they are crude, often violent folk.

The heroes will be on the menu if he decides they represent a threat to his domain, or to Sydon.": "尽管他天性多疑，但赫利俄斯总是对有访客的可能性感到高兴。与独眼巨人为伍，实在令人不满，因为他们粗鲁、常常暴力。赫利俄斯也渴望了解泰莱亚的时事。他不会向访客展示自己的龙形，直到他决定是否吞食他们，或者他们直接攻击他。如果他认为英雄们对他的领地或西顿构成威胁，他们将成为他的菜单上的一道菜。",
	"Centuries ago, Helios swore an {@reward Oath of Service|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|oath of service} to Sydon in order to protect his island.

	"This island is called Typhon, but it has several other names: the \"Island of Horror,\" the \"Island of the Maw,\" and the \"Father of Monsters.\" At the center of the island is a scar in the fabric of reality, a gaping pit that connects the mortal world to the plane of Hades. Legend has it that many of the warped monstrosities that haunt the world came from here—hence its name.": "这座岛屿被称为泰芬岛(Typhon)，但它还有几个其他名字：\"恐怖之岛\"，\"巨口之岛\"和\"怪物之父\"。岛屿中心是现实之间的一道裂痕，一个巨大的深坑，连接着凡间世界和冥界。传说讲述许多扭曲的怪物来自这里——因此得名。",

It summons {@creature mezzoloth|MM|mezzoloths} to fish in the ocean and bring it back fresh food. It prefers dolphins, mermen, and occasionally, trespassing mortals.

	"Lutheria is unsportsmanlike during the game. She gloats when she wins a round and sulks when she loses. She becomes increasingly agitated when she's losing. She may go so far as to expend all three uses of legendary resistance in order to ensure her own victory.": "Lutheria在游戏中不够体育精神。她赢了一局时会沾沾自喜，输了时会闷闷不乐。当她正在输时会变得越来越烦躁。她甚至可能会为了确保自己的胜利而耗尽三次传奇豁免的使用次数。",

	"If the heroes ask Lutheria to renew her commitment to the Oath of Peace, then she will agree to do so under one condition: the entire party must swear an indefinite {@reward oath of service|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords} to her. The heroes would be required to do essentially anything she asks for the rest of their lives, as if under the effects of an unbreakable {@spell geas} spell.": "如果英雄们要求露瑟莉亚重新承诺遵守和平誓约，那么她会同意，但有一个条件：整个队伍必须对她发誓效忠{@reward oath of service|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}。英雄们将被要求在余生中无条件地完成她提出的任何要求，就像受到一种无法解除的{@spell geas}咒语的影响。",
	"Lutheria agrees not to harm any of the mortal cities of Thylea. Her temples would remain standing, and she would still require sacrifices, but things would continue much as they have been.": "卢瑟利亚同意不伤害泰莱亚的任何凡人城市。她的神庙将继续屹立，仍需祭品，但事情会继续如同过去一样。",
	"Lutheria has no interest in her husband's schemes. The heroes would still be free to assail Praxys and battle Sydon or negotiate with him separately. She will not interfere with these tasks.

	"This battle should be very difficult, and it should force the heroes to expend all of their resources.

	"If the Doomed One is present, Lutheria spends the first round in combat laughing uncontrollably at the lifetime of misfortune that she inflicted on them. If the Haunted One is present, Lutheria realizes that she's made a mistake and concentrates all her efforts on killing them.": "如果注定者在场，卢瑟莉亚在战斗的第一回合会不受控制地笑着，因为她给他们带来的一生不幸。如果受诅者在场，卢瑟莉亚意识到自己犯了一个错误，并集中所有精力来杀死他们。",

	"Lutheria collapses to her knees, grasping at the air in front of you. She unleashes a screeching wail of anguish, refusing to believe that a band of mere mortals has defeated her.

The light explodes into a storm of cosmic matter—and then she vanishes.": "路瑟利亚(Lutheria)跪倒在你面前，手伸向空气。她发出一声撕心裂肺的哀嚎，拒绝相信一群凡人竟然打败了她。她的身体慢慢变成一团奇异扭曲的光芒。光芒爆炸成一团宇宙物质的风暴，然后她消失了。",
	"When first we sailed into Thylea from the Old World, we did not know that we were trespassers. But then we saw the great Tower, its red light glaring at us from miles away. And we knew that we had stumbled into the realm of the gods.": "当我们第一次从旧世界航行进入蒂勒亚时，我们并不知道自己是闯入者。但当我们看到那座巨塔，它的红光从几英里之外瞪视着我们。我们意识到自己已经闯入了众神的领域。",
	"The tower of Praxys is the oldest and tallest structure in Thylea. It is one of the few remaining landmarks from the time when gods walked among mortals, and the dragons and giants fought for primacy. Praxys serves as the throne of Sydon, the Lord of Storms. He uses it as a guard tower to watch for incursions from the outer world. The Titan has modified and rebuilt the tower over many centuries, and thousands of cyclopes and gygan workers have died to fashion his \"palace.\"": "普拉克西斯之塔是泰勒亚最古老、最高的建筑。它是少数几个留存至今的地标之一，见证了诸神行走于凡人之间、龙和巨人争夺至高权力的时代。普拉克西斯之塔是西顿之座，风暴之主。他将其用作瞭望塔，以监视外界的入侵。这位泰坦在许多世纪里修改和重建了这座塔，成千上万的独眼巨人和巨灵工人为打造他的“宫殿”而献出了生命。",
	"Sydon is often found at Praxys, surrounded by his sons and daughters. Although Sydon and Lutheria have come to hate one another in recent centuries, the twins bore these young empyrean children together in anticipation of the end of the Oath of Peace. Sydon has trained them to reclaim the powers of the Five Gods.": "Sydon经常出现在Praxys，周围被他的儿子和女儿包围着。尽管Sydon和Lutheria在最近的几个世纪里彼此憎恨，但这对双胞胎共同生下了这些年轻的天界子女，期待和平誓约的结束。Sydon已经训练他们重新获得五位神祇的力量。",

	"After days of sailing into the far reaches of the ocean, the weather turns rough. Powerful storm waves threaten to overturn your ship, rocking it from side to side, and a thick blanket of fog obscures the sea around you. The wreckage of broken ships drifts past your prow, and you begin to wonder whether you will share the fates of their unfortunate crews.": "在航行了数日进入大海的边远地区后，天气变得恶劣。强大的风暴浪潮威胁着翻覆你的船只，使其来回摇晃，一层厚厚的雾气遮蔽了你周围的海域。残骸的碎船从你的船头漂过，你开始怀疑自己是否会和那些不幸船员们一样命运。",
	"Eventually, you notice a beam of light, which seems to sweep the surrounding seas from an immense height. Massive rocks emerge from the fog: the foundations of a gargantuan stone tower. Your ship suddenly feels very exposed—tiny and vulnerable next to the impossible size of the structure which now looms above you. This can only be the Tower of Sydon.": "最终，你注意到一道光束，似乎从极高处扫过周围的海域。巨大的岩石从雾中显现出来：一个巨大石塔的基础。你的船突然感到非常暴露——在这座巨大建筑物的不可思议尺寸旁边，显得微不足道和脆弱。这只能是(塞冬之塔)。",
	"{@italic Praxys} is a great tower of stone, which breaks upward through a headland of limestone. It is massive in size, beyond any human scale, towering more than 1,500 feet into the air. It was carved from a small mountain that rose out of the ocean. The tower is 200 feet across, and its interior is filled with vast empty spaces that serve as storage chambers and prisons. Only three floors are designed to be habitable by mortal creatures, and each of these floors have ceilings that are 30 ft. in height, in order to accommodate Titans and giants.": "{@italic Praxys} 是一座巨大的石塔，从一块石灰岩的岬角中拔地而起。它的规模庞大，超出了任何人类的尺度，高耸超过1,500英尺。它是从一座从海洋中升起的小山上雕刻而成的。这座塔宽200英尺，内部充满了巨大的空间，用作储藏室和监狱。只有三层被设计为适合凡人居住，每层的天花板高30英尺，以容纳泰坦和巨人。",
	"Across many miles of ocean, Sydon's tower projects a piercing ray of silver light, which searches for trespassers. This light radiates from the heart of a star that Sydon has imprisoned at the pinnacle of the tower.": "横跨许多英里的海洋，赛登(Sydon)的塔发射出一道刺眼的银色光束，搜寻着入侵者。这道光线辐射自赛登将一颗星星囚禁在塔顶的核心。",
	"A huge stone dock juts out to the south. It was built for ships manned by gygans or cyclopes, not for human vessels. The dock is protected by a dozen ballista crewed by {@creature gygan|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|gygans}. Each gygan can load, aim and fire its ballista in a single round due to their size and six arms.": "一座巨大的石头码头向南延伸。它是为由巨人或独眼巨人操纵的船只建造的，而不是为人类船只而建。这个码头由{@creature gygan|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|gygans}操作的十二门弩炮保护着。每个巨人由于其体型和六只手臂，可以在一个回合内装填、瞄准和发射他们的弩炮。",
	"Ballista Bolt. {@atk rw} {@hit 8} range 120/480 ft., one target. {@h}18 ({@damage 3d10 + 2}) piercing damage.": "弩矢。{@atk rw} 射程 120/480 尺，单一目标。{@h}18 ({@damage 3d10 + 2}) 穿刺伤害。",
	"This massive stone tower must be at least 1,500 feet tall. There is a large stone dock on the south side of the tower, which appears to be incredibly ancient, possibly thousands of years old. It stands strong against the abuses of the waves and weather, and a foreboding air surrounds the place. Birds wheel around the heights of the tower but, as the scale of the place hits home, you realize that they are not seagulls. The \"birds\" are distant griffons, each the size of a horse. The massive double doors at the base of the tower appear nigh-impenetrable.": "这座巨大的石塔至少有1,500英尺高。在塔的南侧有一个巨大的石头码头，看起来非常古老，可能有数千年历史。它顶住了海浪和恶劣天气的侵袭，周围笼罩着一种不祥的气氛。鸟儿在塔的高处盘旋，但当你意识到这个地方的规模时，你意识到它们并不是海鸥。这些“鸟”是遥远的狮鹫，每只都有一匹马那么大。塔基底部的巨大双门看起来几乎无法被穿透。",
	"The double adamantine doors are 40 ft. tall and cannot be damaged. They are barred from the other side. They can be forced open by characters with a combined Strength of 200 or more; no check is necessary if the group are strong enough, but no more than a dozen humans can attempt the task at once. If the heroes lack the combined strength, they will have to find another way in—through the flooded basement.": "这扇双层精金大门高40英尺，无法被破坏。它们从另一侧被闩上。只有拥有总力量值达到200或以上的角色才能强行打开它们；如果团队足够强壮，则无需进行检定，但最多只能有十二名人类尝试此任务。如果英雄们的总力量不足，他们将不得不另寻他法——通过被淹没的地下室。",
	"The griffons flying around the tower nest in many places on ledges and in window openings. They are aggressive towards anyone who tries to approach the tower by air. Someone using flight will be swarmed by 7 ({@dice 2d6}) {@creature griffon|MM|griffons}. In addition, the {@adventure Fallen Star|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|11|S37.

If the first group of griffons are defeated, the light summons another swarm after {@dice 2d6} rounds.": "飞狮在塔楼周围飞来飞去，在许多檐口和窗户开口处筑巢。它们对任何试图通过空中接近塔楼的人都很具攻击性。任何使用飞行的人都会被7只{@dice 2d6} {@creature griffon|MM|griffons}包围。此外，{@adventure Fallen Star|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|11|S37. The Fallen Star} (S37) 会照亮任何试图进入的飞行生物。如果第一组飞狮被打败，光线会在{@dice 2d6} 回合后召唤另一群。",
	"There are three obvious ways to gain entry to the tower.": "有三种明显的方法可以进入这座塔。",
	"A direct assault on the main dock and gate is probably the most difficult. The gygans fire their ballistae as soon as approaching ships come within range. Once the gygans are dealt with, the main doors must somehow be opened. A direct assault almost certainly puts the tower on alert status.": "直接袭击主码头和大门可能是最困难的。当船只接近射程时，巨人们会立即发射他们的弩炮。一旦处理掉巨人们，主门必须以某种方式被打开。几乎可以肯定，直接袭击会使塔楼处于警戒状态。",
	"Approaching from the air is difficult due to the griffons. But if the heroes are able to make it past the griffons, then they will have easy access to areas S9 and S26. All other windows in the tower are permanent {@spell wall of force|PHB|walls of force}.": "由于狮鹫的存在，从空中接近会很困难。但如果英雄们能够成功避开狮鹫，那么他们将很容易进入S9和S26区域。塔楼中的所有其他窗户都是永久性的{@spell wall of force|PHB|walls of force}。",
	"The easiest approach is underwater. Anyone sailing around the tower will notice pipes located just below the water level. These pipes are large enough for Medium-sized creatures to make their way into the tower. The pipes provide access to areas S5, S10, S19, and S22.": "最简单的方法是水下。任何绕过塔的航行者都会注意到位于水面下方的管道。这些管道足够大，可以让中等大小的生物进入塔内。这些管道通往S5、S10、S19和S22区域。",
	"There are many different methods to travel up and down within the tower. At its center is a spiral staircase that climbs from ground level all the way to the tower's summit. The staircase was built for giants, so a humansized creature will find the constant climbing rather exhausting. Some levels are connected by a cleverly constructed elevator that was built when Sydon still possessed the divine power of artifice.": "在塔内有许多不同的方法可以往返。在塔的中心是一座螺旋楼梯，从地面一直延伸到塔顶。这座楼梯是为巨人建造的，所以一个人类大小的生物会发现不停地爬行相当耗费体力。一些楼层通过一部巧妙构造的电梯相连，这部电梯是在Sydon还拥有神圣的工匠力量时建造的。",
	"Huge bronze pipes run from the underwater basement and feed water to all of the floors, and sometimes aquatic creatures use these pipes. They swim with the current in the pipes to move about the tower.": "巨大的青铜管道从水下地下室延伸，为所有楼层供水，有时水生生物会利用这些管道。它们顺着管道的水流游动，以在塔内移动。",
	"The griffons that roost on the window ledges of the tower could potentially be used as mounts by anyone intrepid enough to figure out how to tame them. Although the griffons are monstrosities, they can be targeted with {@spell animal friendship} and other spells that target beasts. Mounting a charmed griffon requires someone in the party to make a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.": "在塔楼窗台上栖息的狮鹫，有可能被任何足够勇敢且能够想出如何驯服它们的人当作坐骑。尽管狮鹫是畸变生物，它们可以被用 {@spell animal friendship} 和其他以野兽为目标的法术攻击。骑乘被驯服的狮鹫需要队伍中的某人成功进行一次DC 18的感知（动物处理）检定。",
	"The ceilings are 30 ft. high unless otherwise noted.": "天花板高度为30英尺，除非另有注明。",
	"The doors are bronze unless otherwise noted. There are three types of doors. The {@bold small doors} are 5 ft. wide and 10 ft. high. The {@bold large doors} are 10 ft. wide and 25 ft. high. The {@bold double doors} are each 5 ft. wide and 25 ft. high. Opening a large or double door is easy for large creatures. Medium and smaller creatures must use an action, and opening the doors requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.": "除非另有说明，门都是青铜制的。有三种类型的门。{@bold small doors} 宽5英尺，高10英尺。{@bold large doors} 宽10英尺，高25英尺。{@bold double doors} 每个宽5英尺，高25英尺。对于大型生物来说，打开大门或双开门很容易。中型及更小生物必须使用一个动作，打开门需要成功通过DC 10的力量（体育）检定。",
	"All of the rooms are lit by a single {@item driftglobe|DMG} that emanates light using the {@spell light} spell. Unlike the standard {@spell light} spell, this light lasts for 8 hours before ending.

If the driftglobes are taken from the tower, they cease to be magical.": "所有的房间都由一个单一的{@item driftglobe|DMG} 照亮，它使用{@spell light} 法术散发光芒。与标准{@spell light} 法术不同，这种光芒持续8小时才会消失。{@italic Praxys} 的所有居民都知道飘光球的口令。如果飘光球被从塔中取走，它们就会失去魔法效果。",
	"The sound of distant furnaces, hammering, and machinery can be heard throughout the tower. On the Forge level these sounds are loudest, but on the other levels it can still be heard as ambient background noise. The sound makes it difficult for tower inhabitants to hear the sounds of battle in rooms that are close by. The DC for all Perception checks to listen are also increased by 5.": "整座塔楼中传来着遥远的熔炉声、锤击声和机械声。在锻造层，这些声音最为响亮，但在其他楼层，它们仍然可以被听到作为背景噪音。这些声音让塔楼居民很难听到附近房间中战斗的声音。所有的感知检定听觉的 DC 也增加了 5 点。",
	"Each floor of the tower is protected by a permanent {@spell forbiddance} spell. The forbiddance for one floor can be cancelled by a {@spell dispel magic} at DC 19. The forbiddance makes teleporting into the tower or using magical gates or ethereal travel to gain entry impossible. Sydon, his children, and any yugoloth in the tower know the password to ignore the forbiddance.": "每层塔楼都受到一个永久的{@spell forbiddance}法术的保护。一个楼层的禁制可以通过一个DC 19的{@spell dispel magic}来取消。这个禁制使得通过传送术进入塔楼或使用魔法传送门或虚实旅行来进入变得不可能。Sydon，他的孩子们以及塔楼中的任何犹格洛斯都知道忽略禁制的密码。",

	"The Throne level of Praxys is the dwelling place of Sydon, Lord of Storms. From this level he watches over faraway places and even other planes of existence using magical scrying pools, telescopes, and other instruments. The children of Sydon and Lutheria spend most of their time on this level, learning from Sydon and preparing to take on the mantles of godhood from the Five. The children are named after the brothers and sisters that Sydon and Lutheria betrayed millennia ago: {@bold Talieus}, {@bold Hergeron}, {@bold Chalcia}, {@bold Goloron} and {@bold Yala}. All of their children are {@creature young empyrean|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|young empyreans}.": "普拉克西斯（Praxys）的王座层是风暴领主赛登（Sydon）的居所。在这个层面上，他通过魔法水晶球、望远镜和其他仪器监视遥远的地方，甚至是其他存在的位面。赛登和卢瑟莉亚（Lutheria）的子女大部分时间都在这个层面上，向赛登学习，并准备从五位神灵那里接过神力的职责。这些子女以赛登和卢瑟莉亚数千年前背叛的兄弟姐妹的名字命名：{@bold Talieus}、{@bold Hergeron}、{@bold Chalcia}、{@bold Goloron}和{@bold Yala}。他们的所有子女都是{@creature young empyrean|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|young empyreans}。",
	"The whole level is also a museum and gallery. Sydon keeps trophies from his triumphs here—a measure of his vainglorious love for himself—and artifacts of great power. This self-aggrandizement continues with the many statues of Sydon, showing him in all kinds of flattering ways: as a warrior, a judge, a philosopher, a father, a king, a giver of wisdom, a singer of songs, and a mighty hunter. Beautiful murals depict the history of Sydon and Lutheria in the most flattering light possible. Sydon is a boastful creature who has no qualms celebrating his own greatness.": "整个层级也是一个博物馆和画廊。赛登在这里展示他的胜利奖杯——这是他对自己虚荣的爱的体现——以及一些具有强大力量的文物。这种自我吹嘘的行为体现在许多赛登的雕像上，展示他以各种令人满意的方式：作为一名战士、一名法官、一名哲学家、一名父亲、一名国王、一名智慧的传授者、一名歌唱家和一名强大的猎人。美丽的壁画生动地描绘了赛登和卢瑟里亚的历史，尽可能地展现了最令人满意的一面。赛登是一个毫不掩饰地庆祝自己伟大的生物。",
	"This lavish, massive chamber is a throne room built for Titans. It is dominated by six majestic thrones arranged in a semicircle.

He expects the same groveling obedience and worship from the dragons.": "如果英雄们选择在泰坦面前鞠躬，赛登(Sydon)将提出一系列羞辱性的要求：放下武器，脱掉盔甲，亲吻大地，向他的名字致敬。他并不打算饶恕英雄们——他只是想看到他们在被处决之前被羞辱。他期望龙也展现同样的卑躬屈膝、顺从和崇拜。",
	"If the heroes play along with Sydon and declare to you that they are doing so, then they automatically have advantage on the first round of attacks they make. Sydon is a vain creature who believes that his magnificence inspires obedience in mortals. It takes him a moment to gather his wits—how could the heroes, who are so obviously defeated, dare to choose defiance instead of cringing obedience?": "如果英雄们跟随西顿并向你宣称他们这样做，那么他们在进行的第一轮攻击中自动获得优势。西顿是一个自负的生物，相信他的壮丽会激发凡人的服从。他需要一点时间来收拾思绪——这些明显被打败的英雄，怎么敢选择抗拒而不是谄媚的服从呢？",
	"Sydon and his entire entourage fight to the death. No dirty trick or underhanded tactic is beneath them. Sydon concentrates his attacks on the dragons first, but he always switches his focus to the creature that damaged him most recently. He takes every attack personally, growing angrier each round.

	"If Lutheria has allied with the heroes for any reason, Sydon declares that she's betrayed him one too many times.

	"If Sydon wins this battle, then the adventure ends at this point. The heroes will forever be remembered in fables as the doltish mortals who challenged a Titan and were punished accordingly. The party's failure is absolute. If you would like to give the party a second try, then it must come at a terrible cost— they may be revived by Mytros or the Fates, but none of the dragons should survive the ensuing battle.": "如果Sydon赢得这场战斗，那么冒险就会在这一点结束。英雄们将永远被记载在寓言中，作为那些挑战泰坦的愚蠢凡人，并受到相应的惩罚。队伍的失败是绝对的。如果你想给队伍第二次机会，那么它必须付出惨重的代价——他们可以被Mytros或命运复活，但是没有一条龙应该在随后的战斗中幸存下来。",
	"If Sydon is defeated, a shockwave of power bursts from him. The sky darkens, and a powerful storm rages overhead. Tremendous winds tear through the streets of Mytros, and rain lashes down, soaking everything.

	"If the heroes fail to stop Lutheria, then the people of Mytros will begin the \"Great Feast.\" They roast each other alive and devour their own families. Lutheria giggles and explains this to the heroes—it's the greatest practical joke in the history of Thylea! She repeatedly licks the spit-roasted pig and offers it to the heroes, struggling to contain her laughter.": "如果英雄们未能阻止卢瑟莉亚，那么迈特洛斯的人们将开始\"盛大盛宴\"。他们会活活烤熟对方，吞食自己的家人。卢瑟莉亚咯咯笑着向英雄们解释——这是蒂莱亚历史上最伟大的恶作剧！她一遍又一遍地舔着旋转烤猪，然后把它递给英雄们，努力忍住笑声。",
	"Eventually, Lutheria tires of telling her jokes. As long as the heroes engage her in worthwhile conversation, she holds her temper in check. Once she grows bored, her mood turns icy cold, and she attacks. She is immediately joined by an {@creature aurae|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords} nymph and an {@creature erinyes|MM}. Lutheria and her servants fight to the death.": "最终，卢瑟莉亚厌倦了讲笑话。只要英雄们与她进行有意义的对话，她就能控制住自己的脾气。一旦她感到无聊，她的心情就会变得冰冷，然后发起攻击。她立即会有一位{@creature aurae|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}仙女和一位{@creature erinyes|MM}加入战斗。卢瑟莉亚和她的仆从将战斗到死亡。",

	"If you want to be generous, you can let your heroes have a short rest before this battle begins to allow a limited time for recovery. The heroes will need to utilize the full power of both the dragons and the colossus, if possible. Kentimane specifically targets the heroes, which means that the heroes may choose to lure him away from the city and fight him at sea.": "如果你想慷慨一些，你可以让你的英雄在这场战斗开始前休息一下，以便有限的时间恢复体力。英雄们需要充分利用龙和巨像的全部力量，如果可能的话。肯提曼 (Kentimane) 专门针对英雄，这意味着英雄们可以选择引诱他离开城市，在海上与他战斗。",
	"If it seems like the city might be completely destroyed, then Vallus or Kyrah will sacrifice themselves to drive the titan back.

They took what is rightfully mine, and I will have it back... I will have it back.": "阿瑞斯人已经愚弄我们几个世纪了。他们躲在城墙后面，嘲笑我们软弱无力的决心。我们有力量粉碎他们。他们拿走了属于我的东西，我会拿回来...我会拿回来。",
	"This chapter marks the beginning of a new phase in the story. With the Titans defeated and the gods transformed, Thylea suffers from a power vacuum. Many divine portfolios—battle, music, wisdom, and more—must be filled by new gods, or else chaos will rule. The souls of the dead are adrift, and the storms and seas of Thylea no longer heed a master. Who will don these mantles of power and ascend to become the new pantheon?": "这一章标志着故事进入新阶段。随着泰坦被打败，众神被改变，泰莱亚陷入了权力真空。许多神圣的领域——战斗、音乐、智慧等——必须由新的神祇来填补，否则混乱将统治一切。死者的灵魂漂泊不定，泰莱亚的风暴和海洋再也不听从任何主宰。谁将承担这些权力的重任，成为新的全能神？",
	"The next part of the adventure works best if there has been a break in the story after the {@italic Battle of Mytros}. This break can last several months or even several years. During this time, the heroes have lived through an extended recovery period in the wake of their quest. Even if one or more of the Titans survived, they have been dormant in the time since the battle. Consequently, the citizens of Mytros have had time to regroup, and life in Thylea is just now returning to normal.": "在{@italic Battle of Mytros}之后，如果故事有一段中断，那么接下来的冒险效果最好。这段中断可以持续几个月，甚至几年。在这段时间里，英雄们经历了一段漫长的康复期，从他们的探险中恢复过来。即使一个或多个泰坦生还，自那场战斗以来他们一直处于休眠状态。因此，Mytros的市民有时间重新组织，而Thylea的生活现在才开始恢复正常。",
	"At this point, the heroes are perhaps the most influential mortals in all of Thylea. Their time has been occupied with a number of important activities.": "此刻，这些英雄或许是蒂莱亚（Thylea）所有凡人中影响力最大的。 他们的时间一直被一系列重要活动占据着。",
	"The devastation wrought by the Titans has left large sections of Mytros in ruins, and many people were without homes. The heroes inspired many of the refugees to set out into the world and build new homes. These refugees founded new settlements, and each new settlement chose one of the heroes as its patron.": "泰坦所带来的破坏使迈特洛斯的许多地区变成废墟，许多人无家可归。英雄们激励了许多难民踏上旅途，建立新家园。这些难民建立了新的定居点，每个新的定居点选择了一个英雄作为其守护者。",
	"Each new settlement is named after its patron hero. For example, a hero named Tiberius might inspire the settlement of \"Tiberia.\" Temples and shrines have been built in the hero's honor, and festivals are held to celebrate when the hero visits. This is a great opportunity to make maximum use of the {@table Table of Fame Rewards|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}. ": "每个新的定居点都以其赞助英雄的名字命名。例如，一个名叫Tiberius的英雄可能会启发建立“Tiberia”定居点。为了纪念这位英雄，人们建造了寺庙和神殿，并举行庆祝活动来庆祝英雄的到访。这是最大程度利用{@table Table of Fame Rewards|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}的绝佳机会。",
	"These new settlements can be located anywhere on the world map of Thylea, but there are a number of places that make the most geographical sense. Refer to the revised world map in the {@adventure Apokalypsis|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|15} chapter, which includes markers for seven new settlements.": "这些新定居点可以位于泰莱亚世界地图的任何地方，但有一些地方在地理上更合理。请参考第{@adventure Apokalypsis|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords|15}章中修订后的世界地图，其中标有七个新定居点的标记。",
	"You might choose to run several roleplaying sessions where players work through the aftermath of the {@italic Battle of Mytros} and the founding of the new settlements. Alternatively, you can ask each player to write you a letter describing what their character has been doing during the break.": "你可以选择进行几次角色扮演游戏会话，让玩家们一起经历{@italic Battle of Mytros}的后果和新定居点的建立。或者，你可以要求每位玩家给你写一封信，描述他们的角色在休息期间都在做些什么。",
	"The heroes are the leaders of a new organization of Dragonlords. As the leaders of such a prestigious order, they are entrusted as the new \"peacekeepers of Thylea.\" They are expected to mediate when kingdoms threaten to go to war and strike against those who would do harm to the people of Thylea. In addition, they must create a legacy for the Order of Dragonlords that will stand the test of time. They must search for worthy new candidates to join the order and track down rare dragon eggs that can be raised as mounts for new recruits.": "英雄们是新组建的龙领主组织的领袖。作为如此负责任的秩序领袖，他们被委以\"蒂莉亚的和平维护者\"的使命。他们被期望在王国威胁要开战时进行调停，并打击那些对蒂莉亚人民造成伤害的人。此外，他们必须为龙领主团创造一个经得起时间考验的传奇。他们必须寻找有资格的新候选人加入团队，并追踪稀有的龙蛋，以便将其培育成新成员的坐骑。",
	"One of the heroes may have married Queen Vallus to become the new king or queen of Mytros. Another may have become the consort to Queen Anora of Estoria. These heroes are now co-rulers of some of the most prominent cities in all of Thylea.": "其中一位英雄可能已经娶了女王瓦卢斯(Queen Vallus)成为迈特洛斯(Mytros)的新国王或女王。另一位可能已成为埃斯托利亚(Estoria)女王阿诺拉(Queen Anora)的配偶。这些英雄现在是泰利亚(Thylea)一些最重要城市的共同统治者。",
	"Additionally, if they have the necessary funds, each hero may choose to dedicate 25,000 gp to the settlement that they patronize. In this case, the settlement has already grown into a bustling city, and the hero is the king or queen of that city.": "另外，如果英雄们有必要的资金，每位英雄可以选择将25,000 gp 捐赠给他们赞助的定居点。在这种情况下，定居点已经发展成一个繁华的城市，而英雄将成为该城市的国王或女王。",

	"The party may siege the city with an army, or they can choose to infiltrate it. Either way, this is an opportunity for the heroes to demonstrate leadership qualities and prove that they are worthy of the mantle of Dragonlords. The city also provides the party with a chance to explore and roleplay.": "该队伍可以率领军队围攻这座城市，或者选择潜入其中。无论哪种方式，这都是英雄展现领导才能、证明自己配得上龙领主之名的机会。这座城市也为队伍提供了探索和角色扮演的机会。",
	"The party must recover one of the Divine Artifacts, the Caduceus, from this tomb. Karpathos is an ancient vampire lord from Aresia.": "队伍必须从这个墓穴中夺回一个神圣 Relic，魔杖 (%Caduceus%)。Karpathos 是来自 Aresia 的古老吸血鬼领主。",

	"The heroes receive a plea to help Narsus, the lost god of beauty. Narsus is the lost brother of Kyrah, Pythor, and Vallus. They rarely speak of him, because he is self-absorbed and selfish—obsessed with the incomparable beauty that he attained when he was transformed from a dragon into a god. Narsus refused to aid the settlers during the First War, and his family consequently disowned him.": "英雄们收到一封请求，希望帮助美神纳尔苏斯（Narsus）。纳尔苏斯是凯拉（Kyrah）、派瑟（Pythor）和瓦卢斯（Vallus）的失踪兄弟。他们很少提及他，因为他自恋且自私，沉迷于他从龙变成神时获得的无与伦比的美丽。纳尔苏斯拒绝在第一次战争期间帮助定居者，因此他的家人断绝了与他的关系。",
	"After the end of the First War, Narsus staged a competition to choose a woman worthy of being his wife. His suitors were to bring him the silver antlers of an elusive white stag. Many of the most powerful and influential women in the world participated in the contest, but the victor was an oread huntress named Ekoh. Tragically, she was never able to claim her prize. Queen Calliope of Aresia became obsessed with Narsus—she took him captive and fled back to her city.": "第一次战争结束后，纳尔萨斯举办了一场比赛，选择一位配得上成为他妻子的女人。求婚者们必须给他带来一只难以捕捉的白色大鹿的银色鹿角。世界上许多最有权势和影响力的女性参加了比赛，但胜利者是一位名叫艾科（Ekoh）的山精猎手。不幸的是，她从未能够领取她的奖品。阿瑞西亚（Aresia）女王卡利奥佩（Calliope）对纳尔萨斯着了迷，她将他俘虏并逃回她的城市。",
	"Narsus has been held in Aresia for 500 years, and the city of Mytros has launched many campaigns to recover the god of beauty without success. The two cities now have a long history of grievances which have eclipsed the original conflict. But with the return of the Dragonlords, Ekoh wishes to siege Aresia and take back her husband once and for all.": "纳尔苏斯(Narsus)在阿瑞西亚(Aresia)被囚禁了500年，而密特洛斯(Mytros)城发起了许多次未成功的活动来夺回这位美之神。这两座城市现在有着悠久的仇恨历史，已经超越了最初的冲突。但随着龙领主(Dragonlords)的回归，艾科(Ekoh)希望围攻阿瑞西亚，并彻底夺回她的丈夫。",
	"Ekoh meets with the heroes in Mytros and pleads her case. Knowing that the heroes are unlikely to start a war between Thylea's two greatest cities over such an ancient dispute, Ekoh tempts them with a more powerful incentive: her lost love has learned the path that mortals must walk to become gods.": "Ekoh在米特洛斯与英雄们会面，并陈述她的理由。知道英雄们不太可能因为这样一个古老的争端而在泰勒亚的两大城市之间发动战争，Ekoh用一个更强大的诱因来引诱他们：她失去的爱人已经学会了凡人必须走的成为神的道路。",
	"With the end of the Oath of Peace, Narsus returned to his dragon form. In the time that has passed, he has researched a means to reclaim the beautiful form that was lost to him. He now seeks to share these secrets with any mortals who come to his aid—anyone who rescues him from the clutches of the Aresian queen. Narsus proposes to create a new pantheon, with the heroes as his fellow gods and goddesses.": "随着和平誓约的结束，纳尔苏斯回到了他的龙形态。在过去的时间里，他研究了一种方法来夺回失去的美丽形态。他现在寻求与任何帮助他的凡人分享这些秘密——任何救他脱离阿瑞西亚女王魔掌的人。纳尔苏斯提议创建一个新的万神殿，让这些英雄成为他的同僚神祇。",
	"Ah, Narsus, You were never much good in a fight, even as a dragon. I am not certain whether it was a cruelty or a kindness when fate awarded you the divine power of Beauty, but one thing's for certain: it went to your head and made you insufferable.": "啊，纳尔萨斯(Narsus)，即使作为一只龙，你在战斗中从来都不擅长。我不确定命运将神圣之力赋予你美的力量是残酷还是善良，但有一点是肯定的：这让你自负到了极致，让你变得令人难以忍受。",

	"From her appearance, it's clear that she is an oread—a mountain nymph. Her skin is like polished obsidian, while her hair is like freshly-fallen snow. She stands tall and proud, with sharply defined features that give her a striking and commanding presence.": "从她的外表来看，很明显她是一位奥瑞亚德（oread）—一位山林仙女。她的皮肤如同抛光的黑曜石，而她的头发则像刚刚落下的雪一样。她站立得高高的，显得自豪而挺拔，她那锐利的面部特征赋予她一种引人注目和威严的气质。",
	"\"Five hundred years ago, my betrothed—Narsus, the God of Beauty—was stolen away from me by the queen of Aresia.

	"Ekoh is vague on the details, she is absolutely confident that Narsus has the ability to elevate the heroes to true godhood.

If such a ritual actually exists, then who better but a god to discover it?": "Ekoh对细节模糊不清，她绝对相信Narsus有能力将英雄提升至真神的地步。在Mytros的学院中，“神圣之路”是一个被深入研究的概念，但大多数只是一堆神话传说。如果这样的仪式真的存在，那么有谁比神更适合去发现呢？",
	"Ekoh presses the heroes to gather the armies of Mytros and Estoria to lay siege to Aresia so they can force Queen Helen to hand over her betrothed.

	"After listening to Ekoh's proposal, the party will have much to discuss. If possible, they should consult with one of the Five Gods.

	"\"Narsus was self-absorbed, selfish, and obsessed with the beauty that he attained when he was transformed from a dragon into a god. In his vanity, he lost his way.

	"These are only two possible ways for the heroes to reach Narsus.

She is willing to lead the heroes into the city, but she also reveals the location of the Palladium—it's in the basement of the Queen's Palace (A2).

Failure would force the party to negotiate or use stealth.": "英雄们站在进攻主门的最前线，他们必须面对阿瑞西亚(Aresia)最著名的战士。如果英雄们获胜，那么大门被攻破，他们的军队涌入城市的西部区域。如果英雄们失败，那么大门保持关闭，进攻的军队士气低落。失败将迫使队伍进行谈判或使用隐秘行动。",
	"The defenders at the gate are Leandros, Halcyon, and Laertes (martial masters). They are the commanders of some of Aresia's greatest fighting forces (A2, A6, A7).

	"Once the gates are breached, the heroes lead the armies through the street of Aresia toward the palace. To reach the palace, they must cross one of the bridges.

If the battle is lost, then the attacking army is routed.": "一旦城门被攻破，英雄们带领军队穿过阿瑞西亚的街道，前往宫殿。为了到达宫殿，他们必须穿过其中一座桥。这就是阿瑞西亚最后一战的发生地。如果队伍赢得这场战斗，那么城市就会陷落，海伦女王被俘，纳尔苏斯被释放。如果战斗失败，那么进攻的军队会溃败。",

But he has no real interest in being rescued.": "纳尔苏斯(Narsus)无论英雄们如何设法获得他的青睐，他的行为都是一样的——就像一只骄傲的小狗，对获得这个机会所需的所有死亡和破坏一无所知。尽管他最初感到沮丧，但在派对到来时明显变得开心起来。他听说过英雄们的故事，对他们的到来感到兴奋。但他并不真正对被解救感兴趣。",
	"Narsus doesn't care about Aresia or Mytros. He likes Queen Helen, because she attends to his every need. He's mostly forgotten about Ekoh. Narsus really only cares about himself. He wants to become a god again, so that he can regain his legendary beauty. He can still polymorph into his human guise, but he's lost the divine luster that he once possessed.": "纳尔萨斯(Narsus)不在乎阿瑞西亚(Aresia)或迈特洛斯(Mytros)。他喜欢海伦女王(Queen Helen)，因为她关心他的一切需求。他几乎忘记了艾科(Ekoh)。纳尔萨斯真的只在乎自己。他想再次成为一个神，这样他就可以恢复他传奇般的美丽。他仍然可以变成他的人类形态，但他已经失去了曾经拥有的神圣光辉。",

	"When the heroes return to Narsus with the Caduceus, the Ambrosia, and the Promethean Fire, he will perform a ritual.

Refer to the Divine Path appendix for details.": "当英雄们带着(Caduceus)、(Ambrosia)和(Promethean Fire)回到纳尔萨斯身边时，他将进行一场仪式。虽然这个仪式并不会让英雄们成为神，但它会打开通往神圣之路的大门。纳尔萨斯在这一点上恢复了他的神格，并分享了英雄们在加入他之前必须完成的任务。有关详细信息，请参考《神圣之路》附录。",
	"The city of Aresia is the largest settlement in the Aresian peninsula. It's famed for its martial arts temples, impressive walls, and hanging gardens.

	"The city's walls are the pride of its citizens. They reach 100 ft. in height, so that the ramparts overlook the forest canopy. The river cuts through the center of the city via a system of gates that can be raised and lowered. The gates are wide enough to accommodate one full-sized trireme at a time. Aresia does not have a navy, so there are rarely many ships within the city except for the traders who ferry goods between Aresia and Mytros.": "这座城市的城墙是市民的骄傲。它们高达100英尺，使得城墙可以俯瞰森林树冠。一条河流通过城市中心，通过一套可以升降的闸门。这些闸门足够宽，可以容纳一艘全尺寸的三排桨战舰通过。阿雷西亚(Aresia)没有海军，因此城市内很少有船只，除了那些在阿雷西亚和迈特洛斯(Mytros)之间运送货物的贸易船。",

	"The most beautiful feature of the city is its hanging gardens. The gardens are watered by a system of channels that carry water from the Thrake river.

Narsus is a lazy and vain god, so he isn't in any hurry to leave.": "在过去的500年里，一位女王统治着阿瑞西亚。建国女王名叫卡丽奥佩(Calliope)，她因为将纳尔萨斯(Narsus)带到阿瑞西亚而闻名。她以虚假借口将他吸引到这里，但他从未真正被囚禁，就像密特洛斯(Mytros)的故事所暗示的那样。纳尔萨斯是一个懒惰又虚荣的神，所以他并不急于离开。",
	"The current queen is Helen. She closely monitors the affairs of her palace and the Temple of Narsus, and she makes the final judgements concerning the city's future. However, she leaves most of the tiresome governing to her council of advisors. There was only ever one King of Aresia—Karpathos, the father of Calliope. His history was carefully buried. From Calliope's reign onward, there was never another male monarch. The queens take male consorts, but no queen would suffer a king to be revered above Narsus.": "现任女王是海伦（Helen）。她密切关注宫殿和纳尔苏斯神庙的事务，并就城市未来的事宜做出最终裁决。然而，她将大部分繁琐的统治工作交给了她的顾问团。阿瑞西亚（Aresia）只有一个国王——卡帕索斯（Karpathos），卡利奥佩（Calliope）的父亲。他的历史被小心地掩埋了。从卡利奥佩的统治开始，再也没有出现过男性君主。女王们会有男性伴侣，但没有一位女王会容忍一个国王被尊崇于纳尔苏斯之上。",

On the other hand, Mytros boasts that their armies are unstoppable on the battlefield—but the warrior monks of Aresia have repeatedly razed entire districts of Mytros to the ground.": "在过去的500年里，Aresia和Mytros之间至少发生过十二场战争。这个数字因咨询的历史学家而异：每个城市都声称在至少七场战争中取得了胜利。Aresians经常夸耀说他们的城墙从未被成功攻破过—这是事实，但他们在战场上经常被Mytros的方阵击溃。另一方面，Mytros夸耀说他们的军队在战场上势不可挡—但Aresia的武士僧侣们已经多次将Mytros的整个区域夷为平地。",

Nothing has been stolen—yet.": "Leandros（LN武术大师）是皇家卫队的指挥官。他通常在正式场合中与女王并肩而立，或者在训练场上警惕地注视着卫兵们。由于最近宫殿发生了一系列入室盗窃案，他正在寻找人帮助他进行调查。目前还没有任何东西被盗走。",

	"This temple is full of mirrors, and it has ceilings covered in gold leaf. Despite its name, Narsus rarely comes here. The temple primarily serves as a convent for his priestesses. The priestesses of the temple (LG acolytes) are selected at age 12 for their loyalty to the queen, and they serve for twelve years, retiring at the age of 24. They wear silky gowns and scarves wrapped to conceal everything except their eyes—the queen brooks no competition for the affection of the God of Beauty.": "这座寺庙到处都是镜子，天花板镀满了金箔。尽管名为Narsus，但他很少来这里。这座寺庙主要作为他的女祭司修道院。这座寺庙的女祭司（（LG acolytes））在12岁时因对女王的忠诚而被选中，她们将在接下来的十二年中服役，直到24岁退休。她们穿着丝绸长袍，头巾裹得严严实实，只露出眼睛—女王绝不容许任何对美之神的爱慕者。",
	"The people of Aresia believe that Narsus loves their city and blesses them with his presence. Accordingly, the servants attend to his every need, day and night.": "阿雷西亚人相信纳尔苏斯热爱他们的城市，并用他的存在祝福他们。因此，仆人们日夜侍奉他的一切需求。",

Even on training days, there are delighted onlookers in the stands, whether aspiring young warriors or older Aresians admiring the beauty of the human form.": "每个武术门派的秘密都被限制在他们的寺庙内，体育馆则是战士们希望展示自己训练成果时的场所。即使是训练日，看台上也总有一些欣喜的旁观者，无论是渴望成为年轻战士的人，还是年长的阿瑞西亚人欣赏人体之美。",
	"The most popular and competitive event by far, armed combat is dominated by warriors from the Temple of the Shield. Most events showcase their expertise in the shield-and-spear techniques. Tournament regulations require spears and other weapons to be blunted to minimize injuries, but events are often bloody regardless. There are also champions from other disciplines, including the Temple of the Sword. Warriors from the Temple of Tranquility are famous for taking down armed opponents with simple weapons, such as slings.": "迄今为止最受欢迎和竞争激烈的活动是武装战斗，由盾之殿的战士主导。大多数比赛展示了他们在盾枪技术上的专长。比赛规定要求矛和其他武器要钝化以减少伤害，但比赛往往仍然血腥。还有来自其他流派的冠军，包括剑之殿的战士。来自宁静殿的战士以用简单武器如弹弓击败武装对手而闻名。",

	"The least popular of all the events, shot put competitors throw heavy stones and occasionally hammers. The goal is to launch them as far as possible. In the past, the Temple of the Elements won too many trophies in this event using secret techniques, so they are currently banned from participating.": "在所有比赛项目中，铅球是最不受欢迎的。选手们投掷沉重的石头，有时也会投掷锤子。目标是尽可能远地将它们投出去。过去，元素神殿使用秘密技巧在这个项目中赢得了太多奖杯，因此他们目前被禁止参加。",
	"The interior of this large domed building is humid from steam baths, which have been infused with salts to ease injuries. Lush vegetation and trickling water dampens the noise from the nearby gymnasium.": "这座大圆顶建筑的内部充满了湿气，这是因为蒸汽浴室中添加了盐来缓解受伤。郁郁葱葱的植被和淅沥的流水减轻了附近健身房的噪音。",
	"This sanctuary is attached to the Gymnasium (A4). It includes a small shrine for praying to the gods and an infirmary where warriors can recover from injuries. The shrine is the domed building attached to the gymnasium to the southeast, and the infirmary includes the buildings to the north and east.": "这个圣所连接着体育馆(A4)。它包括一个小神龛，供人们向神祈祷，以及一个让战士们从伤势中恢复的医务室。神龛是连接到体育馆东南部的圆顶建筑，而医务室包括位于北部和东部的建筑。",
	"Many warriors need healing after events and tournaments at the Gymnasium. The head priest here, Lennicus (NE dwarf priest), gambles on the events, and is it rumored that he makes a tidy profit. He goes by the name \"Lenny,\" and he considers it his job to patch up competitors—rather than coddle them — so they can get back into the fight as quickly as possible.": "在体育馆的活动和比赛之后，许多战士需要疗伤。这里的首席祭司，莱尼库斯（(NE dwarf priest)），会在这些活动上赌博，据传他赚了不少钱。他被称为“莱尼”，他认为自己的工作是修补竞争者的伤口，而不是纵容他们，这样他们就能尽快重新投入战斗。",
	"This shrine offers services including healing and other priestly spells. It houses statues of each of the Gods and Titans—competitors come here to pray \"for luck.\" However, it is clear which gods are favored, as Thylea's statue is draped with garlands, and Pythor's is caked with red paint. Narsus's statue is the most elegant of all, shimmering in gold leaf and surrounded by flowers. Kyrah's statue has some offerings (including small paintings and music scrolls), but the statues of Mytros and Vallus are falling into disrepair.": "这座神龛提供治疗和其他神职法术等服务。它供奉了每位神祗和泰坦的雕像——竞争者来这里祈祷“求好运”。然而，很明显哪些神受到偏爱，因为蒂莉亚的雕像上挂满了花环，皮索尔的雕像上沾满了红漆。纳尔苏斯的雕像是最优雅的，镶嵌着金箔，周围环绕着鲜花。凯拉的雕像上有一些供品（包括小画作和乐谱），但迈特洛斯和瓦卢斯的雕像正在破败中。",
	"This temple sits high on a hill just north of the palace, in close proximity to the city's seat of power. Warriors march through this area in disciplined formations, wearing brilliant red cloaks and heavy shields polished to perfection.": "这座寺庙坐落在山顶上，就在宫殿的北面，靠近城市权力中心。战士们以纪律严明的队形穿过这个区域，身穿鲜艳的红色斗篷，手持擦得锃亮的沉重盾牌。",
	"This temple teaches the legendary Aresian fighting style, the Way of the Shield. This is the most prestigious martial arts temple in the city, and masters here teach techniques that have long challenged the fearsome phalanxes of Mytros. The school's reputation is well-earned; this is a highly regimented and organized temple where everything is polished to a spit-shine.": "这座寺庙教授传奇的阿瑞斯风格格斗技巧，即盾之道。这是城市中最负盛名的武术寺庙，这里的大师们教授的技巧长期挑战着迈特洛斯可怕的方阵。这所学校的声誉是当之无愧的；这是一个高度纪律严明和有组织的寺庙，一切都被打磨得锃亮。",
	"As the strictest of the Aresian temples, discipline here is a top priority. In order to maintain the image of the temple, those perceived as soft and slovenly are routinely culled, no matter how impressive their past achievements may be. The temple's proximity to the queen is a symbol of its importance, as their warriors guard the chamber of Narsus himself, located deep within the hill beneath their temple.": "作为最严格的阿瑞斯神庙之一，纪律在这里是首要任务。为了维护神庙的形象，那些被视为软弱和懒散的人经常被淘汰，无论他们过去的成就有多么令人印象深刻。神庙靠近女王的地方象征着它的重要性，因为他们的战士守护着纳尔苏斯本人的宝座室，位于他们神庙下面的山丘深处。",
	"Halcyon (LG human martial master) reigns as Grandmaster of the Shield. She is hyper-competitive, and extremely tough on her students. She expects the absolute best at all times—from others and herself. She has mothered many sons and daughters who are now elite warriors at the Temple of the Shield. Halcyon has been hard on them, and several of them are resentful. But she wants her warriors to make the queen proud—many are eventually selected to join the royal guard.": "Halcyon（(LG 人类武术大师)）是盾之大师。她是一个极具竞争力的人，对她的学生要求极高。她始终期待他人和自己都能发挥出最好的状态。她抚养了许多儿女，他们现在都是盾之殿的精英战士。Halcyon对他们要求严格，有几个人心存怨恨。但她希望她的战士们能让女王感到骄傲——许多人最终被选入皇家卫队。",
	"Located beneath the temple, there is a winding series of caverns concealed within the depths of the hill. This is where Narsus (CN young bronze dragon) resides, attended to by his priestesses and Pyrrha (CG siren mage). The outer chambers are guarded by twenty shield monks (warrior monks), but they are never permitted to enter his chambers. Few besides the priestesses have laid eyes on Narsus in recent years, and the warriors posted here consider it a kind of punishment.": "在寺庙下方，有一系列蜿蜒的洞穴隐藏在山丘的深处。这就是年轻青铜龙Narsus(CN young bronze dragon)的居所，他由他的女祭司和Pyrrha(CG siren mage)照料。外部大厅由二十名盾僧(warrior monks)守卫，但他们从未被允许进入他的房间。近年来，除了女祭司之外，很少有人看到过Narsus，驻扎在这里的战士们认为这是一种惩罚。",
	"Pyrrha is a siren who sings day and night for Narsus. Queen Helen is intensely jealous of her, and has attempted many schemes to get her sent away. However, Narsus is soothed by her singing voice, and refuses to let her leave. Pyrrha is deeply in love with Narsus, but all he's ever said in return is how much he loves her songs. There are whispers that Pyrrha possesses a map to the long lost kingdom of the sirens.": "皮拉(Pyrrha)是一位塞壬，为纳尔萨斯(Narsus)日夜歌唱。海伦女王(Queen Helen)对她嫉妒之极，并多次试图设计让她离开。然而，纳尔萨斯被她的歌声安抚，拒绝让她离开。皮拉深爱着纳尔萨斯，但他唯一回应的是他有多么喜欢她的歌声。有传言说皮拉拥有一张通往失落的塞壬王国的地图。",
	"Whenever the party meets Narsus for the first time, refer to the Audience with Narsus section for narration text and details.": "每当队伍第一次见到Narsus时，请参考《与Narsus的会面》部分的叙述文本和细节。",
	"This temple stands at the top of a long, steep path that winds its way around a forested mountain in the south part of the city. The temple courtyard is decorated with white sand gardens and bamboo fountains. There is little sound except the shuffling of feet and the soft rustling of wind through the trees.": "这座寺庙矗立在城市南部一座郁郁葱葱的山上，山路蜿蜒而上。寺庙庭院装饰着白沙花园和竹制喷泉。除了脚步声和树叶被风吹拂的轻柔声音外，寂静无声。",
	"This temple teaches both the Tranquility and Open Hand monastic traditions. Reaching the temple requires a strenuous hike, but the master here claims that this long walk facilitates contemplation. Younger monks who train at this temple are expected to spend years gathering olives before they are taught any martial techniques. There is a joke among the younger monks that the real lesson of the school is patience, as the master only seems to train those who have turned gray and wrinkled with age. It is no surprise, then, why this school has the highest drop-out rate of any temple in Aresia.": "这座寺庙教授宁静 (Tranquility) 和张手 (Open Hand) 两种修道传统。到达这座寺庙需要艰苦的徒步旅行，但这里的大师声称这段漫长的步行有助于冥想。在这座寺庙接受训练的年轻僧侣被期望在学习任何武术技巧之前花几年时间采摘橄榄。年轻僧侣之间有一个笑话，说这所学校真正的教训是耐心，因为大师似乎只培训那些已经头发变白、满脸皱纹的人。因此，这所学校为什么是 Aresia 中退学率最高的寺庙也就不足为奇了。",
	"Laertes (NG human martial master) has served as Grandmaster of Tranquility for longer than anyone can remember. He is a wizened old man with a seemingly impossible number of wrinkles and a long, braided white beard. While he never states his age, there is speculation that he is at least 500 years old.": "Laertes（(NG 人类武术大师)）担任宁静大师已经有人们记忆不起的时间了。他是一个皱纹众多、留着一根长长的白色辫子的老者。虽然他从不透露自己的年龄，但有人猜测他至少有500岁了。",
	"Laertes famously subsists on a single olive per day, and most of his day is an elaborately-constructed ritual around this single olive. Most of the monks-in-training spend hours walking across the city to the enchanted olive grove, where they pick a single ripe olive at dusk. They must then walk all the way back to present their olives before Laertes, who goes through a lengthy ritual to select a single olive to eat. Laertes rarely speaks, but the monks closest to him believe that he is on the quest to find the perfect olive, and he refuses to die until he's enjoyed it. Many aspiring monks leave the school in frustration, but veteran students profess the wisdom of Laertes: that patience is the key to enlightenment.": "莱尔忒斯（Laertes）以每天一个橄榄果为生，他的大部分时间都围绕着这一个橄榄果展开了一场精心构建的仪式。大多数正在训练的僧侣花费数小时穿过城市前往魔法橄榄园，在黄昏时分摘取一颗成熟的橄榄果。然后他们必须走回去，将他们的橄榄果呈现给莱尔忒斯，他会经过漫长的仪式挑选一颗橄榄果来食用。莱尔忒斯很少开口说话，但离他最近的僧侣们相信他正在寻找完美的橄榄果，他拒绝在享用完之前离世。许多有抱负的僧侣因沮丧而离开学校，但资深学生们宣扬莱尔忒斯的智慧：耐心是开启启蒙之门的关键。",
	"This black temple is located south of the palace, on a hill overlooking the city. The building is deadly quiet and unsettlingly still. In the dark of night, it seems to swallow the light around it.": "这座黑色神庙位于皇宫的南边，坐落在俯瞰城市的山上。这座建筑异常安静，让人感到不安地静止着。在夜晚的黑暗中，它似乎吞噬着周围的光线。",
	"The most secretive of all the temples, this school teaches the monastic tradition called the Way of Shadow. Their members are trained to become spies and assassins, and they often serve as secret police for the queen. They move in the shadows, and their exact numbers are unknown. It is believed that they also have agents in Mytros, to keep an eye on their rival city.": "这所寺庙中最神秘的，教授一种名为暗影之道的僧侣传统。他们的成员接受训练，成为间谍和刺客，通常充当女王的秘密警察。他们潜行于阴影之中，他们的确切人数是未知的。据信他们还在（Mytros）中有特工，以监视他们的竞争对手城市。",
	"It is a closely-guarded secret that students of this temple worship Lutheria. They keep several shrines to the Mistress of Death. At any given time, there are at least three captives here being tortured for information. The queens of Aresia have long suspected this, but they turn a blind eye to it.": "这座寺庙的学生崇拜卢瑟莉亚是一个严守秘密的事实。他们供奉死亡女神建立了多座神龛。在任何时候，至少有三名囚犯在这里被折磨以获取信息。阿瑞西亚的女王们长期以来一直怀疑这一点，但选择视而不见。",

	"The Grandmaster here is called the Shadowmaster, and no one knows her identity—not even her own students. The Shadowmaster disguises herself as a jovial innkeeper at the tavern named Jocasta, (LE elven assassin). This plump elven woman has been the city's spymaster for 500 years, and her loyalty to the throne is waning. She's grown tired of the capricious, selfish queen.": "这里的大师被称为影子大师，没有人知道她的身份——甚至是她自己的学生也不知道。影子大师伪装成一位名为乔卡斯塔的欢快的酒店老板，（LE 高等精灵刺客）。这位丰满的高等精灵女士已经担任这座城市的间谍大师500年，她对王座的忠诚正在减弱。她已经厌倦了这位反复无常、自私的女王。",
	"If the heroes ask questions about Narsus while in Aresia, it is likely that one of Jocasta's spies will notice this and bring them to the Shadowmaster's attention. Jocasta will meet with the heroes and try to strike a deal. She knows where they can find Narsus, but in exchange for that information, she would like them to help her kill the Queen.": "如果英雄们在阿瑞西亚询问纳尔萨斯的事情，很可能会引起乔卡斯塔的间谍注意，并将他们带到影子大师的注意下。乔卡斯塔将会与英雄们会面并试图达成交易。她知道他们可以找到纳尔萨斯的地方，但作为交换，她希望他们帮助她杀死女王。",

	"This temple teaches the monastic tradition called the Way of the Four Elements. They focus on elemental techniques to control air, water, earth, and fire. Unlike the other temples, the students here are less combat focused and instead help with the marketplace and city maintenance. Water and earth specialists help ensure that the marketplace runs smoothly, and assist with stocking and boat traffic. Many of the monks are tasked with management of the city's vital utilities, including the aqueducts, the masonry, lighting and dousing the torches, and more. While elemental monks are not highly respected as warriors in Aresia, they are seen as vital to the city's day-to-day operations.": "这座寺庙教授一种名为四元之道的僧侣传统。他们专注于运用元素技术控制空气、水、土和火。与其他寺庙不同，这里的学生更少关注战斗，而是帮助市场和城市的维护。水和土专家们帮助确保市场运转顺利，并协助补货和船只交通。许多僧侣负责管理城市的重要公共设施，包括引水渠、砌砖、点亮和熄灭火炬等。虽然在阿瑞西亚，元素僧侣并不被视为战士，但他们被视为城市日常运营的重要角色。",
	"An imposing presence, Taureus (NG minotaur berserker) serves as Grandmaster of the Elements. Tall and broad even by minotaur standards, Taureus is jovial but has a keen business sense.

	"Taureus also serves as master of ceremonies at the gymnasium, as his booming voice can be heard from even the highest seats. He specializes in earth-manipulation techniques, and his decade-long winning streak in shot put is the reason why elemental monks have been banned from the event.": "泰勒斯(Taureus)也担任体育馆的礼仪主持人，他的洪亮声音甚至可以从最高的座位听到。他擅长地球操控技术，他在铅球比赛中长达十年的连胜纪录，是元素僧侣被禁止参加该比赛的原因。",

	"Minotaurs are not subject to the same prejudices in Aresia that they are in Mytros. Minotaurs dwell here in peace with their fellow citizens, and bulls are never offered as sacrifices to the gods, out of respect for them. The Aresians are proud of this fact and lord it over the 'barbaric' Mytrosians.": "在阿瑞西亚，牛头人不受到在迈特洛斯中所受到的偏见。牛头人与其他市民和平共处，出于对他们的尊重，绝不会将公牛作为祭品献给神灵。阿瑞西亚人为此感到自豪，并对“野蛮”的迈特洛斯人进行嘲讽。",

	"This shrine serves as a base for the 1,000 scouts who patrol the woods beyond Aresia. The general here shares command of the scouts with the Temple of the Sword (A11). The chimes serve as an indicator of robust trade winds, and those stationed here must grow accustomed to the constant jangling of chimes. When the chimes grow quiet, it usually signals the calm before a storm.": "这座神龛是1,000名侦察兵的基地，他们巡逻在阿瑞西亚（Aresia）之外的树林。这里的将军与剑之殿（A11）共同指挥这些侦察兵。风铃用来指示强劲的贸易风，驻守在这里的人必须习惯于风铃不断地叮当作响。当风铃变得安静时，通常意味着暴风雨来临前的宁静。",
	"The shrine houses a large bronze horn that is used to recall scouts from the wilderness. When the horn blows twice, the keepers of the aqueducts seal the river gates. When the horn blows thrice, all the warriors of Aresia scramble to their posts and line the walls with their spears.

Sailors often visit this statue to pay their respects before setting out on long voyages.": "这座神殿里供奉着一只巨大的青铜号角，用于将侦察员从荒野中召回。当号角响两次时，引水渠的守护者会关闭河闸。当号角响三次时，所有阿瑞西亚的战士都会迅速赶往自己的岗位，用长矛排列在城墙上。这只号角是由西顿赠送给这座城市的，并由一尊巨大的风暴泰坦雕像支撑着。水手们经常在启程远航前来这座雕像前致敬。",
	"As commander of a thousand scouts scattered in the wilderness, General Niobe (LN gladiator) has one of the hardest jobs in the city.

	"Niobe has a longstanding crush on Hiero, Grandmaster of the Temple of the Sword (A11), a reserved man with whom she's worked intimately for decades.

If the party is intrested in helping her, then they should speak to Hiero.": "妮奥比（Niobe）长期暗恋着剑庙（（Temple of the Sword (A11)）大师（Grandmaster）海罗（Hiero），这位性格内敛的男士与她合作多年。她每年都会向他求婚，但他拒绝了，声称自己的荣誉恢复之前不能结婚。如果队伍有兴趣帮助她，他们应该与海罗交谈。",
	"This humble temple rests on a small hill that overlooks the northeastern gate of Aresia. It has no special ornamentation, save for the temple's symbol, forged in iron.

	"This temple is responsible for guarding the two northern gates of the city, both land and river. This is the smallest martial temple, having no formal recruitment process. The masters here emphasize self-discipline and training in total silence. They follow the stoic philosophy of showing humility before the gods, focusing on doing good work—and most importantly, not complaining or asking for more.

The masters only draw their sword when they intend to cut the enemy.": "这座寺庙负责守护城市的两个北门，分别是陆地和河流。这是最小的武术寺庙，没有正式的招募程序。这里的大师们强调自律和全程无声的训练。他们遵循斯多嘉哲学，向神灵展示谦卑，专注于做好事情——最重要的是，不抱怨或索取更多。盾僧用铁腕强化纪律，而剑僧则被期望自然地培养纪律。大师们只有在打算斩杀敌人时才拔剑。",
	"Grandmaster Hiero (LG, half-elven veteran) never sought to be a leader. He earned his title after many battles against the armies of Mytros. During one such battle, Hiero won an ancient mithral honorblade, and for years he believed that he was worthy of the sword.": "大宗师海罗（(LG, 半精灵老兵)）从未追求成为领袖。在与迈特洛斯的军队进行多次战斗后，他获得了这个头衔。在一次战斗中，海罗赢得了一把古老的秘银荣誉之刃，多年来他一直相信自己配得上这把剑。",
	"Recently, Hiero was defeated in a duel by the mad warlord, Zakroth, who severed his right arm and claimed the honorblade as a trophy. Hiero has lived all his life as a stoic—he accepts his failure, but it has left him just a shadow of his former self. If the party returns the blade to him, then he will be deeply moved, and he will finally agree to marry Niobe (A10).": "最近，海罗在一场决斗中被疯狂的战争领主扎克罗斯击败，他的右臂被截断，并且将荣誉之刃作为战利品。海罗一直过着禁欲的生活——他接受了失败，但这让他变得只剩下他曾经的一小部分。如果队伍将刀交还给他，他将深受感动，并最终同意娶妮奥比（A10）。",

	"As the chief source of olives and olive oil, Aresia offers them at a bargain and sells many olive-themed treats and goods for tourists. Many of the imported goods come from Mytros—everything from wine to metals, cloth, and dry goods. Occasionally, the market drawsprotestors who claim that many Mytrosian goods are made with slave labor, but most turn a blind eye, as both cities depend on a healthy trade relationship.": "作为橄榄和橄榄油的主要来源，阿雷西亚以优惠的价格提供这些产品，并为游客销售许多以橄榄为主题的美食和商品。许多进口商品来自米特洛斯（Mytros）—从葡萄酒到金属、布料和干货应有尽有。偶尔，市场会吸引抗议者，声称许多米特洛斯商品是用奴隶劳工制造的，但大多数人选择视而不见，因为两个城市都依赖于健康的贸易关系。",

	"Inside the gallery, there is a well-guarded painting of the First Aresian King, Karpathos the Wolf Lord. The painting is rumored to be enchanted—the painter was so talented that he supposedly captured the king's soul. It is rumored that someone in Mytros wants to buy it for 20,000 gold.": "画廊内有一幅备受守护的画作，描绘了第一任阿瑞西亚国王，狼王卡帕索斯(Karpathos the Wolf Lord)。传言称这幅画被施加了魔法——画家的技艺高超到能够捕捉国王的灵魂。有传言称，迷特洛斯(Mytros)中有人愿意以2万金币购买它。",
	"If the painting is destroyed, it removes Karpathos's ability to assume gaseous form. This means that if he is ever reduced to 0 hit points, he is destroyed forever. This is valuable information that Jocasta (the Shadowmaster) will share with the heroes as a way to gain their trust.": "如果这幅画被摧毁，卡帕索斯将失去变为气态的能力。这意味着如果他的生命值降低到0，他将永远被摧毁。这是乔卡斯塔（影子大师）将与英雄们分享以赢得他们信任的宝贵信息。",
	"Pelegon (LG human commoner) is the most famous portraitist in Aresia. He has been perfecting his art for decades, and came to Aresia to paint Narsus. However, Narsus has refused to appear, and Pelegon has been the vocal leader of a protest, demanding to see Narsus. He has organized the Artists' Guild, a group of the best portraitists, landscape artists, and more, who now refuse to paint for the queen until Narsus is released. Pelegon offers to paint splendid portraits of all the heroes if they agree to bring him to the Chamber of Beauty (A6).": "佩莱贡（LG 人类平民）是阿瑞西亚最著名的肖像画家。他已经致力于完善自己的艺术数十年，并前来阿瑞西亚为纳尔苏斯绘画。然而，纳尔苏斯拒绝露面，佩莱贡一直是抗议活动的主要发起人，要求见到纳尔苏斯。他组织了艺术家公会，这是一群最优秀的肖像画家、风景画家等，他们现在拒绝为女王绘画，直到纳尔苏斯被释放。佩莱贡提议，如果英雄们同意带他去美丽之厅（A6），他将为所有英雄绘制精美的肖像。",

	"This building is the headquarters for the Coalition of Merchants, an organization led by Aketa (NG tiefling merchant). Aketa was born in Mytros and raised in Aresia.

The constant influx of gold and goods has created long-standing stability in spite of centuries of sporadic warfare.": "这座建筑是商人联盟的总部，这个组织由阿凯塔（(NG tiefling merchant)）领导。阿凯塔出生在迈特洛斯，成长在阿瑞西亚。她负责处理到达的船只，并向与迈特洛斯进行贸易的水手们授予委托。商人联盟代表来自这两座城市的商人，他们共同努力促进贸易。大量的黄金和商品不断涌入，尽管经历了几个世纪的零星战争，但已经创造了长期的稳定。",
	"Aketa has long been obsessed with finding the legendary lost City of the Sirens. When the party obtains the map to the Sunken Kingdom, Aketa may reach out and offer to fund the expedition in exchange for a small portion (10% gold value) of the treasure. She can finance ships, crew, and other equipment. She offers the party seven scrolls of waterbreathing as a gesture of respect and good will.": "阿凯塔长久以来一直着迷于寻找传说中失落的塞壬之城。当队伍获得沉没王国的地图时，阿凯塔可能会联系并提议资助探险，以换取宝藏的一小部分（10%的黄金价值）。她可以提供资金支持用于船只、船员和其他装备。她向队伍提供了七卷水下呼吸的卷轴，作为尊重和善意的表示。",

The army is commanded by Zakroth, an evil minotaur warlord who seeks to become a god.": "这座堡垒是最近建造的。它是为了收容来自许多不同半人马和牛头人部落的人质而建的，他们已经聚集成一支可怕的军队。这支军队由扎克洛斯(Zakroth)指挥，他是一个邪恶的牛头人战争领主，渴望成为一位神。",

	"During his travels, Zakroth came into possession of an artifact called the Ambrosia. Drinking from this amphora grants Zakroth unnatural charisma, which he uses to manipulate his followers. Zakroth knows that the Ambrosia is one of the Divine Artifacts, and he desperately seeks to obtain the other two, so that he can ascend to godhood.": "在他的旅途中，扎克罗斯（Zakroth）得到了一件叫做圣神酒（Ambrosia）的神器。从这个圣酒的酒罐中喝下去，会赋予扎克罗斯一种超自然的魅力，他利用这种魅力来操纵他的追随者。扎克罗斯知道圣神酒是三大神器之一，他拼命寻找另外两个，以便能够升格为神明。",

	"Zakroth's unnatural charisma makes him a cunning liar. He has convinced the gigantes that he was chosen by the Titan Hergeron to lead the gigantes tribes.

	"Through a break in the dense fir trees, an earthen mass rises above the forest canopy. At first it appears to be a natural formation, but then you notice the broad entryway at the base. The fortress stands more than one hundred feet in height, with rough openings that serve as windows. You hear the sounds of clacking hooves and the rhythmic beat of war drums from within.": "穿过密密的冷杉树间的一处裂缝，一座土堆在森林树冠之上耸立。起初它看起来像是一个自然形成物，但随后你注意到了底部宽阔的入口。这座要塞高达一百多英尺，有粗糙的开口作为窗户。你从内部听到了马蹄的嗒嗒声和战鼓的有节奏的敲击声。",
	"All of the ceilings are 20 ft. in height unless otherwise noted. All of the doors are made from wood unless otherwise noted. There are two types of doors. The small doors are 5 ft. wide and 15 ft. high. The double doors consist of two doors, each 5 ft. wide and 20 ft. high. Opening a double door is trivial for a Large-sized creature, but smaller creatures must use an action.": "所有的天花板高度为20英尺，除非另有说明。所有的门都是木制的，除非另有说明。有两种类型的门。小门宽5英尺，高15英尺。双开门由两扇门组成，每扇门宽5英尺，高20英尺。对于大型生物来说，打开双开门是微不足道的，但较小生物必须使用一个动作。",
	"All of the rooms are dimly lit by natural light that shines through gaps in the wooden walls. At night, all the rooms are pitch black.": "所有的房间都被透过木墙缝隙照射进来的自然光昏暗地照亮。在晚上，所有的房间都是漆黑一片。",
	"At some point during the party's time inside the fortress, a gigantes war party returns. The war party consists of 4 gigantes and 1 gigantes witch. If the heroes have left behind any evidence of their intrusion (e.g. leaving behind dead bodies), then the war party will search them out. They might arrive as reinforcements to a fight or just as an additional encounter.": "在洞堡内的某个时刻，一个巨人战队返回了。这支战队由4名巨人和1名巨人女巫组成。如果英雄们留下了任何入侵的证据（例如留下了尸体），那么战队会搜寻他们。他们可能会作为增援出现在战斗中，或者作为额外的遭遇。",
	"The stench of death hangs heavily in the humid air of this entryway. In the dim light, you can see six rough wooden crosses laid in a haphazard pattern across the wide courtyard, with twisted, rotting corpses nailed to them. Many wear the tattered remains of crimson cloaks. Flies swarm and buzz around them.": "在这个入口处，死亡的恶臭在潮湿的空气中弥漫。在昏暗的光线下，你可以看到六个粗糙的木十字架散乱地摆放在宽阔的庭院中，上面钉着扭曲腐烂的尸体。许多尸体穿着残破的深红斗篷。苍蝇围绕着它们嗡嗡作响。",

	"If Ugulat is healed, he explains the situation to the party. He describes Zakroth's history, and he says that the minotaur has clearly gone mad with power. He knows that the fort is guarded by gigantes and minotaurs. He saw a single centaur arrive a few days ago.": "如果乌古拉（Ugulat）被治愈，他会向队伍解释情况。他描述了扎克洛斯（Zakroth）的历史，并说这个牛头怪显然已经被权力冲昏了头脑。他知道这座堡垒由巨人和牛头怪守卫。他看到几天前有一只半人马到达。",
	"The scent of manure is overpowering in this area. Gleaming eyes can be seen in the dim lights, and soft bleats and snorts are offered almost apologetically.

	"Very little light filters from the rafters to the central stair. This appears to be the core of the fortress. Huge wooden planks have been inserted into an enormous tree.

The roof of the structure can be seen high above, indicating the stairs will reach as far as the uppermost floor.": "从屋顶的横梁中透过的光线很少，直通中央楼梯。这似乎是堡垒的核心。巨大的木板被插入一棵巨大的树中。木板螺旋向上，像一座楼梯，但它们的间距超过三英尺。结构的屋顶可以看到高高在上，表明楼梯将延伸至最高楼层。",
	"The central stair is guarded by Murgrat (gigantes). Murgrat is young and more curious than most of his kind. He greets the party and asks their names. Then he proudly explains that he is one of Zakroth's warriors, and Zakroth is \"Hergeron's Chosen.\" He and his brothers and sisters plan to eat all the mortals in Thylea, and then Hergeron the Titan will be resurrected so that he can put the finishing touches on the gigantes race. As Murgrat explains all of this, he draws closer to the party, and his poisonous saliva splashes onto the floor. Eventually, he attacks the party and tries to eat them.": "中央楼梯被莫格拉特（巨人）守护着。莫格拉特年轻，比大多数同类更好奇。他向队伍打招呼并询问他们的名字。然后他自豪地解释说他是扎克罗斯的战士之一，而扎克罗斯是“赫尔杰隆之选”。他和他的兄弟姐妹计划吃掉泰莱亚的所有凡人，然后泰坦赫尔杰隆将被复活，以便他可以为巨人族做最后的润色。当莫格拉特解释所有这些时，他逐渐靠近队伍，他有毒的唾液溅到地板上。最终，他袭击队伍并试图吞食他们。",
	"The smell of death and rotting meat fills the air of this room. In the center of the bloodstained floor are hunks of meat and the remains of butchered livestock. The freshest carcasses are crawling with flies, as are several large pools of sticky blood.": "这个房间充斥着死亡和腐烂肉的气味。在满是血迹的地板中央，散落着肉块和屠宰牲畜的残骸。最新鲜的尸体上爬满了苍蝇，几处大型血迹池也是如此。",
	"This is where livestock is taken to be butchered for meat. Currently a minotaur hero is butchering the carcass of a cow.

A wide, shallow trough runs down the middle of the floor, channeling the blood into a pool where it is collected for later use.": "十几头猪和牛的剥皮尸体被吊在天花板上的钩子上，它们流出的血液像雨水一样滴落下来。一条宽阔而浅的槽沿着地板中央延伸，将血液引导到一个池中，以便后续使用。",

	"This kitchen is full of sharp knives, forks, and other wicked-looking utensils. Mountains of raw meat sit on crushed ice, vegetables are piled in enormous barrels, and giant tubs of water line the walls.": "这个厨房里摆满了锋利的刀、叉和其他看起来邪恶的器具。成堆的生肉放在碎冰上，蔬菜堆在巨大的桶里，墙边摆满了巨大的水桶。",
	"The kitchen is managed by a trio of maenads who were sent by Lutheria to assist Zakroth. They hate Zakroth, but they will do anything to serve the Mistress of Death.": "厨房由三位狂热女神管理，她们是由卢瑟莉亚派遣来协助扎克罗斯的。她们讨厌扎克罗斯，但愿意为死亡女神服务，不惜一切。",
	"If the heroes killed Lutheria, then the maenads taunt the party: \"Wretched mortals, Lutheria is very angry with you. Did you really think you could kill the goddess of death?\" Eventually, the maenads summon the minotaur hero from the Slaughterhouse (Z4) and fight to the death.": "如果英雄们杀死了卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria)，那么狂女们会嘲讽着对着队伍说：“可怜的凡人，卢瑟莉亚对你们很生气。你们真的以为你们能杀死死亡女神吗？”最终，狂女们会召唤屠宰场(Z4)中的牛头人英雄，并与其战斗到死。",
	"These chambers resonate with deep, raspy snores. The walls are lined with large woven mats and giant lumpy pillows. Two hulking forms are curled up on the largest mats—the source of the deafening snores.": "这些房间回荡着深沉而嘶哑的鼾声。墙壁上挂满了大型编织垫和巨大的垫子。两个庞大的身影蜷缩在最大的垫子上——发出震耳欲聋的鼾声的源头。",

	"This enormous hall spans almost the entire width of the tower. Savory scents fill the air. A huge table sits at the center, standing eight feet high, with a dozen oversized chairs scattered around it. Six gigantes recline in the chairs, slurping and smacking noisily as they shovel food into their mouths with their hands.": "这个巨大的大厅几乎横跨整个塔楼的宽度。空气中弥漫着美味的香味。一个巨大的桌子坐落在中央，高达八英尺，周围散落着一打超大号的椅子。六个巨人斜躺在椅子上，大声地啜饮和啪嗒啪嗒地吃着食物，用手把食物塞进嘴里。",
	"This is where most of the gigantes garrison can usually be found. There are four gigantes and two gigantes witches eating messily at the table. They attack trespassers on sight.

If the party wields the Caduceus, then they sense that they have a choice: they can use the staff to put these souls to rest, or they can use the staff to swallow the souls. Swallowing the souls adds one charge of create undead to the staff.": "当冒险队最终离开古墓时，阴影继续跟随着他们。如果冒险队持有(Caduceus)，那么他们会感觉到有一个选择：他们可以使用这根法杖让这些灵魂安息，或者他们可以使用法杖吞噬这些灵魂。吞噬灵魂会给法杖增加一个(create undead)的充能。",
	"Ten minutes after the entrance of the tomb has been unsealed, a pack of four nuckle will enter.

Before he was exiled, he managed to steal the Promethean Fire. He wandered the planes for centuries before coming to the lands of Thylea. During his travels, he despised the tyranny of Sydon and Lutheria, and he decided that he would use the Promethean Fire to change the world of Thylea for the better.": "数千年前，一个天使因为相信神性的秘密应该被赋予凡人种族而被从天堂驱逐出去。他的名字是Phaeros（CN太阳神）。在被流放之前，他设法偷走了普罗米修斯之火。他在各个位面漫游了几个世纪，最终来到了蒂莱亚的土地。在他的旅途中，他厌恶Sydon和Lutheria的暴政，决定利用普罗米修斯之火来改变蒂莱亚世界使之更美好。",
	"Phaeros sought out the greatest champion of each race and brought them to the City of the Sirens, the most beautiful city in Thylea. The sirens welcomed Phaeros, for they had fallen out of favor with the Titans and saw the angel as a messianic savior. Phaeros elevated each champion to godhood, creating a new pantheon. The sirens built great temples to each of the gods and sent missionaries out into the rest of Thylea to bring news of this new faith to the other races.": "费罗斯（Phaeros）寻找了每个种族中最伟大的冠军，并将他们带到了西莱亚最美丽的城市——塞壬之城。塞壬们欢迎费罗斯，因为他们已经失宠于泰坦，并将这位天使视为弥赛亚般的救世主。费罗斯将每位冠军提升为神格，创立了一个新的万神殿。塞壬们为每位神建造了宏伟的神庙，并派出传教士到西莱亚其他地区，将这一新信仰的消息传播给其他种族。",
	"But the Twin Titans saw this and called upon their father, Kentimane, to stop Phaeros. Sydon and Lutheria saw Phaeros as a foreign invader who intended to subvert everything that they had created.

This battle raged on for weeks, but finally, Phaeros was devoured by Scylla.": "但双子泰坦看到这一切，便呼唤他们的父亲，Kentimane(肯提曼尼)，来阻止Phaeros(费洛斯)。Sydon(赛登)和Lutheria(卢瑟里亚)将Phaeros视为一个意图颠覆他们所创造一切的外来入侵者。Kentimane释放了被囚禁在泰豹岛上的巨兽斯西拉(Scylla)。然后斯西拉和泰坦们对抗了新神祇。这场战斗持续了数周，最终，Phaeros被斯西拉吞噬。",
	"In the aftermath of the battle, Lutheria convinced the remaining gods to return to their temples, where she would offer them redemption—a chance to atone for the sins of Phaeros. This was a trick—Lutheria used her magic to trap the gods in their temples. Kentimane then rose out of the ocean and destroyed the foundations of the city, so that the oceans swallowed it.": "在战斗结束后，卢瑟莉亚（Lutheria）说服剩下的诸神返回他们的神殿，在那里她将给予他们救赎的机会——一个赎罪法罗斯（Phaeros）罪孽的机会。这其实是一个诡计——卢瑟莉亚利用她的魔法将诸神困在了他们的神殿里。肯提曼（Kentimane）随后从海洋中升起，摧毁了城市的基础，使海洋将其吞没。",

	"The empyreans are lying to the heroes—they are entirely self-interested. They have had their minds twisted by millennia of imprisonment.

	"Seeing what has happened to Thylea in her absence has infuriated Lutheria beyond measure. The mortals who defeated her are celebrated as the new Dragonlords, while she and her husband have been forgotten. Lutheria feels that this 'bold new world' is a joke.

	"Deep within the Sunken Kingdom, the lost pantheon of empyreans created by the angel, Phaeros, have waited for thousands of years for their chance to rule Thylea.

	"The Apokalypsis works best when the heroes have a lot invested in the fate of Thylea. This investment can be accomplished through game sessions with a focus on roleplaying. Alternatively, a game master can have the campaign skip forward by another year or two and describe how the world has changed and the heroes have prospered. If the heroes have new cities named after them, then those cities should have grown significantly.

	"If the heroes have recovered the Divine Artifacts, then they may already be on the path toward immortality.

For an outsider, it can be difficult to grasp the idea of being both the mortal enemy of \"savage centaurs\" and also a guest in a centaur camp. Worse yet, no one will explain that they will once again be fair game when they leave the camp on the next morning. This absolute standard of hospitality can be mistaken for weakness—a fatal error.

	"All Thylean natives understand the importance of oaths and the rules of civilized oath-taking. Because this is widely-understood (and therefore blindingly obvious), no one bothers to explain it. Outsiders may foolishly swear an oath, thinking that they are merely making a promise. In actuality, they are submitting to a solemn and binding vow. In this world, a hero's word means something—it has real weight. Outsiders who learn this lesson quickly will survive and thrive. Those who fail to do so will find themselves at the mercy of the Furies.": "所有西里亚人都明白誓言的重要性和文明誓言规则。因为这是众所周知的（因此显而易见），没有人会费心解释。外来者可能愚蠢地发誓，认为他们只是在做出承诺。实际上，他们正在接受一种庄严而具有约束力的誓约。在这个世界中，英雄的誓言意味着一些事情——它具有真正的分量。那些迅速学会这个教训的外来者将生存和茁壮成长。而那些未能如此做的人将发现自己处于复仇女神的怜悯之下。",
	"The gods of Thylea can also be unforgiving. Disrespecting or doubting divine power will provoke native superstition. Rightly so—for persistent doubt could well bring down the wrath of the gods. Openly practicing an outsider religion will also make natives uncomfortable. Denying the validity of Thylean religions will make their devotees fearful of divine anger. Being stupid enough to rob or desecrate a Thylean temple will infuriate both the gods and their native worshippers. Where the gods are concerned, caution is always preferred.": "在泰莱亚的神祇也可能是无情的。不尊重或怀疑神圣力量会激起当地的迷信。这样做是正确的—因为持续的怀疑可能会招致神祇的愤怒。公开信仰外来宗教也会让当地人感到不舒服。否认泰莱亚宗教的有效性会让信徒害怕神明的愤怒。足够愚蠢到去抢劫或亵渎泰莱亚神庙会激怒神祇和他们的本地信徒。在涉及神祇的事情上，谨慎总是更可取的。",
	"But provided that outsiders obey the rules of civilized behavior, mind their manners, and do not make rash statements or promises, they can make something of their lives in Thylea—and even thrive.": "但前提是外来者要遵守文明行为规则，注意自己的举止，不要轻率地发表言论或承诺，他们可以在锡莱亚（Thylea）过上有意义的生活，甚至茁壮成长。",

Originally of all races and nationalities, your people fought on the side of the natives in the First War. Thus, you are treated with distrust by the civilized races.": "你来自文明边缘的野蛮部落。这些部落由偶尔漂到泰莱亚海岸的外来者组成，在龙主们到来之前的几个世纪里逐渐形成。最初，你们的人民来自各种种族和国籍，在第一次战争中站在当地人一边作战。因此，你们被文明种族视为不信任的对象。",

	"You can have one of many origins: perhaps you are an outlaw who used to work with the thieves' guild in Mytros; perhaps you recently quit a bandit gang or pirate crew; you might be a spy for one of the kings; or perhaps you grew up on the streets and are a self-taught practitioner of the light-fingered arts.": "你可以选择多种背景：也许你是一个在米特洛斯（Mytros）的盗贼行会中工作过的逃犯；也许你最近刚退出了一个土匪团伙或海盗团队；你可能是某位国王的间谍；或者你在街头长大，是自学成才的偷窃艺术的从业者。",

	"Because of Thylea's lack of iron deposits, nearly all the native weapons and armor are forged from bronze, an alloy of copper and tin. In Thylea, bronze weapons are just as effective as their iron and steel counterparts. This is because the blacksmiths of Thylea have devised techniques to strengthen the bronze during the casting process. These techniques are closely-guarded secrets, which are passed down from master to apprentice. Legend holds that they were originally taught to the smiths of Estoria by the forge-god, Volkan.": "由于蒂莱亚（Thylea）缺乏铁矿床，几乎所有本地的武器和盔甲都是由青铜锻造而成，青铜是铜和锡的合金。在蒂莱亚，青铜武器和铁器、钢器一样有效。这是因为蒂莱亚的铁匠们已经研发出在铸造过程中强化青铜的技术。这些技术是被严密保守的秘密，由师傅传给学徒。传说称，这些技术最初是由锻造之神沃尔坎（Volkan）传授给埃斯托利亚（Estoria）的铁匠们的。",

Warriors who specialize with the chakram can learn to throw it in such a way that it returns to them after cutting the enemy.": "这个带刃的圆盘是一种不寻常的投掷武器。它在空中滑行，切割一切阻挡在它路径上的东西。那些专精于(`the chakram`)的战士可以学会以一种方式投掷它，使其在切割敌人后返回到他们身边。",

	"A gold egg must be kept hot, using the same methods as brass dragon eggs.": "黄金蛋必须保持温热，使用和黄铜龙蛋相同的方法。",
	"A typical dragon egg takes {@dice 3d6} days to hatch. When an egg is not looked after properly, there is a cumulative {@chance 10%} chance per day that the egg will die.

	"If a prospective Dragonlord wishes to bond with a dragon, they must be present at the hatching. When the newborn hatches, the Dragonlord must be the first living creature that it sees.

	"A metallic dragon is a magnificent creature that requires time, patience, respect, and care from its Dragonlord. For its first five years as a wyrmling, it benefits from having a parental figure, even if that parent isn't a dragon.

From this age onwards, a metallic dragon must decide whether it will remain with the person it has bonded.": "一只金属龙是一种需要其龙主花费时间、耐心、尊重和关怀的宏伟生物。在幼龙阶段的头五年，它受益于有一个父母般的形象，即使那个父母并非龙类。然而，一旦金属龙进入青年期，大约在5或6岁时，它的智力超过了除了最博学的学者和巫师之外的所有生物。从这个年龄开始，金属龙必须决定是否会继续留在它所结合的人身边。",
	"If a Dragonlord does not take proper care of her wyrmling, then the dragon may turn on her when it comes of age and flee into the wilderness. A young metallic dragon can easily survive in the wild, and its innate goodness means that it will still develop a sense of right and wrong. However, it might struggle to speak the Common language, and won't be as accustomed to interacting with humanoid races.": "如果一位龙领主没有妥善照顾她的幼龙，那么当幼龙长大后可能会背叛她，并逃入荒野。一条年轻的金属龙可以在野外轻松生存，它天生善良的本性意味着它仍会发展出一种是非观。然而，它可能会在说通用语言上遇到困难，并且不太习惯与人类种族互动。",
	"In order to strengthen the bond with her dragon, a Dragonlord must attune to her newborn dragon over the course of twelve long rests. These rests must be taken over the course of two weeks.

This allows them to communicate telepathically up to a range of 1 mile.": "为了加强与她的龙之间的联系，一位龙领主必须在十二次长休的过程中与她的新生龙建立共鸣。这些休息必须在两周的时间内进行。在共鸣期结束时，龙领主和龙之间形成了一种心灵感应的联系。这使他们能够在1英里的范围内进行心灵感应交流。",

	"To purposefully allow a dragon egg to die in order to use it in the creation of a magic item or in a ritual is a sin of the worst kind. It stains the soul, and no dragon will ever speak to or acknowledge the presence of anyone who has done such a thing. In some cases, a less civilized dragon may well attack an egg-murderer.": "故意让一枚龙蛋死去，以便用它来制作魔法物品或进行仪式，是一种最严重的罪行。它会玷污灵魂，任何龙都不会与或承认任何做过这种事的人存在。在某些情况下，一个不太文明的龙可能会攻击一个杀害龙蛋的人。",

Her limbs sunk to the bottom of the sea, stretching and twisting into great roots that connected each island, nurturing the fertile plants and gentle animals that sprang into being on the islands' surface.": "然而她的死并不是投降…而是一次光荣的牺牲。蒂莉亚的身体分裂开来；她的头和躯干漂浮到水面，变成了一串处女岛屿。她的心脏从胸腔中爆裂出来，变成了一棵巨大的树，从她所诞生的大陆中心拔地而起。她的四肢沉入海底，伸展扭曲成巨大的根系，连接着每个岛屿，滋养着生长在岛屿表面的肥沃植物和温和动物。",

	"Yet even after her death, a part of Thylea's spirit remained in the great Heart-Tree at the center of the islands. She reached out—silent as ever—and brushed against her mad husband's mind, soothing his tortured spirit with a soft caress. Sensing her presence, the hundred-handed giant transformed his grief into a new purpose. Binding himself to what was left of his lover with a solemn vow, Kentimane became the ward and protector of the islands, taking up an eternal vigil in the waters around their untouched shores.": "然而，即使在她去世之后，泰莉亚的一部分精神仍留在群岛中心的巨大心树中。她伸出手——像往常一样无声地——轻轻触碰她疯狂丈夫的心灵，用柔和的抚摸安抚他受折磨的灵魂。感知到她的存在，那位百手巨人将他的悲伤转化为一种新的目的。肯蒂曼（Kentimane）用庄严的誓言将自己与爱人所剩无几的部分绑定在一起，成为群岛的守护者和保护者，在未被触及的海岸周围永远保持警惕。",

	"In the beginning, the islands of Thylea were populated only by harmless plants and gentle animals—the flora and fauna a reflection of the nurturing spirit of the Mother Goddess that sacrificed herself to create them. A virgin paradise, the Forgotten Land was kept safe from the perils and evils of the outside world by the giant Kentimane of the Hundred Hands—Thylea's lover and protector. And together, the two were content.": "在开始的时候，泰莱亚（Thylea）群岛上只有无害的植物和温和的动物——植物和动物是母女神牺牲自己创造的，体现了她 nurturing 精神的反映。作为一个处女天堂，这片被遗忘的土地被百手巨人 Kentimane 保护着，远离外界世界的危险和邪恶——他是泰莱亚的爱人和守护者。两者一起，过着幸福的生活。",
	"But one day, the tree at the center of the islands—the transformed heart of the Mother Goddess herself—blossomed with seven strange fruits. Each the size of a boulder, they shimmered and pulsed with vibrant, shifting colors, almost as if alive. Seeing the tempting bounty sprouting from the branches, Kentimane reached from the ocean and plucked the fruit. His fifty heads gorged themselves on the succulent flesh, tearing and chewing until all that remained were seven spike-covered pits, which he tossed into the ocean.": "但有一天，位于群岛中心的那棵树——母女神自身转化的心脏——开出了七个奇怪的果实。每个果实都有一个巨石那么大，闪烁着生动而变幻的颜色，几乎像是活的一样。看到树枝上诱人的果实，肯提曼（Kentimane）伸手从海洋中摘下了果实。他的五十个头贪婪地吞食着多汁的果肉，撕咬着直到只剩下七个长满刺的果核，他将它们扔进了海洋。",
	"Instead of sinking, the pits floated on the waves, bobbing up and down. Offended by their taunting presence, Kentimane seized each pit in a clenched fist, squeezing so hard the spikes bit into his flesh and drew blood. Howling in rage, Kentimane slammed the pits down beneath the water, burying them deep beneath the muddy bottom of the ocean floor.": "在浪涛中，这些坑洞并没有下沉，而是漂浮着，上下起伏。肯蒂曼（Kentimane）感到被它们嘲讽的存在冒犯，他紧握拳头，抓住每一个坑洞，用力挤压，尖刺刺入他的肌肤，鲜血淋漓。肯蒂曼怒吼着，猛地将这些坑洞砸入水下，将它们深深埋藏在海底泥泞的深处。",
	"But the next morning the pits floated back up to the surface. Before Kentimane could seize them again, the pits burst open and the children of Thylea and Kentimane sprang forth into existence.": "但第二天早上，坑洞又浮到了表面。在肯蒂曼尼再次抓住它们之前，坑洞破裂开来，缔里亚和肯蒂曼尼的孩子们突然出现在世上。",
	"The hundred-handed god stared in wonder at his offspring: eight Titans born from the fruit of Thylea's tree, fertilized by the blood of Kentimane himself. Each of the first six pits had incubated a single child blessed with a different attribute drawn from one of their parents: Strength; Beauty; Wisdom; Craft; Prophecy and Swiftness. As these six Titans grew from children into adults, they became demi-gods, each representing the aspect of their parents they most embodied.": "百手神惊讶地凝视着他的后代：八位泰坦，诞生于泰莱亚之树的果实，以肯提曼的血液施肥。前六个坑孵化出了六个孩子，每个孩子都被赋予了不同的属性，这些属性来自他们的父母之一：力量；美丽；智慧；技艺；预言和敏捷。当这六位泰坦从孩童成长为成年人时，他们成为了半神，每个人代表着他们最具体现的父母的一面。",
	"However, from the seventh pit two Titans were born: Sydon and Lutheria, twin brother and sister. Sydon embodied his father's raging fury, and as he grew he became the God of Time and the Lord of Storms. His sister, Lutheria, inherited her mother's stillness and calm... but without Thylea's compassion or gentleness, she would eventually become the Goddess of Death and the Lady of Dreams.": "然而，在第七深渊中诞生了两位泰坦：赛登(Sydon)和卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria)，他们是孪生兄妹。赛登体现了他父亲的狂暴之怒，随着他的成长，他成为了时间之神和风暴之主。他的妹妹卢瑟莉亚继承了母亲的宁静与平静...但缺乏蒂莉亚(Thylea)的同情和温柔，最终她将成为死亡女神和梦境女士。",
	"But all this was far in the future, and Kentimane did not foresee what his offspring would one day become. He could not imagine the strife and suffering the Twins would bring to the peaceful islands. If he had known, he might have drowned them on the spot. But instead, he scooped up his children from the waves—including Sydon and Lutheria—and placed them gently at the base of the great Heart-Tree rising up from the center of the island, where Thylea could watch over them.": "但所有这一切都远在未来，肯蒂曼(Kentimane)并没有预见到他的后代有一天会变成什么样。他无法想象双子带给和平岛屿的冲突和痛苦。如果他知道的话，他可能会当场将他们淹死。但相反，他从海浪中将他的孩子们——包括西顿(Sydon)和卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria)——抱起，轻轻地放在从岛屿中心升起的巨大心树的基座上，让泰莉亚(Thylea)看守着他们。",
	"Having deposited the children in the warm bosom of their mother, Kentimane returned to the sea and resumed his eternal vigil, bound by his sacred vow to keep Thylea—and now also their children—safe from the outside world.": "将孩子们安置在母亲温暖的怀抱中后，肯蒂曼（Kentimane）回到了大海，继续他永恒的守护，受他守护泰莱亚（Thylea）—现在还有他们的孩子—免受外界世界的伤害的神圣誓约所束缚。",
	"For a time the eight children of Thylea and Kentimane lived quiet and contented lives, sheltered on the islands spawned from the body of their mother. But, in time, contentment became loneliness. They were gods, but they had no purpose.": "在蒂莉亚(Thylea)和肯提曼(Kentimane)的八个孩子在母体所生的岛屿上过着宁静而满足的生活。然而，随着时间的推移，满足变成了孤独。他们是神，但却没有目的。",
	"Talieus, the God of Crafting, first born of the siblings, gathered his younger brothers and sisters together and proposed they create races of mortal creatures to worship and revere them. Of all the Titans, only Sydon and Lutheria, his youngest siblings, refused: they were united by the powerful bond, and did not feel the empty loneliness of their kin.": "塔利厄斯(Talieus),工艺之神,众兄弟姐妹中的长子,召集他的年幼兄弟姐妹,提议创造出一些凡间生物种族来崇拜和敬仰他们。在所有泰坦中，只有赛登(Sydon)和卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria),他最年幼的兄弟姐妹，拒绝了：他们被强大的羁绊所团结，不感受到兄弟姐妹们的空虚孤独。",
	"The other Titans created centaurs, satyrs and nymphs, who quickly spread to populate the islands. Next, they created the cyclopes and gygans, great giants capable of moving earth and stone to build massive temples in honor of Talieus and the others who had given them life.": "其他泰坦（Titans）创造了半人马、萨提尔（satyrs）和仙女（nymphs），它们迅速传播到各个岛屿上。接着，它们创造了独眼巨人（cyclopes）和吉安斯（gygans），这些巨人能够移动土地和石头，建造庞大的神庙，以纪念塔利厄斯（Talieus）和其他赋予它们生命的泰坦。",
	"Sydon and Lutheria regarded these new mortal races with contempt. They became bitter and resentful, and isolated themselves on the last uninhabited island of Thylea, where their hatred festered.": "赛登(Sydon)和卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria)鄙视这些新的凡人种族。他们变得愤怒和怨恨，并将自己孤立在蒂莱亚(Thylea)最后一个无人居住的岛屿上，他们的仇恨在那里滋生。",
	"One day, Lutheria approached Talieus, claiming she and her twin had grown weary of their solitude. Offering praise and flattery, she urged him to create a new race, one greater than all the others, to dwell on her island.": "有一天，卢瑟莉亚（Lutheria）走向泰利厄斯（Talieus），声称她和她的孪生已经厌倦了他们的孤独。她称赞和阿谀，敦促他创造一个新的种族，比其他所有种族都更伟大，在她的岛上居住。",
	"Weakened by his sister's adulation, Talieus did as he was bade and the myrmekes were born. An industrious, insect-like race with a shared hive-mind intelligence, the myrmekes quickly spread out from their isolated home, overwhelming and conquering the native species on nearby islands.": "在他妹妹的崇拜下变得软弱，泰利厄斯按照指示行事，蚁人(myrmekes)诞生了。蚁人是一种勤劳的、类似昆虫的种族，拥有共享的蚁穴智慧，它们迅速从孤立的家园扩散开来，压倒并征服了附近岛屿上的本地物种。",
	"The other Titans condemned Talieus for creating such aggressive and dangerous creatures. Talieus, burning with parental pride, refused act against his newest children. It fell to Sydon, the God of Storms, to halt the myrmekes' advance. As they piled into their ships, he unleashed the fury of the sea, dashing their vessels to smithereens with howling winds, drowning them beneath the waves. Even Sydon could not halt their advance forever. The other Titans, fearful the myrmekes would continue to spread, begged their father for help. Moved by the fears of his children, Kentimane used his hundred hands to gather all the myrmekes onto a single island. Calling on the strength of Thylea herself, he bound them there with powerful magic so they could never leave.": "其他泰坦谴责塔利厄斯创造了如此具侵略性和危险性的生物。塔利厄斯因为父母的骄傲而燃烧，拒绝对他最新的孩子采取行动。萨顿，风暴之神，被迫阻止蚁兵们的前进。当他们涌入船只时，他释放了海洋的愤怒，用呼啸的风将他们的船只摧毁，将他们淹没在海浪之下。即使萨顿也无法永远阻止他们的前进。其他泰坦担心蚁兵会继续蔓延，恳求他们的父亲帮助。被孩子们的恐惧所感动，肯提曼尼用他的百只手将所有蚁兵聚集到一个岛上。他借助泰莉亚本身的力量，用强大的魔法将它们困在那里，使它们永远无法离开。",
	"As punishment for his foolishness and pride, Kentimane stripped Talieus of his power and gave it to Sydon. Using his older brother's former power against him, Sydon bound Talieus and presented him to his sister and now wife as a gift.": "作为对他愚蠢和骄傲的惩罚，Kentimane剥夺了Talieus的权力，并将其赋予了Sydon。Sydon利用他哥哥以前的权力束缚了Talieus，并将他作为礼物呈现给了他的妹妹，现在的妻子。",
	"Lutheria took no pity on her helpless elder brother. She blinded the mighty Titan and sewed his lips shut, so he could never tell the others the truth of his downfall. Then she bound his power to her crystal scythe and forced him to wander eternally in the Nether Sea, dragging her throne-ship across the waves behind him by a great chain strapped around his neck.": "卢瑟利亚（Lutheria）对她毫无抵抗能力的哥哥毫不留情。她致盲了这位强大的泰坦，并缝合了他的嘴唇，这样他永远无法告诉其他人他失败的真相。然后，她将他的力量绑定在她的水晶镰刀上，迫使他永远在幽冥之海中徘徊，通过绑在他脖子上的一根巨大链条拖着她的王座船穿过波涛。",
	"Seeing Talieus' fate, the other Titans were horrified. Together they began plotting revenge against the twins, but Lutheria and Sydon were ready for them.": "看到塔利厄斯(Talieus)的命运，其他泰坦(Titans)感到恐惧。他们一起开始密谋报复这对双胞胎，但卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria)和赛登(Sydon)早已有所准备。",
	"For a time the children of Thylea and Kentimane dwelt together in peace. But after Lutheria and Sydon enslaved their eldest brother for creating the myrmekes, the remaining siblings decided upon revenge.": "有一段时间，锡莱亚（Thylea）和肯提曼（Kentimane）的孩子们和睦相处。但在卢瑟莉亚（Lutheria）和赛登（Sydon）奴役了他们的大哥，因为他创造了蚁人之后，剩下的兄弟姐妹决定寻求报复。",
	"Hergeron, the second eldest brother and the god of Strength and Valor, challenged Sydon to a duel, brashly confident in his own abilities. But Sydon had absorbed much of the enslaved Talieus' power, and he easily bested his challenger. Sydon imprisoned the defeated Hergeron beneath a great tower, chaining him to so that the full weight of the building was forever pressing down on Hergeron's enormous neck and shoulders.": "赫格隆(Hergeron)，第二个兄弟，也是力量和勇气之神，挑战赛顿(Sydon)进行决斗，自信满满地相信自己的能力。但赛顿吸收了被奴役的泰利乌斯(Talieus)的力量，轻松地打败了挑战者。赛顿将被打败的赫格隆囚禁在一座巨大塔楼下，将他锁链在那里，让整座建筑的重量永远压在赫格隆巨大的脖子和肩膀上。",
	"The remaining four siblings, realizing Sydon had grown too powerful to challenge directly, decided to strike at Lutheria. In secret, they traveled to her island but the Goddess of Death had set a trap for her kin. Through the ritual sacrifice of a thousand basilisks, she had created a great pool of poisonous blood at the heart of her domain. When the invaders set foot upon the island they triggered wards of power that released the magic of the foul pool in a lethal burst, instantly turning three of them to stone. Only Chalcia, the Goddess of Swiftness, was nimble enough to escape.": "剩下的四个兄弟姐妹意识到Sydon已经变得太强大，无法直接挑战，于是决定袭击Lutheria。秘密地，他们前往她的岛屿，但死亡女神为她的亲人设下了陷阱。通过祭祀一千只蜥蜴兽，她在领地中心创造了一大池毒血。当入侵者踏上岛屿时，触发了释放邪恶池魔法的强大结界，瞬间将其中三人化为石像。唯有Chalcia（快速女神）足够灵巧，成功逃脱。",
	"Knowing the Twins would come after her, Chalcia took shelter beneath a massive volcano. There she could use her speed and quickness to survive in the labyrinth of tunnels and lava tubes. When Sydon learned of the failed attack against his sister-wife, his fury knew no bounds. In a blind rage, he summoned a great storm to lash all the islands of Thylea, seeking to flood the chambers where Chalcia was hiding.": "知道双子会追来，查尔西娅躲在一座巨大火山下。在那里，她可以利用自己的速度和敏捷在迷宫般的隧道和熔岩管中生存。当赛登得知对他的姐妹妻子的失败袭击时，他的愤怒无法抑制。在盲目的愤怒中，他召唤了一场巨大的风暴袭击了蒂莱亚的所有岛屿，试图淹没查尔西娅藏身之处的洞穴。",
	"The storms threatened to wash away Thylea itself, something that Kentimane would not allow. Kentimane had stayed neutral in the battles of his children but, once the safety of all of Thylea became threatened, he was forced to intervene. Kentimane blunted the storms, and he forbade Sydon and Lutheria from destroying the volcano that sheltered their fugitive sister. Sydon was loathe to let Chalcia escape retribution, but even he was not strong enough to defy his mighty father. Lutheria, cunning as ever, knew of another way to get revenge.": "风暴威胁着洗刷掉泰莱亚本身，这是肯提曼（Kentimane）所不能容忍的。肯提曼在他的子女之间的战斗中保持中立，但一旦整个泰莱亚的安全受到威胁，他被迫介入。肯提曼削弱了风暴，并禁止赛登（Sydon）和卢瑟莉亚（Lutheria）摧毁庇护他们逃亡姐妹的火山。赛登不愿让查尔西亚（Chalcia）逃脱惩罚，但即使他也没有足够的力量来违抗他强大的父亲。卢瑟莉亚，一如既往地狡诈，知道另一种报复的方法。",
	"Uniting their power, and the power stolen from their fallen siblings, the Twins reached deep into the foundation of Thylea. They shifted rock and stone, careful not to disturb the islands above as they sealed off the tunnels and chambers beneath the volcano one by one.": "双子们汇聚他们的力量，以及从他们倒下的同胞那里窃取的力量，深入到泰利亚的基础之中。他们移动岩石和石头，小心翼翼地不打扰上方的岛屿，逐一封闭了火山下方的隧道和房间。",
	"Chalcia ran from their relentless work, driven ever deeper beneath the earth. In the end, the elusive Goddess of Swiftness found herself trapped in a tiny chamber at the very heart of the volcano itself. With every exit sealed, the walls slowly closed in tighter and tighter as burning lava oozed through cracks and crevices in floor and ceiling. Instead of crushing her, the Twins stopped at the last instant, entombing their sister for all eternity in a crypt of searing heat and noxious fumes.": "查尔西亚(Chalcia) 逃离了她们不懈的工作，被驱使着越来越深入地下。最终，这位难以捉摸的迅捷女神发现自己被困在火山本身的核心的一个小房间里。随着每一个出口被封闭，墙壁慢慢地越来越紧，燃烧的岩浆从地板和天花板的裂缝中渗出。然而，双生子在最后一刻停了下来，将她们的姐妹永远地埋葬在灼热和有毒烟雾的地下坟墓中，而不是将她压碎。",
	"Their siblings gone, Sydon and Lutheria ruled supreme over the lands of Thylea, worshipped and honored by the gygans, centaurs, nymphs and other fey. Ages passed, and the dead Titans were forgotten by the children they had created. As far as history remembered, the Twin Titans were the authors of all.": "他们的兄弟姐妹已经离去，西顿(Sydon)和卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria)统治着蒂莱亚(Thylea)的土地，受到巨人、半人马、仙女和其他精灵的崇拜和尊敬。岁月流逝，死去的泰坦被他们所创造的后代遗忘。就历史而言，双子泰坦是一切的创造者。",
	"But the remote continent birthed from their mother could not remain hidden forever. As the centuries passed, the so-called civilized races, humans, elves, dwarves and their like, began to stumble across the islands at the far reaches of the Forgotten Sea. The first to arrive were refugees and castaways, survivors of ships gone astray. Half-drowned, they crawled onto island shores and carved out a meager existence among the native fey races.": "但是源自他们母亲的遥远大陆终究无法永远隐藏。随着世纪的流逝，所谓的文明种族，人类，精灵，矮人等等，开始偶然发现了遗忘之海边缘的岛屿。首批抵达的是难民和遇难者，是那些船只误入歧途的幸存者。半淹没的他们爬上岛屿海岸，与当地的精灵种族一起艰难地谋生。",
	"Sydon ignored these newcomers. They were too weak and pathetic to acknowledge. Lutheria found something compelling in their nature. When others came, the explorers and settlers, she stayed Sydon's fury and allowed them to land safely so she could study these strange folk. As their numbers grew, the civilized races established small villages along the coasts. Bit by bit, they spread across the islands of Thylea, until their numbers brought them into conflict with the original inhabitants.": "赛登（Sydon）无视了这些新来者。他们太弱了，太可怜了，不值得承认。露瑟莉亚（Lutheria）在他们的本质中发现了一些引人注目的东西。当其他人到来时，探险者和定居者，她制止了赛登的愤怒，并让他们安全着陆，以便研究这些奇怪的人。随着他们的人数增长，文明种族在沿海建立了小村庄。他们逐渐地遍布了锡莱亚（Thylea）群岛，直到他们的人数与原住民发生冲突。",
	"At first, the civilized races suffered losses whenever they encountered the fey folk. They had neither the strength nor numbers to challenge the gygans or centaurs in battle. They lacked the power to resist the magic tricks and temptations of the nymphs, dryads and satyrs. Everything changed with the arrival of the Dragonlords, a band of heroes who fought astride great winged mounts.": "起初，当文明种族遭遇精灵时，他们总是遭受损失。他们既没有足够的力量和人数来挑战巨人族或半人马族的战斗，也缺乏抵抗仙女、树精和半人半兽的魔法诡计和诱惑的力量。一切都随着龙领主的到来而改变，这是一群英雄，骑在巨大有翅膀的坐骑上进行战斗。",
	"Their leader was Xander Huorath, with his mighty silver dragon, Balmytria. The second in command, Xander's chief rival, was Rizon Phobas, who rode Balmytria's mate, a great bronze dragon. Joining them were Adonis Neurdagon, beautiful and vain; the brothers Telamok and Estor Arkelandor, ruthless and savage warriors; and several others who have since been forgotten. Each warrior was oathsworn to a dragon, and together, they were nigh unstoppable in battle.": "他们的领袖是赞德·赫拉斯(Xander Huorath)，他骑着他那只强大的银龙，巴尔米特里亚(Balmytria)。第二把手是赞德的主要对手，里松·福巴斯(Rizon Phobas)，他骑着巴尔米特里亚的伴侣，一只伟大的青铜龙。加入他们的还有阿多尼斯·纽尔达冈(Adonis Neurdagon)，美丽而虚荣；兄弟泰拉莫克(Telamok)和埃斯托尔·阿克兰多尔(Estor Arkelandor)，残忍而凶猛的战士；以及其他一些如今已经被遗忘的人。每位战士都向一只龙宣誓效忠，他们联手在战斗中几乎无法被阻挡。",
	"The arrival of these magnificent creatures stoked Lutheria's fascination with the newcomers. The dragons were unlike anything found in Thylea. At his sister's urging, Sydon ignored the pleading of his worshippers to cleanse Thylea of the invaders. Under the leadership of the Dragonlords, the civilized races entered an age of unprecedented expansion.": "这些壮丽生物的到来激起了卢瑟利亚对这些新来者的兴趣。这些龙与泰莱亚所见的任何生物都不同。在他姐姐的劝说下，西顿无视了他的信徒们恳求他清除入侵者的请求。在龙主的领导下，文明种族进入了一个前所未有的扩张时代。",
	"Villages became towns, and towns grew into great walled cities. Encounters between the newcomers and the native races became more frequent, and more violent. Now the newcomers were winning. The native races were pushed back, retreating into the unexplored wilds. Still, out of respect for his sister-wife's curiosity, Sydon held his fury in check, just waiting an inevitable spark that would ignite the fires of all-out war.": "村庄变成了城镇，城镇发展成了雄伟的有城墙的城市。新来者和土著种族之间的冲突变得更加频繁，也更加激烈。如今，新来者开始占据上风。土著种族被逼退，撤入未被探索的荒野之中。然而，出于对他的姐妹妻子好奇心的尊重，Sydon 控制住了自己的愤怒，只是在等待着一次不可避免的火花，点燃全面战争的烈焰。",
	"He did not have to wait long.": "他没有等待很长时间。",
	"Of all the Dragonlords, the brothers Telamok and Estor Arkelander were the most ruthless and savage. Telamok, the elder, dreamed of being a great king. He offered his protection, and that of his dragon, to any who would swear allegiance to him. He promised a future in which the so-called civilized species had utter dominance over Thylea and the fey creatures.": "在所有的龙领主中，兄弟泰拉莫克（Telamok）和埃斯托尔·阿克兰德（Estor Arkelander）是最残忍和野蛮的。泰拉莫克，年长者，梦想成为一位伟大的国王。他向任何愿意效忠于他的人提供保护，以及他和他的龙的保护。他承诺未来将让所谓的文明物种完全统治泰莱亚和仙族生物。",
	"Mortals of all races flocked to his banner. He built fortresses and walled cities to protect his followers from attack, the foundation of what would one day become the great kingdom of Mytros. The ranks of his armies, under the command of his younger brother Estor, swelled.": "各种种族的凡人蜂拥而至，投靠他的旗帜。他建造了堡垒和有城墙的城市，保护他的追随者免受攻击，这奠定了有朝一日将成为伟大王国Mytros的基础。他的军队阵容，在他的弟弟Estor的指挥下，不断壮大。",
	"For Telamok, war was merely a tool, a way to build and secure the future of his people. Estor, however, cared little for the future. He had no desire to rule or govern, and his only joy was battle. Most, including his dragon, thought he was a brave hero, seeking glory. The truth was far worse, for war was the only way that Estor could satisfy his bloodlust and cruelty. His victories on the battlefield meant nothing beyond the chance of slaughter and carnage.": "对于泰拉莫克（Telamok）来说，战争只是一种工具，一种建立和保护他的人民未来的方式。然而，埃斯托尔（Estor）对未来并不在意。他没有统治或治理的欲望，他唯一的快乐就是战斗。大多数人，包括他的龙，都认为他是一个勇敢的英雄，追求荣耀。事实要糟糕得多，因为战争是埃斯托尔满足他的嗜血和残忍的唯一途径。他在战场上的胜利除了屠杀和混乱的机会外毫无意义。",
	"As Telamok's kingdom grew, it expanded into gygan territory. Knowing the one-eyed, six-armed giants would not welcome outsiders, he commanded Estor to lead his army against them. In Telamok's mind, his brother would break the gygan ranks and force the giants to bend the knee. Estor, however, had other plans.": "随着泰拉莫克(Telamok)王国的壮大，它扩张到了吉甘(Gygan)领土。知道这些一只眼睛、六只手臂的巨人不会欢迎外来者，他命令埃斯托(Estor)率领他的军队对抗他们。在泰拉莫克的心中，他的兄弟会打破吉甘的阵线，迫使巨人屈服。然而，埃斯托却有其他打算。",
	"Riding on his dragon, he led the charge that routed the gygans. The giants fought bravely, but were no match for the Dragonlord and his mount. Once they knew the battle was lost, they threw down their weapons in surrender. Estor refused to take prisoners, and refused to parley. To the horror of his noble dragon mount, he ordered his troops to massacre every single gygan warrior.": "骑在他的龙上，他率领冲锋，击溃了巨人们。这些巨人勇敢地战斗，但他们根本不是龙领主及其坐骑的对手。一旦他们知道战斗已经失败，他们投降时投下了武器。埃斯托尔（Estor）拒绝俘虏，也拒绝和谈。在他高贵的龙坐骑震惊的目光下，他命令部队屠杀每一个巨人战士。",
	"The gygan threat was gone, but Estor was not finished. He pushed his soldiers onwards to the towns where the gygans lived. Their warriors slain, the remainder were now defenseless. Estor's dragon begged him to show mercy, but he was deaf to her pleas. His army massacred mothers and children, the old and the infirm. Only a handful of gygans escaped to warn the other fey folk of Estor's atrocities.": "吉甘（Gygan）的威胁消失了，但埃斯托尔（Estor）并未停止。他驱使士兵前进到吉甘居住的城镇。他们的战士被杀，剩下的人此刻毫无防御之力。埃斯托尔的龙请求他显示仁慈，但他对她的请求充耳不闻。他的军队屠杀了母亲和孩子，老人和病弱者。只有少数吉甘人逃脱，去警告其他精灵族人埃斯托尔的暴行。",
	"The unbridled slaughter revealed Estor's true nature and his dragon abandoned him. The consequences of his actions went much further. Seeing the slaughter, Lutheria finally recognized the threat the newcomers posed, and she released Sydon from his vow to not harm them. With his fury finally unleashed, Sydon gathered a great army of fey creatures and led them against the civilized races that had butchered the gygans. Sydon meant to drive the invaders into the sea.": "无法无天的屠杀揭示了埃斯托尔（Estor）的真实本性，他的龙也抛弃了他。他的行为带来的后果更为严重。路瑟利亚（Lutheria）看到这场屠杀，终于意识到新来者所构成的威胁，她解除了西顿（Sydon）不伤害他们的誓言。在他的愤怒终于被释放后，西顿聚集了一支庞大的仙族军队，并带领他们对抗那些屠杀巨人的文明种族。西顿打算将入侵者赶入大海。",
	"The First War had begun.": "第一次战争已经开始。",
	"The atrocities of Estor Arkelander drove his dragon to abandon him. But even without his mount, Estor continued his murderous campaign against the native creatures as the captain of the Ultros, a magical ship with a crew nearly as savage and bloodthirsty as Estor himself. The crew of the {@italic Ultros} ravaged the islands of Thylea, leaving slaughter in their wake. Sydon threw everything against the vessel, trying to smash it with hundred-foot waves or drag it down to the bottom of the sea. The magic of the {@italic Ultros} was so powerful even the God of Storms couldn't sink it.": "埃斯托·阿克兰德（Estor Arkelander）的暴行导致他的龙抛弃了他。但即使没有坐骑，埃斯托作为乌尔特洛斯（Ultros）的船长，继续对当地生物发动杀戮。乌尔特洛斯号的船员几乎和埃斯托本人一样野蛮和嗜血。{@italic Ultros} 的船员肆虐了蒂莱亚（Thylea）的岛屿，留下屠杀的痕迹。西顿（Sydon）竭尽全力对抗这艘船，试图用百尺巨浪摧毁它，或将其拖入海底。即使是风暴之神也无法让这艘船沉没，{@italic Ultros} 的魔法如此强大。",
	"With Sydon's failure, it fell to Lutheria to find a way to end Estor's reign of terror. She approached the barbaric Captain in a dream: if Estor swore to end his massacres against her children, she would give him and his crew eternal life by ritual magic. Estor was naturally wary of a trap, particularly when approached by a naked goddess in his dreams, but he knew that he was safe on the Ultros. Even the Goddess of Death could not harm him. Seduced by the Goddess, he woke from his dream and slit the throats of his officers as a blood sacrifice to begin her immortality ritual.": "随着Sydon的失败，结束Estor的暴政责任落到了Lutheria身上。她在梦中接近了野蛮的船长：如果Estor发誓停止对她的子民的屠杀，她将通过仪式魔法赐予他和他的船员永生。Estor自然对陷阱心存戒备，尤其是在梦中被一位赤裸女神接近时，但他知道自己在Ultros号上是安全的。即使是死亡女神也不能伤害他。被女神诱惑，他从梦中醒来，割断了他的军官们的喉咙，作为开始她的不朽仪式的血祭。",
	"Lutheria came to him on a cold wind, swooping in from void of a moonless night to land on the deck of the Ultros. The Captain, as Estor now styled himself, was enchanted by her cold, cruel beauty and lay with the Goddess to consummate the arrangement. The two were surrounded by the leering corpses of his butchered men.": "卢瑟莉娅（Lutheria）随着寒风来到他身边，从一夜无月的虚空中飞扑到乌尔特洛斯（Ultros）的甲板上。船长，如今自称为艾斯托尔（Estor），被她冷酷的美丽所迷惑，与女神交合以达成协议。两人被他屠杀的手下的尸体所围绕。",
	"As the first rays of sun climbed over the horizon, Lutheria vanished. The officers that Estor had murdered rose to their feet. Though all knew how Estor had betrayed them, Lutheria's ritual bound them to his will. When they saluted their Captain, Estor let out a great, roaring laugh. He knew he had been blessed by Lutheria and would never die.": "当第一缕阳光爬过地平线时，卢瑟利亚消失了。艾斯托尔谋杀的军官们站了起来。尽管所有人都知道艾斯托尔如何背叛了他们，但卢瑟利亚的仪式将他们束缚在他的意志之下。当他们向他们的队长致敬时，艾斯托尔发出了一声巨大而震耳欲聋的笑声。他知道自己已经被卢瑟利亚祝福，永远不会死去。",
	"The blessing of the Goddess of Death soon revealed its nature as a curse. Estor and his crew could not die, but they still felt pain: wounds would not kill them, but neither would they heal. Instead, they festered and rotted. Age could not touch them, but they felt the ravages of disease and illness. Lutheria was true to her word: as the years turned to decades and then centuries, they did not die. They endured as twisted and disfigured creatures, trapped in a world between life and death as they were slowly driven mad.": "死亡女神的祝福很快显露出其本质，成为了一种诅咒。艾斯托尔（Estor）和他的船员无法死去，但他们仍然感受到痛苦：伤口无法致命，但也无法愈合。相反，它们变得腐烂发炎。时间无法触及他们，但他们感受到了疾病和疾病的摧残。卢瑟莉亚（Lutheria）言而有信：随着岁月流逝成为几十年，然后是世纪，他们并没有死去。他们作为扭曲和畸形的生物继续存在，被困在生与死之间的世界中，慢慢地被逐渐逼疯。",
	"After centuries of torment, Estor and his crew tried to break Lutheria's curse with a second ritual. They sought the release of death, but the Mistress of Death would not grant them peace. Their bodies decomposed and fell away, but their spirits were bound to the Ultros, now a ship manned by ghosts and doomed to forever sail the seas of Thylea.": "经过几个世纪的折磨，艾斯托尔(Estor)和他的船员试图用第二个仪式来打破卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria)的诅咒。他们寻求死亡的解脱，但死亡女神不会给予他们平静。他们的身体腐烂并消逝，但他们的灵魂被绑定在乌尔特罗斯(Ultros)上，这艘船现在由幽灵驾驶，注定永远在泰利亚(Thylea)的海域航行。",
	"Some say that it was the Dragonlords who summoned the Five Gods. Others say that it was the silver dragon, Balmytria. So much time has passed now; the truth may never be known.": "有人说是龙领主们召唤了五位神祇。也有人说是银龙巴尔米特利亚。现在已经过去了这么长时间，或许真相永远无法得知。",
	"At the beginning of the First War the civilized peoples won many victories. Led by the Dragonlords, they rode roughshod over the armies of the Titans. The children of Thylea could not stand against the great dragons and were routed time and time again.": "在第一次战争开始时，文明人民赢得了许多胜利。在龙领主的带领下，他们蹂躏了泰坦的军队。泰莱亚的子民无法抵抗伟大的龙，一次又一次地被击溃。",
	"The armies of gygans and centaurs prayed to Sydon and Lutheria for aid, crying out to the Twins to save them from extinction. They begged the Titans to destroy the dragons, so that they could meet the civilized races in equal strength on the battlefield.": "巨人和半人马的军队祈求赛登(Sydon)和卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria)的援助，哀求双子(Twins)拯救他们免于灭绝。他们恳求泰坦(Titans)摧毁龙族，这样他们就能在战场上与文明种族同等强大地对抗。",
	"Sydon and Lutheria heard their laments and joined the struggle. The tide of war turned in favor of the native races: even a dragon cannot stand against a Titan. Whenever the dragons took to the skies, Sydon lashed them with raging winds and blasts of lightning, forcing them to the ground, where they became vulnerable to the wrath of Lutheria, who assailed them with her wicked scythe and death magic.": "赛登(Sydon)和露瑟莉亚(Lutheria)听到了他们的哀叹声，加入了战斗。战争的潮流开始向本地种族倾斜：即使是一条龙也无法抵抗泰坦(Titan)。每当龙飞上天空，赛登用狂暴的风和闪电抽打它们，迫使它们落到地面，变得容易受到露瑟莉亚的愤怒袭击，她用邪恶的镰刀和死亡魔法攻击它们。",
	"Many dragons were lost, and others fled. But the silver dragon, Balmytria, knew that Lutheria and Sydon would eventually find them all. In her final stand against the tyranny of the Titans, the silver dragon threw herself heedlessly against them, tearing and clawing, even after suffering numerous mortal injuries. When at last her energy was exhausted, she collapsed to the ground dead, and the Twins spat on her corpse.": "许多龙失踪了，其他的逃走了。但白银龙巴尔米特利亚（Balmytria）知道卢瑟利亚（Lutheria）和赛登（Sydon）最终会找到它们所有的。在对抗泰坦的暴政的最后一战中，白银龙毫不顾忌地冲向他们，撕咬，抓挠，即使遭受了许多致命的伤势。当她最终耗尽能量时，她倒在地上，气绝身亡，双胞胎（the Twins）对她的尸体吐了口水。",
	"Balmytria's death ripped a hole in the very fabric of reality that rippled throughout the multiverse. Inspired by her sacrifice, five celestial beings answered her prayer and came to Thylea to protect her people. These beings are known as the Five Gods, who we still worship today: Mytros, Volkan, Pylor, Vallus and Kyrah.": "巴尔米特利亚（Balmytria）的死亡在现实的织物中撕开了一个裂缝，这个裂缝在多元宇宙中蔓延开来。受到她牺牲的启发，五位天界存在回应了她的祈祷，来到赛莱亚（Thylea）保护她的人民。这些存在被称为五位神祗，我们至今仍在崇拜：迈特洛斯（Mytros）、沃尔坎（Volkan）、派洛（Pylor）、瓦卢斯（Vallus）和凯拉（Kyrah）。",
	"The Five pledged themselves to protect the civilized races, restoring the balance of power. In the years that followed, an uneasy truce was brokered, creating a peace that has lasted for 500 years.": "五位誓言保护文明种族，恢复力量平衡。在接下来的几年里，一场脆弱的休战被斡旋出来，创造了持续了500年的和平。",
	"They say that truth is often stranger than fiction, and history is often not quite what it seems. The silver dragon, Balmytria, was indeed responsible for the summoning of the Five Gods, but she did not beckon them down from the heavens. They were not some foreign, celestial saviors.": "他们说事实往往比虚构更离奇，历史往往并非看起来那样。这条银龙，(Balmytria)，确实是召唤五位神祇的责任者，但她并没有将他们从天堂召唤下来。他们并不是某些外来的天界救世主。",
	"Balmytria saw that unless the Titans were stopped, they would destroy all of Thylea. She vowed action.": "巴尔米特里娅（Balmytria）看到，如果泰坦（Titans）不被阻止，他们将摧毁整个锡利亚（Thylea）。她发誓要采取行动。",
	"Knowing that Sydon and Lutheria were proud creatures, Balmytria challenged the Twins to the game of twenty squares, which is also called the Royal Game. She summoned them to the island of the Golden Heart, which is the home of the Mother Goddess herself. They would play beneath the great tree, with the mother of the Titans as their sacred witness.": "知道赛登(Sydon)和卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria)是骄傲的生物，巴尔米特里亚(Balmytria)向双子挑战了二十方格游戏，也被称为皇家游戏。她召唤他们前往黄金之心岛，这是女神之母的家园。他们将在巨树下玩耍，泰坦之母将作为他们的神圣见证人。",
	"The stakes would be simple: she would wager her life and the lives of all her kind against the divine power of the Titans. In this way, the war could be ended.": "赌注很简单：她将押上她的生命和所有同类的生命，对抗泰坦神力。这样，战争就可以结束了。",
	"Lutheria saw the trap right away, but her husband would not listen. Sydon had never been defeated at the Royal Game in all his centuries. He accepted Balmytria's terms, and the game began.": "路瑟利亚(Lutheria)立刻看出了陷阱，但她的丈夫不肯听她的劝告。西顿(Sydon)在他的几个世纪中从未在皇家游戏中被打败过。他接受了巴尔米特利亚(Balmytria)的条件，游戏开始了。",
	"When gods play the game of twenty squares, the pieces symbolize entire armies, and the fall of the dice are like the hammers of Fate, drenching the earth with the blood of those armies. Thousands of soldiers may live and die by the turn of a single gambit.": "当众神玩弈二十方棋时，棋子象征着整个军队，骰子的落下如同命运之锤，用那些军队的鲜血浸透大地。成千上万的士兵可能因为一次赌局的转折而生死。",
	"Balmytria knew that Sydon had never lost at the Royal Game. Accordingly, she chose her moves with extreme care, taking the full time allotted—one rotation of the stars per turn. And all the while, she was maddeningly silent. Sydon shouted at her, demanding that she look him in the eyes, rise to his taunts, or just say anything at all. He quickly lost patience with the game, rolling the dice as soon as his turns began, simply to have it over with. His impatience proved his undoing.": "巴尔米特里亚知道赛顿从未在皇家游戏中输过。因此，她非常谨慎地选择着自己的走法，耗尽了所有分配的时间——每回合一个星星的旋转。而她却一言不发，令人发狂。赛顿对她大声喊叫，要求她看着他的眼睛，对他的嘲讽作出回应，或者只是说点什么。他很快对游戏失去耐心，一旦轮到他的回合就立即掷骰子，只是为了结束游戏。他的不耐烦最终导致了他的失败。",
	"Balmytria won the first game, shattering the Titan's winning record and his pride. He raised his fists to the sky and mountains crumbled, so angry was he. But before his sister-wife could calm him, he had doubled the stakes and challenged the silver dragon to a rematch.": "巴尔米特里亚(Balmytria)赢得了第一场比赛，打破了泰坦(Titan)的连胜纪录，也打破了他的自尊。他举起双拳冲天而起，山峦纷纷崩塌，他愤怒异常。但在他的姐妹妻子能够安抚他之前，他已经加倍下注，挑战了白银龙(Silver Dragon)进行复赛。",
	"This continued for five more games. Balmytria remained patient, neither speaking nor eating even as a full month passed. Meanwhile, Sydon spiralled into a wrath such as the world had never seen.": "这种情况持续了另外五场比赛。巴尔米特利亚一直保持耐心，即使一个月过去了也既不说话也不进食。与此同时，西顿陷入了世界从未见过的愤怒之中。",
	"Lutheria clawed at her own face, furious with her husband's idiocy. She could not interfere with the game directly, for the magic that enforces the game of twenty squares is woven deep into the fabric of the multiverse.": "卢瑟莉亚（Lutheria）愤怒地抓着自己的脸，对丈夫的愚蠢感到愤怒。她无法直接干预游戏，因为强制执行二十方格游戏的魔法深深地编织在多元宇宙的结构中。",
	"But she knew that the seventh game was sacred. \"Seventh game takes all,\" they say. If Sydon could win the seventh game, then the six previous matches would mean nothing. The Titans would have their way.": "但她知道第七场比赛是神圣的。人们说，“第七场比赛决定一切”。如果(Sydon)能赢得第七场比赛，那么前六场比赛就毫无意义了。泰坦将会如愿以偿。",
	"As her husband lost game after game, Lutheria sat quietly, weaving magic into the dice. Even the greatest spells in Thylea seemed to have no effect. Desperate, she began to pour her divine power into the dice. As the magical energy took hold of the dice, she felt herself growing weaker—and Sydon began to win. No matter how carelessly he threw the dice, they delivered victory. And as the final game drew to a close, it was clear that Balmytria was about to lose eveything.": "当她的丈夫一局又一局地输掉游戏时，露瑟莉亚静静地坐着，将魔法编织进骰子中。即使在泰莱亚最伟大的咒语也似乎没有任何效果。绝望之际，她开始将她的神圣力量注入骰子中。当魔法能量控制了骰子时，她感到自己变得虚弱——西顿开始获胜。无论他如何随意地投掷骰子，它们都带来胜利。随着最后一局接近尾声，很明显巴尔米特里亚即将失去一切。",
	"Laughing, arrogant, triumphant, the Twin Titans threw open their mouths and shouted in the face of the silver dragon, \"You are nothing. {@italic You are nothing.}\"": "笑着、傲慢、得意洋洋，双子泰坦打开嘴巴，冲着银龙大喊道：“你什么都不是。{@italic You are nothing.}”",
	"But Balmytria only smiled. \"I have staked my life on this game, and you have staked your divine power. You gave your divine power to win this game, but now I give my life to match your sacrifice.\" With this, she plunged a dagger into her chest, and her blood spilled across the twenty squares, soaking the enchanted dice.": "但巴尔米特利亚只是微笑着。“我已经拿我的生命来打这场游戏，而你拿你的神力作为赌注。你曾经用你的神力来赢得这场游戏，但现在我拿我的生命来匹敌你的牺牲。” 说完，她将匕首刺入胸口，鲜血流过二十个方块，浸湿了被施了魔法的骰子。",
	"When Balmytria's blood mixed with the magic of the dice, the fate of the world was forever altered.": "当巴尔米特利亚(Balmytria)的血液与骰子的魔法混合在一起时，世界的命运永远改变了。",
	"Balmytria knew the dragons could not defeat the immortal Titans unless they became immortals themselves. That was her plan all along. She never intended to kill Sydon and Lutheria, for she knew that the Fates were working against her. Instead, she sought to steal the divine power of the Titans for her own blood.": "巴尔米特里亚(Balmytria) 知道龙们无法击败不朽的泰坦(Titans)，除非它们自己也变成不朽的存在。这一直是她的计划。她从未打算杀死赛登(Sydon)和卢塞里亚(Lutheria)，因为她知道命运正在与她作对。相反，她试图窃取泰坦的神力，融入自己的血脉中。",
	"As Balmytria's blood drained from her body, the Titans' divine power replaced it. She ascended into the heavens as Mytros, the Goddess of Dawn. Her husband became Volkan, the God of the Forge. Her children became Vallus, the Goddess of Wisdom; Pythor, the God of Battle; Narsus, the God of Beauty; and Kyrah, the Goddess of Music. Together, this new pantheon would turn the tide of the war completely.": "当巴尔米崔娅的鲜血从她的身体中流出时，泰坦神的神力取代了它。她升入天堂，成为黎明女神迈特洛斯(Mytros)。她的丈夫成为锻造之神沃尔坎(Volkan)。她的孩子们成为智慧女神瓦鲁斯(Vallus)；战斗之神皮索(Pythor)；美丽之神纳尔苏斯(Narsus)；以及音乐女神凯拉(Kyrah)。这个新的万神殿将彻底扭转战争的局势。",
	"History says the dragons are gone, but that is not entirely true. The dragons are still here, but they have been changed into something even greater. Mytros won the war that could not be won by sacrificing herself and ensuring a future for all the mortals of Thylea.": "历史说龙已经消失了，但这并不完全正确。 龙仍然存在，但它们已经变成了更伟大的存在。 Mytros通过牺牲自己赢得了那场无法取胜的战争，并确保了泰利亚所有凡人的未来。",
	"If you desire it, I will tell you the story of how the Dragonlords were destroyed, and how the Oath of Peace came to be.": "如果你愿意的话，我会告诉你龙主们是如何被摧毁的故事，以及和平誓约是如何产生的。",
	"With the arrival of the Five Gods, the Titans faced an existential threat. They were badly weakened from the fighting of the First War, and much of their divine power had been sapped away. Joined by the power of the Five Gods, the mortal armies were nigh unstoppable.": "随着五位神祇的到来，泰坦们面临着一场存在威胁。他们在第一次战争中已经严重削弱，许多神力已经消失殆尽。在五位神祇的力量加持下，凡人军队几乎无法阻挡。",
	"The Dragonlords made their final voyage into the Forgotten Sea, and great battles were fought over land and water. Eventually, the centaur armies were broken, and the gygan armies were all but exterminated. Sydon and Lutheria had very little left with which they could fight—but they were still gods.": "龙领主们进行了最后一次航行，进入了被遗忘之海，大规模的战斗在陆地和水域展开。最终，半人马军队溃败，巨人军队几乎被消灭殆尽。赛登(Sydon)和卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria)几乎没有剩下什么可以用来战斗，但他们仍然是神明。",
	"Lutheria lay claim to the vast underworld of the Nether Sea, capturing the souls of the dead to make up for what she had lost. Sydon secured his hold on the waters of Thylea, generating great storms that battered the mortal cities into submission. In this way, they forced a stalemate in the war, with the hope that they might recover from their losses.": "卢瑟利亚(Lutheria)声称拥有广阔的幽冥之海(Nether Sea)地底世界，捕捉死者的灵魂来弥补她所失去的。赛登(Sydon)巩固了他对泰利亚(Thylea)水域的控制，制造强大的风暴摧毁凡间城市，迫使其屈服。通过这种方式，他们在战争中达成了僵局，希望能够从损失中恢复过来。",
	"As the Titans consolidated their remaining power, they struck a revenge blow against the mortal armies. They hunted down and slaughtered most of the remaining Dragonlords, including Estor Arkelander, the captain of the {@italic Ultros}. The true fate of these brave warriors is largely unrecorded in the histories. In the end, both sides of the war were threatened with total annihilation.": "随着泰坦巩固他们剩余的力量，他们向凡人军队发动了报复性打击。他们追捕并屠杀了大部分剩余的龙领主，包括{@italic Ultros}的队长Estor Arkelander。这些勇士的真正命运在历史上大部分没有记录。最终，战争的双方都面临着被彻底消灭的威胁。",
	"Finally exhausted, the Titans and the Five Gods met once more beneath the great tree of the Golden Heart. They cut their hands and made blood handshakes, agreeing to a solemn truce for five hundred years. This agreement became known as the Oath of Peace, and Mytros, the Goddess of Dawn, sealed the oath with most of her remaining power.": "最终筋疲力尽，泰坦和五位神明再次在黄金之心巨树下相遇。他们割破手掌，进行血誓握手，同意在五百年内庄严停战。这个协议被称为和平誓约，黎明女神(Mytros)用她剩下的大部分力量来封印了这个誓言。",
	"Damon, the great wizard of the Dragonlords, saw it done. He carried the scroll of the oath and the bodies of the fallen Dragonlords back to the city. And then he disappeared into history.": "达蒙(Damon)，龙领主(Dragonlords)的伟大巫师，亲眼目睹了这一切。他带着誓约卷轴和倒下的龙领主的尸体回到了城市。然后，他就这样消失在历史长河中。",
	"Now, the time of mortals had come. The settlement of Mytros expanded into a great city, and it was protected by the twin Colossi forged by Volkan—beacons of civilization on the shores of a wild frontier. New settlers came from beyond the Forgotten Sea, and the mortal population of Thylea swelled.": "如今，凡人的时代来临了。米特洛斯（Mytros）的定居点扩展成了一座伟大的城市，它被由沃尔坎（Volkan）锻造的双子巨像所保护——这是文明的标志，矗立在荒蛮边疆的海岸上。新的定居者来自遗忘之海（Forgotten Sea）的彼岸，蒂莉亚（Thylea）的凡人人口膨胀壮大。",
	"The children of the Dragonlords became kings, and their dynasties ruled over new cities that sprang up across the land. As the worship of the Five spread, their power over the land and oceans grew, until every village boasted shrines to Volkan and Pythor. The dominion of Sydon and Lutheria was nearly forgotten.": "龙领主的子孙成为国王，他们的王朝统治着陆地上涌现的新城市。随着五位神灵的崇拜传播，他们对陆地和海洋的控制力增强，直到每个村庄都有供奉沃尔坎和派瑟的神龛。赛登和卢瑟利亚的统治几乎被遗忘了。",

Now, he is a vengeful and jealous god who suffers no worship of any gods except himself or his sister-wife Lutheria. He surveys both land and water tirelessly from his stronghold in the tower of Praxys.

Hexia has jealously dedicated her life to destroying Pythor's happiness and, over the centuries, she has murdered many of his mortal lovers and children.": "在龙领主时代，派索尔(Pythor)与他的义姐海克西娅(Hexia)结了婚，她是一只绿龙。派索尔在接受永生人形时抛弃了他的龙妻，她至今未原谅他。海克西娅嫉妒地将她的一生奉献给摧毁派索尔的幸福，几个世纪以来，她谋杀了许多他的凡人情人和子女。",
	"Pythor falls in love with literally every beautiful mortal who crosses his path. He just can't help himself, any more than a moth can help flying towards the candle flame. He is respectful but persistent in his attentions; jubilant in victory and gracious in defeat.": "Pythor爱上了每一个穿过他视线的美丽凡人。他就像飞蛾扑向蜡烛火焰一样，无法自拔。他尊重但又坚持地关注着；在胜利时欢欣鼓舞，在失败时优雅从容。",
	"Pythor is quick to volunteer to fight on the front lines of any battle that he happens across. These days, however, he is more often drunk than sober. He'll never admit it, but centuries of failure and personal tragedy have taken their toll on his fighting spirit. He believes his glory days are behind him, and he seeks to drown this fact in a river of wine.": "Pythor（皮索尔）总是迫不及待地自愿投身于他所遇到的任何战斗的前线。然而，最近，他更多的时候是醉醺醺而不是清醒的。他永远不会承认，但是几个世纪的失败和个人悲剧已经对他的战斗精神造成了影响。他相信他辉煌的日子已经过去，他试图用酒海淹没这个事实。",

	"Vallus is revered as the goddess of wisdom. She was once known to travel far and wide, surveying ancient ruins and collecting lore concerning the origins of the land and the fey races. Prayers are offered to Vallus when guidance is needed and information is scarce, and she is believed to know as much about Thylea's history as Sydon and Lutheria. She is the oldest daughter of Mytros and, in many ways, she has inherited her mother's place as patron goddess to the city that bears her name.": "瓦鲁斯（Vallus）被尊奉为智慧女神。她曾被认为游历遥远，考察古代遗迹，并收集关于大地起源和精灵种族的知识。当需要指引和信息稀缺时，人们会向瓦鲁斯祈祷，相信她对泰莱亚（Thylea）的历史了如指掌，不亚于赛登（Sydon）和卢瑟里亚（Lutheria）。她是迈特洛斯（Mytros）的长女，在许多方面，她继承了母亲的地位，成为了以她名字命名的城市的守护女神。",
	"Vallus works closely with the priests of Mytros to encourage faith in the Five, even as mortals everywhere fall prey to fear of Sydon and Lutheria. She remains a pillar of strength holding the city together as things are beginning to fall apart elsewhere. However, in spite of her best efforts, the citizens of Mytros increasingly offer prayers and sacrifices to the treacherous Titans. Vallus accepts this with grace and humility, and in spite of her declining power, she will do anything to defend her city.": "瓦卢斯（Vallus）与迈特洛斯（Mytros）的祭司密切合作，鼓励人们对五位神的信仰，即使到处都有凡人陷入对西顿（Sydon）和卢泰里亚（Lutheria）的恐惧之中。她仍然是这座城市的力量支柱，在其他地方开始出现混乱的情况下，她坚守着城市的统一。然而，尽管她尽力而为，迈特洛斯的市民越来越多地向那些阴险的泰坦神献祷文和祭品。瓦卢斯以优雅和谦卑接受这一切，尽管她的力量在减弱，她仍然愿意为保卫她的城市而不惜一切。",
	"Vallus has one regret: her marriage to King Acastus. Over the centuries, she has been intimate with many beautiful mortals who captured her heart, but her union with Acastus in 478 CE was entirely political. The two have grown to hate each over the years, not least because Acastus makes a point of treating his many infidelities as sport. They have no children, although Acastus probably has many unacknowledged bastards.": "瓦卢斯（Vallus）有一个遗憾：她与国王阿卡斯托斯（King Acastus）的婚姻。几个世纪以来，她与许多俘获她心的美丽凡人亲密接触，但她在公元478年与阿卡斯托斯的联姻完全是出于政治目的。这两人多年来互相厌恶，其中一个原因是阿卡斯托斯把他的许多不忠行为当作娱乐。他们没有孩子，尽管阿卡斯托斯可能有许多未被承认的私生子。",
	"Vallus was the young bronze dragon who served as a mount for Telamok Arkelander. While Telamok was responsible for almost as many atrocities as his brother Estor, Vallus understands this was part of the cost of settling in Thylea. She is not wracked with the same second-hand guilt that plagues Kyrah.": "瓦卢斯(Vallus)是年轻的青铜龙，曾作为泰拉莫克·阿凯兰德(Telamok Arkelander)的坐骑。虽然泰拉莫克负责的暴行几乎和他的兄弟埃斯托(Estor)一样多，瓦卢斯明白这是在泰莱亚定居的代价之一。她没有像凯拉(Kyrah)那样被同样的间接罪恶感折磨。",
	"Vallus has a reputation for conspicuous vanity. She never allows herself to be seen without exquisite, queenly regalia, and she habitually examines her own reflection in a silver hand mirror. This is partly because she understands the importance of appearances in the world of mortal politics—but she is also vain.": "Vallus（瓦鲁斯）以显眼的虚荣心而闻名。她从不允许自己没有华丽的、像皇后般的服饰出现，经常拿着银色手镜审视自己的倒影。这部分是因为她明白在凡间政治世界中外表的重要性，但也因为她本身虚荣。",
	"Vallus is extraordinarily perceptive, often to the point where she is suspected of mind reading. She always seems to discern truth, even when she is told a clever lie. A hard stare from Vallus is often enough to make even the most skilled liars concede the truth.": "Vallus（瓦卢斯）极其敏锐，常常让人怀疑她能够读心。即使被告知一个巧妙的谎言，她似乎总能辨别出真相。Vallus（瓦卢斯）的坚定凝视常常足以让即使是最熟练的说谎者也不得不承认真相。",
	"Vallus has lost much of her faith in the future of Thylea. Although she endeavors to protect the Temple of the Five in Mytros, she has witnessed too much of Thylean history to believe that the Oracle's prophecy will result in anything but total disaster.": "瓦卢斯（Vallus）对泰莱亚（Thylea）的未来失去了很多信心。尽管她努力保护在密特洛斯（Mytros）的五神殿（Temple of the Five），但她见证了太多泰莱亚历史，不相信神谕的预言会带来除了彻底灾难之外的任何结果。",
	"Acastus Arkelander has been the King of Mytros for two decades. As the husband to the goddess Vallus, he is the most powerful political figure in all Thylea, and he has a towering ego to match his fame. Although he is naturally charming, he is not a man who brooks being challenged or overshadowed.": "Acastus Arkelander已经担任Mytros的国王有二十年了。作为女神Vallus的丈夫，他是整个Thylea最有权势的政治人物，他的自负与他的名声相匹配。尽管他天生迷人，但他不是一个容忍挑战或被遮蔽的人。",
	"Beneath his outward confidence lies a deep-seated insecurity, because he has accomplished nothing important during his lifetime. He fears death, because he feels that he will quickly be forgotten. He desperately wishes to achieve immortality by increasing his fame, so that he will be remembered for many great deeds, like his ancestors.": "在他外表的自信之下，隐藏着一种根深蒂固的不安全感，因为他在一生中没有取得任何重要的成就。他害怕死亡，因为他觉得自己很快就会被遗忘。他拼命希望通过增加自己的名声来实现永生，这样他将因许多伟大的事迹而被记住，就像他的祖先一样。",
	"Acastus has no faith in the Oracle's prophecy, and he is immensely suspicious and jealous of her chosen \"heroes.\" He would rather believe that the heroes are not the answer to his kingdom's problems. He has solutions of his own: he has depended upon the Order of Sydon to maintain peace with the Titans for years. He also plans to rebuild the ancient Order of the Dragonlords with dragon eggs that Lutheria secretly gave him.": "阿卡斯塔斯对神谕的预言毫无信心，对她选定的“英雄”充满怀疑和嫉妒。他更愿意相信这些英雄不是解决他王国问题的答案。他有自己的解决方案：多年来，他一直依赖赛冬之序维持与泰坦的和平。他还计划利用路瑟利亚秘密给予他的龙蛋重建古老的龙领士团。",
	"King Acastus is one of several famous dragon-riders in Mytros. His mount is Icarus, an adult silver dragon who spends his time flying around the city, stealing cattle and over-fishing the waters beyond the harbor. Everyone considers Icarus to be a nuisance, but no one has ever dared to complain to the king. Acastus rides him around the city during festivals to show off his power. The dragon is only an adult because Acastus forced him to age quickly from the egg using potions of aging. Icarus still has the callow mind of a wyrmling.": "阿卡斯塔斯国王是迈特洛斯（Mytros）中几位著名的龙骑士之一。他的坐骑是伊卡鲁斯（Icarus），一只成年的银龙，经常在城市周围飞行，偷牛和过度捕鱼港口以外的水域。每个人都认为伊卡鲁斯是个讨厌的家伙，但没有人敢向国王抱怨。阿卡斯塔斯在节日期间骑着他在城市里游行，炫耀自己的力量。这条龙之所以只是一只成年龙，是因为阿卡斯塔斯用老化药剂迫使它从蛋中迅速成长。伊卡鲁斯仍然保留着幼龙的幼稚心智。",
	"Acastus's insecurity is made worse due to a connection he has with his direct ancestor, Estor Arkelander. Estor was the Dragonlord responsible for starting the First War, and is now the infamous captain of the ghost ship, the Ultros. Every night Estor whispers in Acastus's dreams, taunting him for his lack of achievements. The ghost has promised Acastus the immortality that he so desires, but only if he makes himself a willing vessel.": "Acastus的不安全感变得更糟，因为他与直系祖先Estor Arkelander有着联系。Estor是引发第一次战争的龙领主，现在是臭名昭著的幽灵船长，乌尔特洛斯号的船长。每晚，Estor在Acastus的梦中低语，嘲讽他的成就不足。这个幽灵承诺给予Acastus他渴望的永生，但前提是他必须成为一个自愿的容器。",
	"I was never under any illusions about Acastus's true nature, but he was undeniably charming and handsome and ambitious. Mother forgive me, but I could never resist that particular combination.": "我从未对(Acastus)的真实本性抱有任何幻想，但他无可否认地迷人、英俊而雄心勃勃。母亲，请原谅我，但我无法抗拒那种特别的组合。",
	"Acastus's marriage to the goddess Vallus has suffered over the years, mostly thanks to his own pride. He believed that winning the hand of the goddess was a sign of great things to come. Over the years, the romance turned sour as the king's obsession with fame became clear. Now, the two can barely stand to be in the same room together and view the marriage as a sham. Acastus has brazenly taken consorts that he has openly paraded before his estranged wife.": "阿卡斯塔斯（Acastus）与女神瓦卢斯（Vallus）的婚姻多年来备受磨难，主要是由于他自己的骄傲。他曾相信赢得女神的芳心是一个好兆头。随着时间的推移，这段浪漫的关系变得酸苦，因为国王对名望的痴迷变得明显。现在，这两人几乎无法忍受彼此的存在，他们视婚姻为虚伪。阿卡斯塔斯大胆地与其他女子有染，并公开在他疏远的妻子面前炫耀。",
	"Acastus makes a great show of treating guests well. He conducts himself with apparent grace, humility, and amiable good cheer. His true nature is nearly impossible to discern, even by the most perceptive and suspicious observers.": "Acastus（阿卡斯托斯）表现出色地款待客人。他举止优雅，谦逊友善，看起来心情愉快。他的真实本性几乎不可察觉，即使是最敏锐和怀疑的观察者也很难看透。",
	"Acastus's loyalties change, sometimes in the space of moments, depending on his understanding of the power balance in Thylea. He is adept at making promises that he never intends to keep, but he's careful never to swear oaths that would bind him to what might be the losing side in a battle.": "Acastus（阿卡斯托斯）的忠诚度会变化，有时甚至在瞬息之间，取决于他对泰勒亚（Thylea）权力平衡的理解。他擅长做出永不打算遵守的承诺，但他小心翼翼地不会发誓绑定自己到可能是战斗失败一方的誓约。",
	"Bullbug is a pot-bellied minotaur gladiator with a sunny disposition and a penchant for drinking. Contrary to the reputation that minotaurs have in Mytros, he doesn't have an evil disposition or a lust for blood. He has a different view on life than many of his kind, because he was raised by a human family who treated him like a son.": "Bullbug是一个大肚子的牛头人角斗士，性情开朗，喜欢喝酒。与迷特洛斯（Mytros）中牛头人的恶名相反，他并没有邪恶的性情或对鲜血的渴望。他对生活有着与他种族许多成员不同的看法，因为他是被一个人类家庭抚养长大，他们把他当作自己的儿子对待。",
	"As a youth, Bullbug gained the distinction of being one of the few minotaurs to survive the sacrificial rituals in Mytros. He refused to kill the warriors he defeated, and so gained the sympathy of the family matron who took Bullbug into her home and raised him as a son. But then, several years ago, Bullbug's family were killed by the Order of Sydon, and he was sold into slavery.": "作为一个年轻人，牛虫(Bullbug)因为成为少数几个在迷特洛斯(Mytros)的祭祀仪式中幸存下来的牛头人之一而获得了荣誉。他拒绝杀死他所打败的战士，因此赢得了家族女族长的同情，女族长将牛虫带进家中，并把他抚养成为自己的儿子。但几年前，牛虫的家人被赛登教团(Order of Sydon)杀害，他被卖为奴隶。",
	"Bullbug is not very bright, but he's reliable in a fight and he's loyal. He loves to make terrible jokes at the expense of his own species. When he makes an especially bad mistake, he usually blames it on his \"stupid cow brain.\"": "Bullbug（牛虫）并不聪明，但在战斗中很可靠，而且很忠诚。他喜欢以牺牲自己物种为代价的糟糕笑话。当他犯了特别严重的错误时，他通常会归咎于自己的“愚蠢牛脑”。",
	"Bullbug is always true to his word, and he would never dream of breaking an oath. He believes in the power of friendship and family. He will always be there for the people he cares for, and for those who care about him.": "Bullbug（牛虫）始终言出必行，绝不会违背誓言。他坚信友谊和家庭的力量。他会始终支持在乎的人，也会为在乎他的人而存在。",
	"Bullbug is always hungry, and he'll eat just about anything. He often thinks with his stomach, and this gets him into all sorts of trouble, because food is not usually free.": "Bullbug总是饥饿的，他几乎什么都会吃。他经常用肚子来思考，这让他陷入各种麻烦，因为食物通常不是免费的。",
	"The infamous captain of the ghost ship Ultros, Estor Arkelander has sailed the waters of the Cerulean gulf for centuries.

	"Estor was the brother of the Dragonlord Telamok Arkelander. He was intensely jealous of Telamok's fame and sought to eclipse him whenever possible.

	"He searched for fame and more power with increasing urgency as the First War dragged on. Eventually, this led him to take his ship to the fires of Typhos, a mysterious island where he felt that he could gain god-like power. Typhos proved to be a trap set for him by the goddess Lutheria, who tricked Estor into accepting her gifts of fame and immortality. She delivered these by turning him and his crew into undead, and cursing them to sail the Cerulean Gulf for all eternity.": "随着第一次战争的拖延，他越来越急切地寻求名望和更多权力。最终，这导致他带着他的船前往泰福斯之火，这是一个神秘的岛屿，他觉得自己可以获得类似神的力量。泰福斯被证明是女神卢瑟莉亚为他设下的陷阱，她诱使埃斯托接受她赐予的名望和永生。她通过将他和他的船员变成不死之身，并诅咒他们永远在青蓝海湾航行来实现这一点。",
	"Estor is, and perhaps always was, cruel and calculating. His centuries as a ghost have given him focus: he is still driven by the desire to outstrip his brother in all things. Now, he seeks to do this by taking over the life of the greatest of the prophesied heroes, and using that stolen life to exact brutal vengeance against the Titans.": "埃斯托尔是残忍和精明的，也许一直都是如此。作为一个幽灵的几个世纪让他更加专注：他仍然被超越他的兄弟的欲望所驱使。现在，他试图通过接管被预言为最伟大英雄之一的生命，并利用那个被窃取的生命来对泰坦实施残酷的复仇来实现这一目标。",

	"Marble golems are animated by spirits plucked from the elemental planes and forcibly bound into artificial bodies. The spirits unwittingly attracted to these particular constructs are always vain, and golem builders take advantage of their conceited natures when weaving the necessary binding spells.

Despite their focus on warfare, centaurs are a highly cultured people who produce impressive works of art and song, though these are rarely shared with outsiders.": "半人马文化非常强调战斗技能，通常期望他们在足够大拿起武器的时候就开始磨练战斗技能。半人马偏爱长弓和长柄武器，后者让他们在与较小种族作战时能够充分利用自己的体型优势。尽管他们专注于战争，半人马是一个非常有文化底蕴的民族，创作出令人印象深刻的艺术作品和歌曲，尽管这些作品很少与外人分享。",
	"Centaurs feel a special connection to nature and exact vengeance upon any who disrespect it. Inborn aptitude for the druidic arts is common among centaurs. Young centaur foals who show an aptitude for spellcasting are quickly identified and trained as druids from an early age. Centaur druids are highly respected among their peers, for they are more deeply connected to the land and to the stars than most races.": "半人马对大自然有着特殊的联系，对任何不尊重大自然的人都会进行报复。半人马中普遍具有德鲁伊艺术的天赋。展现出施法天赋的年幼半人马小马驹会很快被识别并从小就接受德鲁伊的训练。半人马德鲁伊在同行中备受尊敬，因为他们与大地和星辰的联系比大多数种族更加深厚。",
	"Centaurs do not create permanent settlements and instead constantly roam, setting up new temporary camps wherever the hunting is best. They look to the stars to determine when it is time to move on to new pastures. Living off of game and the occasional foraging, centaurs find the concept of agriculture very strange. Such practices require becoming rooted to one place, and they view the domestication of animals to be a complete perversion of nature.": "半人马不建立永久定居点，而是不断地漫游，根据狩猎地点的情况设置新的临时营地。他们观星辰以决定何时是时候转移到新的牧场。靠狩猎和偶尔的觅食为生，半人马觉得农业的概念非常奇怪。这样的做法需要固守一处，他们认为驯化动物是对自然的彻底扭曲。",
	"Centaurs are fiercely loyal to Thylea's native gods. Most tribes venerate the Mother Goddess Thylea, but many others worship the Twin Titans, Sydon and Lutheria.

	"Centaur history reaches back to long before the arrival of the settler races. When the first settlers arrived, the centaur tribes were largely indifferent to their presence. But during the First War, the Dragonlords and the Five Gods struck devastating blows against the centaur tribes. This has resulted in long-lasting enmity. Consequently, for the past several centuries, the centaurs have increasingly sought to drive the trespassing settler races out of Thylea by any means necessary.": "半人马历史可追溯到殖民者种族到来之前很久以前。当第一批殖民者到来时，半人马部落对他们的存在基本上漠不关心。但在第一次战争期间，龙主和五位神对半人马部落发动了毁灭性的打击。这导致了长期的敌意。因此，在过去几个世纪里，半人马们越来越努力地寻求通过任何必要手段驱逐侵入的殖民者种族离开锡莱亚。",

	"The origin of these outlandish cyclopes is unknown. Some scholars believe that their condition is a divine curse. Blemys progenitors may have comprised a civilization of particularly intelligent, charismatic, and social cyclopes that were uncharacteristically prone to vanity.

Robbed of their good looks and affluence, the blemys' civilization quickly collapsed, driving their descendants into lonely lives of perpetual dissatisfaction.": "这些古怪的独眼巨人的起源是未知的。一些学者认为他们的状况是一种神圣的诅咒。布莱米斯(Blemys)的祖先可能是一群特别聪明、有魅力和社交能力的独眼巨人，他们异常地容易傲慢自负。这可能与大多数独眼巨人不信教的特性相结合，吸引了残忍的神灵的注意，他们决定惩罚他们的骄傲和自恋。被剥夺了他们的美貌和财富，布莱米斯的文明迅速崩溃，将他们的后代推入了永恒不满的孤独生活中。",
	"Gygans are six-armed giants with a single eye. It is rumored that they are descended from an ancient cyclopean race that was spawned by the gods and thrived millennia ago.

These newcomers construct their own homes nearby, creating patches of relatively secure farmland between estates. Gygans within these family groups cooperate to produce food, wine, clothing, art, and entertainment. These self-sustaining communities rarely interact with non-gygans. Consequently, each insular family group develops a distinct culture that may be lost completely if disaster strikes the community.

This, combined with their great strength and erratic, unpredictable behavior, makes the gigantes a particularly dangerous foe.": "身心扭曲，丑陋的巨人族（Gigantes）如果不是因为他们的残忍和嗜血，本应是一种可怜的巨人形态。巨人族感到驱使去杀死任何他们遇到的智慧生物，除了其他巨人族之外——尽管他们暴力和失控的本性意味着即使是巨人族之间的小争执通常也以流血收场。尽管存在这些缺陷，巨人族远非愚蠢的野兽，平均而言，巨人族和普通人类一样聪明。这一点，加上他们的强大力量和不稳定、难以预测的行为，使得巨人族成为一种特别危险的敌人。",

Occasionally, gigantes tribes will work with minotaurs, as they feel some kinship to the cursed bull-headed humanoids.": "巨人对所有其他种族都持敌意。他们自毁倾向强烈，甚至对自己的生命也毫不在意，一旦巨人发起战斗，几乎总是战斗到死。偶尔，巨人部落会与牛头人合作，因为他们觉得与这些被诅咒的牛头人类有些亲缘关系。",
	"Although gigantes form social groups, these bands can hardly be called a \"community.\" Each loosely structured group is held together by two or three gigantes witches that claim to draw power from their sleeping god, Hergeron.

	"More monstrous than other medusae, a euryale's human aspects have almost entirely vanished. Its previous, weak humanoid body has been replaced with a massive snake-like torso, and its muscular, scaly arms possess strength rivaling a hill giant. The euryale's serpentine body can encircle and crush smaller creatures with ease. Barbed, venomous quills line the bodies of some euryales, and these quills can be detached and used as arrows to strike at foes that stand out of reach.": "比其他美杜莎更加凶残，一只尤里阿莱（Euryale）的人类特征几乎完全消失。它以前虚弱的人形身体已被巨大的蛇身所取代，其肌肉发达、鳞片覆盖的手臂拥有与山岭巨人匹敌的力量。尤里阿莱的蛇形身体可以轻松环绕并压碎较小的生物。一些尤里阿莱身体上长有带刺的、有毒的羽毛，这些羽毛可以被拆下并用作箭矢，射击那些无法触及的敌人。",
	"Despite this grotesque bodily transformation, the euryale's face continues to be eternally young and beautiful, if somewhat unsettling. This ensures that the terms of the pact or \"boon\" that created the original medusa remains unbroken.": "尽管发生了这种怪诞的身体变化，尤里阿莉的脸仍然保持着永远年轻美丽的外表，尽管有些令人不安。这确保了创造原始美杜莎的契约或“恩赐”的条件保持完整。",
	"Time alone is not enough to transform a medusa into a Euryale. Those that wish to gain greater power must seek out a mighty malevolent entity, such as a demon lord or archdevil.

In other cases, capricious beings may transform the medusa for no better reason than their own amusement, hoping to unleash chaos upon the Material Plane. The rare euryale that does not consent to this change often goes mad, leaving its lair to seek vengeance upon whichever unfortunate souls it happens to encounter.": "独自的时间并不足以将美杜莎转变为尤里亚莉。那些希望获得更大力量的人必须寻找强大的邪恶实体，比如恶魔领主或大恶魔。美杜莎可能会同意执行特定任务或者向这样的生物效忠，以换取它的魔法。在其他情况下，变幻莫测的存在可能会无缘无故地将美杜莎转变，只为了自己的娱乐，希望在物质位面上制造混乱。那些不同意这种变化的罕见尤里亚莉通常会变得疯狂，离开巢穴寻求报复，找到任何不幸遭遇的灵魂。",

Something that the Mother Goddess would not wish to destroy; something she was forced to contain...": "尽管经过多年的研究，我只能对泰坦愚者监狱下隐藏的谜团猜测一二。那里不可能是某种平凡的邪恶，比如恶魔；有更好的监狱可以关押这类东西。不，无论在那个岛上潜伏着什么，它必定是因其存在本身而危险的东西。这是母神不愿毁灭的东西；是她被迫要封印的东西...",
	"The myrmekes are a tenacious insect-like race that resemble gigantic humanoid ants with shiny black carapaces and beautiful, multicolored wings. A single myrmekes is small and poses little threat. They are made dangerous by their vast numbers: adventurers are very unlikely to encounter just one or two myrmekes. As eusocial beings with a shared hive-mind intelligence, myrmekes maintain constant telepathic communication with all nearby fellows. This creates a network that can respond to distress calls across an expansive territory controlled by the myrmekes.": "蚁人(Myrmekes)是一种顽强的类昆虫种族，它们类似于巨大的人形蚂蚁，身披闪亮的黑色甲壳，拥有美丽多彩的翅膀。单个蚁人很小，威胁不大。它们之所以危险，是因为数量庞大：冒险者很少会只遇到一两只蚁人。作为具有共享蜂巢意识的社会性生物，蚁人与附近所有同伴保持着持续的心灵感应交流。这样就形成了一个网络，可以响应蚁人控制的广阔领土上的紧急呼救。",
	"Although not inherently malevolent, myrmekes are a significant threat to all other forms of life in any ecosystem they enter. Their industrious nature, instinct for aggressive expansion, rapacious consumption of resources, and rapid breeding makes the myrmekes incompatible with other creatures. Consequently, the gods imprisoned the myrmekes on a remote island not long after their creation. In addition to the physical barriers surrounding them, the myrmekes are also bound by powerful magic to ensure their eternal isolation. However, if this enchantment was ever broken, these creatures could swarm over every continent, remaking the entire world as an insectoid empire.": "虽然蚁兽并非天生恶意，但它们对进入的任何生态系统中的所有其他生物都构成重大威胁。它们勤劳的天性、侵略性扩张的本能、贪婪的资源消耗以及快速繁殖使得蚁兽与其他生物不兼容。因此，众神在蚁兽创造后不久就将它们囚禁在了一座偏远的岛屿上。除了围绕它们的物理屏障外，蚁兽还被强大的魔法所束缚，以确保它们永远孤立。然而，如果这个魔法被打破，这些生物可能会蜂涌而至，重新塑造整个世界，建立一个昆虫帝国。",
	"Most myrmekes belong to the worker caste. This subtype is unremarkable, but because of their shared hive mind, even the lowliest drone has a direct link to the queen and access to her unfathomable intelligence. This allows myrmekes to mimic the abilities and traits of other creatures after observing them just once. Additionally, though they lack creativity, this gives myrmekes workers a genius-level intelligence rivaling that of even the most gifted humans.": "大多数蚁兽属于工蚁阶层。这个亚型并不引人注目，但由于它们共享的蚁穴意识，即使是最卑微的工蚁也能直接与女王联系，并获得她难以理解的智慧。这使得蚁兽能够在仅观察一次后模仿其他生物的能力和特征。此外，虽然它们缺乏创造力，但这使得蚁兽工蚁拥有媲美甚至最有天赋的人类的天才级智慧。",
	"Myrmekes that come into contact with other intelligent civilizations assimilate the knowledge and that culture which the myrmekes hive mind deems valuable to its own continued survival. The results of this process are embodied by the {@bold myrmekes advanced}. These creatures are more skilled than the workers and wield advanced magic. They can use newfound knowledge to fight with weapons and supplement their naturally tough exoskeletons with metal armor.": "当蚁人族群与其他智慧文明接触时，会吸收蚁人集体意识认为对其生存至关重要的知识和文化。这个过程的结果体现在{@bold myrmekes advanced}身上。这些生物比工蚁更加熟练，能够施展高级魔法。它们可以利用新获得的知识使用武器，并用金属盔甲增强其天生坚硬的外骨骼。",
	"The queen is the central hub of the swarm's hive mind. She also serves as the mother to all myrmekes, laying countless eggs each day. Despite her larger size and superior intellect, the myrmekes queen is physically weak and extremely vulnerable to attack if caught alone. In fact, it is her great size that makes her too slow to effectively use mimicry, cast spells, or avoid incoming attacks. In the unlikely event that enemies breach her royal chamber, she relies on her subjects to defend her. However, because the myrmekes have never lost a queen to sudden death or assassination, it is uncertain how a violent end for the queen would affect myrmekes civilization. Her loss might disrupt the hive mind completely.": "女王是蚁群意识的中枢。她也是所有蚁族的母亲，每天产下无数的卵。尽管她体型较大，智力超群，但蚁族女王在身体上很虚弱，如果单独被捕捉到会极易受到攻击。事实上，正是她巨大的体型使她过于缓慢，无法有效地使用拟态、施放法术或躲避来袭的攻击。在敌人不可能闯入她的皇家房间的情况下，她依赖她的臣民来保护她。然而，由于蚁族从未失去过一位女王，无论是突然死亡还是遭到暗杀，不确定女王的暴力结局会如何影响蚁族文明。她的损失可能会完全打乱蚁群意识。",
	"Mythic beasts are animals that carry a divine spark. These celestial creatures are neither good nor evil and while they are not unique, mortals rarely catch a glimpse of even one mythic beast in their lifetimes. The elusive beasts make their homes in the great forests and plains of both the fey and mortal realms. They are highly intelligent creatures that have the ability to speak. There are four mythic beasts spoken of in legends: the {@creature golden lion|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}, the {@creature white stag|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}, the {@creature great boar|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}, and the {@creature golden ram|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}.": "神话兽是携带神圣火花的动物。这些天体生物既不善良也不邪恶，虽然它们并非独一无二，但凡人一生中很少能见到一只神话兽。这些难以捉摸的生物居住在仙境和凡间的广袤森林和平原中。它们是高度智慧的生物，拥有说话的能力。传说中有四种神话兽：{@creature golden lion|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}、{@creature white stag|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}、{@creature great boar|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}和{@creature golden ram|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}。",
	"With its monstrous size and many fearsome tusks, there is no mistaking the great boar for an earthly creature. Great boar hunts are often organized to procure a grand sacrifice to the gods, though sometimes they are undertaken for the fame of slaying such a hugely fearsome creature. The great boar is dangerous for its amazing strength and deadly tusks, and because it brings madness to its foes. All but the most disciplined parties fall prey to this madness, and many hunters have died at the hands of their fellows.": "由于其庞大的体型和许多可怕的长牙，伟大野猪不可能被误认为是地球上的生物。 伟大野猪狩猎经常被组织起来，以供奉伟神，尽管有时也是为了杀死这种极为可怕的生物而获得名声。 伟大野猪因其惊人的力量和致命的长牙而危险，因为它会让敌人陷入疯狂。 除了最有纪律的队伍外，几乎所有人都会陷入这种疯狂中，许多猎人都死在同伴的手中。",
	"Running through forests on its bronze hooves is the white stag. Although not as physically imposing as the other mythic beasts, the unparalleled speed of the white stag make it a challenge to hunters. Despite its pure white fur, the stag can blend in perfectly with any shadows to evade even the most observant mortals. Hunting the white stag often represents a spiritual quest, and legends say that those who can catch the beast without killing it will be granted their greatest desire.": "在森林中奔跑的是白色雄鹿，它的青铜蹄子踏过大地。虽然在体型上不如其他神话生物那般令人印象深刻，但白色雄鹿无与伦比的速度使猎人们感到挑战。尽管它的皮毛洁白无瑕，但雄鹿可以完美地融入任何阴影中，甚至可以躲避最为警觉的凡人。追逐白色雄鹿常常代表着一场精神探索，传说说那些能够捕捉到这只野兽而不杀死它的人将被赐予他们最大的愿望。",
	"The most obviously \"celestial\" of the mythic beasts, the golden ram can traverse any terrain and can even run through the sky itself. They also possess innate healing magic and are said to be able to raise the dead. Like the golden lion's fur, the ram's brilliant golden fleece is a much sought-after component for magic items. Unlike the lion, however, the ram can be shorn, so it is not necessary to kill a golden ram to obtain its fleece. Instead, adventurers may choose to bargain with a golden ram or convince it of their great and worthy need for its fleece.": "这些神话生物中最明显“天上的”就是金羊，它可以穿越任何地形，甚至可以在天空中奔跑。它们还拥有天生的治愈魔法，并据说能够让死者复活。像金狮的皮毛一样，金羊闪亮的金色羊毛是制作魔法物品时备受追捧的材料。然而，与狮子不同，金羊可以被剪毛，因此并不需要杀死金羊才能获得它的羊毛。相反，冒险者可以选择与金羊讨价还价，或者说服它他们对金羊毛的巨大而有价值的需求。",
	"Nymphs are powerful fey who embody the splendor of the natural world. Architects of wild beauty, nymphs are bound to, and protect, the forests, rivers, springs, meadows, mountains, and seas they shape and call home. Nymphs feel a greater kinship to elves than do most other fey, and the two groups resemble each other in general appearance, though nymphs have more obviously supernatural features.": "仙女是强大的精灵，体现了自然界的壮丽。作为野性美的缔造者，仙女与她们塑造和居住的森林、河流、泉水、草地、山脉和海洋紧密相连，并保护着它们。与大多数其他精灵相比，仙女与精灵有更深的亲缘关系，两者在外表上相似，尽管仙女具有更明显的超自然特征。",
	"All nymphs are incredibly beautiful and demand to be surrounded by aesthetically elegant creatures and items that rival their own appearance. They are chaotic beings that believe in the importance of beauty above all else. Rather than viewing the world in terms of good and evil, most nymphs see only beauty and ugliness. To them, actions that create beauty are laudable; beautiful creatures and objects must be protected. That which destroys or damages beauty, or promotes ugliness, must be eradicated.": "所有仙女都非常美丽，并要求周围环绕着美学优雅的生物和物品，与她们自己的外表不相上下。她们是混乱的存在，相信美比一切都重要。与其用善恶来看待世界，大多数仙女只看到美和丑。对她们来说，创造美的行为是值得赞美的；美丽的生物和物品必须受到保护。破坏或损害美丽的事物，或者促进丑陋的事物，必须被根除。",
	"Nymphs make homes in the most beautiful locations of the natural world. They augment these places, nurturing the plants, shaping the earth, and purifying the water. Those seeking a nymph should look to the most breathtaking natural landmarks in their vicinity as a sign of her presence. However, intruders are rarely welcome, as most nymphs prefer to live in solitude. Many nymph homes lie on the borders between the fey and the mortal realm. Time passes differently in these locations, and mortals who unwittingly wander into a nymph's domain for an afternoon may find themselves displaced by centuries in time.": "仙女们选择在自然界最美丽的地方建造家园。她们会增强这些地方，培育植物，塑造大地，净化水源。寻找仙女的人应该留意他们周围最令人惊叹的自然地标，作为她存在的迹象。然而，入侵者很少受欢迎，因为大多数仙女更喜欢独居。许多仙女的家园位于仙界和凡间之间的边界。在这些地方，时间流逝得与众不同，不经意间闯入仙女领地的凡人可能会发现自己在短短一个下午内被时间推移了数个世纪。",
	"Many prominent heroes of legend are thought to be the offspring of nymphs. Affairs between nymphs and mortals tend to be fleeting and frequently end in tragedy. Powerful mortals who are seduced into joining nymphs in the fey realm may disappear from the mortal realm for centuries, throwing kingdoms into chaos in the meantime. Nymphs taken into the mortal world as wives and husbands soon pine for the natural splendor of their wild homes, and they usually abandon their mortal families.": "许多著名的传奇英雄被认为是仙女的后代。仙女与凡人之间的恋情往往是短暂的，经常以悲剧收场。被诱惑进入仙境与仙女共度时光的强大凡人可能会在凡间消失数个世纪，同时也会让王国陷入混乱。被带到凡间作为妻子和丈夫的仙女很快就会渴望自己野生家园的自然辉煌，他们通常会抛弃他们的凡间家庭。",
	"Nymphs are divided into six subraces: dryads of the forests, naiads of lakes and rivers, nereids of the oceans, oreads of the mountains, oceanids of the islands, and aurae of the night sky.": "仙女分为六个亚种：森林中的树精( dryads )，湖泊和河流中的湖仙( naiads )，海洋中的海仙( nereids )，山脉中的山仙( oreads )，岛屿上的海女神( oceanids )，以及夜空中的风之女神( aurae )。",
	"Nymphs may be male, female, both, or neither. However, most nymphs possess certain delicate feminine qualities, regardless of their gender, and they are collectively described with feminine pronouns.": "仙女可能是男性、女性、两者皆有或两者皆无。然而，大多数仙女无论性别如何，都具有某些娇嫩的女性特质，并且通常用女性代词来描述他们。",
	"The lair of a nymph is a beautiful, natural place that reflects her type. For example, dryads make their lairs in the branches and roots of a great tree to which she is bound. Naiads often dwell within underwater caves that can only be reached by swimming beneath a river or lake. Oreads may choose picturesque ruins located high in the mountain that she calls home. When a nymph's lair contains a connection to the fey, or lies within the fey, she gains access to lair actions.": "一个仙女的巢穴是一个美丽而自然的地方，反映了她的种类。例如，树精常常在她所依附的巨大树木的树枝和根部中建造她们的巢穴。 水妖经常居住在只能通过在河流或湖泊下游泳到达的水下洞穴中。 山精可能会选择位于她称之为家园的高山上的风景如画的废墟。 当一个仙女的巢穴中包含与仙界的联系，或位于仙界内时，她就可以使用巢穴动作。",
	"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the nymph can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:": "在20号（失去先攻的情况下）的先攻顺序中，仙女可以采取巢穴行动，施加以下其中一种魔法效果：",
	"The nymph glimpses the future, so that it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.": "这位仙女可以窥见未来，因此在接下来的回合直到倡议计数达到20之前，它在攻击检定、能力检定和豁免检定上获得优势。",
	"The nymph merges with her surroundings and reappears anywhere in her lair. This ability functions exactly like dimension door except that it requires no components and the range is limited to within the nymph's lair.": "这位仙女融入周围环境，然后在她的巢穴中的任何地方重新出现。这种能力的功能与次元之门完全相同，只是不需要任何材料成分，且范围仅限于仙女的巢穴内。",
	"The region containing a nymph's lair is warped by the ephemeral nature of the feywild.": "仙女巢穴所在的区域受到了妖界瞬息万变的影响。",
	"Time passes differently in the lair of the nymph. Every day spent there counts as a month in the mortal world. The nymph can decrease this rate of time passage to a week or increase it to a year.": "在仙女的巢穴里，时间流逝得与凡间不同。在那里度过的每一天相当于凡间的一个月。仙女可以将时间流逝速度减少到一周，或增加到一年。",
	"Monstrosities, aberrations, fiends, and humanoids with Charisma scores of 8 or less feel extremely uncomfortable in a nymph's lair. They have disadvantage on all saving throws and ability checks.": "畸变体、畸形生物、恶魔和魅力得分为8或更低的人形生物在仙女的巢穴中会感到极度不适。它们在所有豁免 throws 和能力检定上都有劣势。",
	"Aurae are nymphs associated with the sea and the night sky, currents, breezes, and the constellations. Each aurae claims an island for her home, and she guards it with fearsome devotion. The most territorial of the nymphs, aurae have taken it upon themselves to stem the tide of civilization and do not tolerate mortals on their islands. They are not malicious or cruel, and they always give trespassers fair warning to leave. But if their words go unheeded, they will not hesitate to smite interlopers with all their power.": "海风仙女(Aurae)是与海洋和夜空、洋流、微风以及星座相关的仙女。每位海风仙女都会宣称一个岛屿为她的家园，并以可怕的忠诚守护着它。海风仙女中最有领土意识的，她们自愿阻止文明的潮流，不容忍凡人在她们的岛屿上。她们并非恶意或残忍，总会提醒闯入者离开。但如果他们的警告被忽视，她们将毫不犹豫地用尽全力惩罚闯入者。",
	"Aurae sometimes become muses for mortals. These nymphs have an innate fascination with words and language, and thrill in the abilities of poets, storytellers, and lyricists. Some of history's greatest songs, poems, and tales are thought to have been inspired by aurae.": "Aurae（风之灵）有时会成为凡人的缪斯。这些女神对文字和语言有着与生俱来的迷恋，对诗人、讲故事者和抒情诗人的才华感到兴奋。一些历史上最伟大的歌曲、诗歌和故事据说都是受到了风之灵的启发。",
	"Like other nymphs, aurae can charm others to fight for them, but they also wield great strength, both physical and magical. In battle, aurae weave fey magic into beautiful songs to lull their opponents to sleep and to inflict psychic harm through vivid nightmares.": "与其他仙女一样，气灵 (aura) 可以迷惑他人为其战斗，但她们也拥有强大的力量，无论是身体上的还是魔法上的。在战斗中，气灵将精灵魔法编织成美妙的歌曲，使对手入睡，并通过生动的噩梦造成精神伤害。",
	"Nymphs of fresh water, naiads make their homes in lakes, streams, brooks, and wetlands. Naiads are the nymphs that are most likely to come into contact with mortals.": "淡水仙女，(naiads)居住在湖泊、溪流、小溪和湿地中。 (Naiads)是最有可能与凡人接触的仙女。",
	"Humans need to be close to reliable sources of fresh water, and this frequently creates an overlap between the domains of mortals and naiads. Some naiads even choose to live in man-made structures, such as fountains and wells, if they deem them beautiful enough to call home. Although naiads are often very curious about the mortal world, their patience for the ugly noise and bustle of cities remains short.": "人类需要靠近可靠的淡水来源，这经常导致凡人和(纳伊阿德)之间领域的重叠。一些(纳伊阿德)甚至选择住在人造结构中，比如喷泉和井，如果它们足够美丽，足以称之为家。虽然(纳伊阿德)经常对凡人世界很好奇，但他们对城市中丑陋的噪音和喧嚣的耐心仍然很短。",
	"Naiads are coveted by mortals for both their great beauty and their talents. They often have the ability to divine the fate of mortals. They have been known to use this power to shape history, as mysterious oracles and advisors. Naiads also serve as muses to great artists and musicians, taking them to a level of creativity that only supernatural assistance can inspire. Thanks to these abilities, powerful mortals frequently fall in love with naiads, and they are the most likely of all nymphs to give birth to mortal children with grand destinies.": "（纳伊阿得）被凡人们渴望，因为她们既拥有极大的美丽，又有着非凡的才能。她们通常能够预知凡人的命运。已知她们利用这种力量来塑造历史，成为神秘的神谕者和顾问。纳伊阿得也是伟大艺术家和音乐家的缪斯，将他们带到只有超自然帮助才能激发的创造力水平。由于这些能力，强大的凡人经常会爱上纳伊阿得，她们是所有仙女中最有可能生下具有伟大命运的凡人孩子的。",
	"Nereids are beautiful female fey that dwell beneath the ocean waves. There, they fiercely defend coral reefs and all natural life that dwell within it. Although quick swimmers in their own right, nereids often seek the aid of dolphin or seahorse mounts to bolster their effectiveness in battle. Nereids are as attached to such creatures as paladins are to their steeds; should the animal fall in battle, its rider may be overcome by grief.": "涅瑞德(Nereids)是居住在海洋波浪下的美丽女性精灵。在那里，她们激烈地保卫珊瑚礁和其中居住的所有自然生物。尽管她们本身是快速的游泳者，涅瑞德经常寻求海豚或海马作为坐骑，以增强她们在战斗中的效力。涅瑞德对这些生物像圣骑士对待他们的坐骑一样依恋；如果动物在战斗中倒下，它的骑手可能会被悲伤所克服。",
	"Each nereid wields her own personal trident, which is grown from the same coral they protect. Although they are dangerous when threatened, nereid sightings are considered to be a portent of good luck for sailors. Wise captains know to steer clear of their reefs, so as to avoid damaging them with the ship's anchor.": "每位(涅莉德)拥有自己的个人三叉戟，它们是从它们保护的同一块珊瑚长出来的。虽然当受到威胁时它们是危险的，但(涅莉德)的出现被认为是对水手们的好运的预兆。明智的船长知道要远离它们的暗礁，以免用船锚损坏它们。",
	"In addition to their skill as warriors, nereids are also well known for their exquisite voices, which can travel through water undistorted. Unlike the songs of many other aquatic fey, nereids do not weave enchantments into their music; they sing for beauty's sake.": "除了作为战士的技能外，海妖（nereids）还以她们精美的声音而闻名，这些声音可以在水中传播而不失真。与许多其他水生仙族的歌曲不同，海妖并不在她们的音乐中编织魔法；她们只是为了美的缘故而歌唱。",
	"Nereids are sometimes mistaken for merfolk at first glance. They possess streamlined, slightly alien features that are as striking as they are beautiful. Diaphanous webbing connects the fingers and toes of a nereid, and their slick skin resembles that of a dolphin, albeit in various shades of blue and green. Some nereids have additional fish-like traits, such as visible gills and fins that run along their limbs and back, though this aspect of their anatomy is highly variable, depending on their tribe.": "海妖在第一眼看起来有时会被误认为是人鱼。他们拥有流线型、略带外星特征的容貌，既引人注目又美丽动人。海妖的手指和脚趾之间有透明的薄膜相连，他们光滑的皮肤类似海豚，尽管呈现出不同的蓝色和绿色调。一些海妖具有额外的鱼类特征，比如可见的鳃和沿着四肢和背部延伸的鳍，尽管这一解剖特征在很大程度上取决于他们的部落。",
	"Many nereids display a level of benevolence towards humanoids that is rare among fey. Nereids have been known to shepherd lost sailors safely back to civilization, provided that they show adequate respect for nature. Some nereids even establish long-term relationships with the sailors who frequent their waters, steering their ships away from the sea's many hidden dangers.": "许多海妖对人形生物表现出一种在精灵中很少见的仁慈。海妖被人们认为会护送迷失的水手安全返回文明社会，前提是他们对自然表现出足够的尊重。一些海妖甚至与经常出现在她们水域的水手建立起长期的关系，引导他们的船只远离海洋中众多的隐藏危险。",
	"Nereids are bound to protect a specific coral reef, just as dryads are bound to their forests. Overtly hostile nereids are rare, and they usually do not discourage the intrusion of mortals into their domains. However, visitors should be wary to not mistake their relatively kind natures for softness; should their homes be at all harmed or threatened, nereids retaliate en-masse with a piranha-like tenacity, giving no quarter to their prey.": "涅莉德(Nereids)被绑定来保护特定的珊瑚礁，就像树精(Dryads)被绑定在它们的森林中一样。公开敌对的涅莉德很少见，通常不会阻止凡人闯入它们的领地。然而，访客应该警惕，不要将它们相对友善的本性误解为软弱；如果它们的家园受到任何伤害或威胁，涅莉德会像鲟鱼一样顽强地集体报复，对猎物毫不留情。",
	"The sirens sang bright songs of joy,": "警报声唱着欢乐的明亮歌曲，",
	"they loved their kingdom so.": "他们深爱着他们的王国。(the kingdom)",
	"But when its pillars cracked and fell,": "但当其支柱破裂倒塌时，",
	"they watched it sink below.": "他们看着它沉入水底。",
	"For centuries, the city slept,": "几个世纪以来，这座城市一直沉睡着，",
	"in shallows far from shore.": "远离岸边的浅滩。",
	"Then sea nymphs came with songs renewed,": "然后海女伴随着更新的歌声而来，",
	"the kingdom to restore.": "恢复王国。",
	"Oceanids are a type of fey who travel the coasts, often bringing music and merriment in their wake. They are most well known for their fascination with humanoids and largely take on forms that mimic handsome male members of these races. Oceanids adore beauty of all kinds but personally lack subtlety. They are invariably flashy, dressing in brightly-colored clothing and heavily adorning themselves in jewelry.": "海女是一种仙灵，她们经常沿着海岸旅行，常常带来音乐和欢乐。她们以对人类的着迷而闻名，并且通常会取悦模仿这些种族中英俊的男性成员的形态。海女热爱各种美，但个人缺乏细致。她们总是花哨的，穿着色彩鲜艳的衣服，身上挂满珠宝。",
	"Oceanids are shapeshifters who typically take forms that are almost physically indistinguishable from male humanoids. An oceanid rarely assumes a single guise for more than a month or two at a time, but he may revisit an identity later on. Many bear minor tells that go largely unnoticed, such as too-green eyes or sweat that smells too closely of ocean brine. Though they may lack \"true forms,\" oceanids sometimes also appear as creatures akin to water elementals, albeit in a closer approximation of human shape.": "海女是变形者，通常采取与男性人类几乎在外貌上无法区分的形态。海女很少会连续一个月或两个月保持单一外貌，但他可能会以后再次采用这个身份。许多海女会有一些不太明显的细节，比如太绿的眼睛或者汗水闻起来太像海水。虽然他们可能没有“真正的形态”，海女有时也会以类似水元素生物的形象出现，尽管更接近人类的形状。",
	"Oceanids spend much of their time tricking and playing pranks upon mortals. These tricks are usually harmless, but they can be infuriating. A common example of an oceanid prank is to exchange jewelry for other valuable trinkets—items that soon crumble into sand once the oceanid takes his leave. However, some oceanid pranks can turn fatal, often in the form of drownings. In another favorite oceanid prank, the oceanid lures his target into dangerous currents with illusory calm waters.": "海女们大部分时间都在戏弄和恶作剧凡人。这些恶作剧通常是无害的，但也可能让人恼火。海女们常常会用珠宝换取其他有价值的小玩意，但一旦海女离开，这些物品很快就会化为沙。然而，有些海女的恶作剧可能会导致致命后果，通常以溺水的形式发生。在另一种常见的海女恶作剧中，海女会用虚幻的平静水域引诱目标进入危险的洋流。",
	"Although some oceanids are indeed malicious, any deaths resulting from their pranks are usually unintentional. Oceanids can be poor judges of mortal swimming ability and lead victims to their dooms in their ignorance. When such a fate befalls an object of an oceanid's affections, he may become so overcome with grief that he dissolves into seafoam.": "尽管一些海洋女神确实恶意，但由于他们恶作剧而导致的任何死亡通常是无意的。海洋女神可能对凡人的游泳能力判断不准确，导致受害者在无知中走向毁灭。当一个海洋女神的爱人遭遇这样的命运时，他可能会因悲伤而溶解成海沫。",
	"Like many fey creatures, oceanids have a fondness for music and are skilled players of lutes, lyres, and other stringed instruments. Many oceanids delight in sharing their expertise with humanoids, and their pupils often go on to become famous bards. Although not always a means of enchantment, some oceanids use their songs to magically attract mortals to the shore. Such lures are often necessary, as oceanids begin to lose their mental faculties if they stray too far inland. However, their intentions for doing so vary: one oceanid may simply want an audience, while another may seek to draw in new victims for his pranks.": "像许多精灵生物一样，海女精灵热爱音乐，并擅长演奏吉他、竖琴和其他弦乐器。许多海女精灵乐此不疲地与人类分享他们的专业知识，他们的学生经常成为著名的吟游诗人。虽然并非总是一种迷惑手段，一些海女精灵利用他们的歌声来魔法般地吸引凡人到岸边。这种诱惑通常是必要的，因为如果他们远离海岸太远，海女精灵会开始失去他们的心智能力。然而，他们这样做的意图各不相同：一个海女精灵可能只是想要观众，而另一个可能是想要吸引新的受害者来开他的恶作剧。",
	"I cannot help but adore the oceanids. Their pranks may be annoying at times, but they only ever intend to entertain. In some ways, they are the most naive of all nymphs, because they cannot make it very far inland, in spite of their insatiable curiosity.": "我无法不崇拜海洋女神。她们的恶作剧有时可能很烦人，但她们只是想取悦。在某种程度上，她们是所有仙女中最天真的，因为尽管好奇心旺盛，却无法走得太远离海岸。",
	"As the most airy of the nymphs, in demeanor and their chosen domains, oreads are reclusive creatures associated with mountains, skies, and clouds. They are mischievous and selfish, even by fey standards, and one of their favorite pastimes is to take a mortal lover to \"paradise.\" The lover is only returned to the mortal realm a century or more later, once their families and friends are all dead and gone. This is not always deliberate on the part of the oread—they simply don't give very much thought to the consequences of their actions on the lives of the mortals they beguile.": "作为仙女中最飘逸的，欧瑞德（Oreads）在举止和选择的领域中是隐居的生物，与山脉、天空和云彩有关。按照仙灵的标准，她们调皮自私，她们最喜欢的消遣之一是带一个凡人情人去“天堂”。情人只有在一个世纪甚至更久之后才会被送回凡间，那时他们的家人和朋友都已经去世。欧瑞德的行为并非总是故意的，她们只是不太考虑自己的行为对所迷惑的凡人生活的后果。",
	"Strangely, unlike dryads and most other fey creatures, oreads are consummate hunters. Mortals with exceptional hunting skills are not punished for killing animals on an oread's land, and may even be rewarded with a boon to improve their prowess. However, oreads take offense at mortal hunters who lack finesse. They are known to transform poor or needlessly cruel hunters into game animals as retribution for sullying their territory.": "奇怪的是，与树精和大多数其他精灵生物不同，奥瑞德（Oreads）是出色的猎人。具有卓越狩猎技能的凡人在奥瑞德的领地上捕杀动物不会受到惩罚，甚至可能会因此获得提升技艺的恩惠。然而，奥瑞德对缺乏技巧的凡人猎人感到愤怒。他们会将猎杀技巧差或无端残忍的猎人变成猎物，作为对其玷污领地的惩罚。",
	"Oreads are by far the most territorial of all nymphs. They may suffer mortal trespassers in their lands for a time, but always with the understanding that their sovereignty over that land must be honored and reaffirmed. They expect visiting mortals to make offerings of food and wine at shrines along the roads—failing to do so many provoke the oread into hunting trespassers as game. Additionally, if an oread takes a romantic interest in a mortal who passes through his territory, he may claim that mortal as his \"pet.\"": "奥瑞亚德 (Oreads) 是所有仙女中最有地盘意识的。他们可能会容忍一段时间内闯入他们领地的凡人，但必须理解，对他们土地的主权必须得到尊重和确认。他们期望来访的凡人在道路旁的神龛上献上食物和酒祭品 — — 如果未能这样做，可能会激怒奥瑞亚德，使其将闯入者视为猎物。此外，如果一位奥瑞亚德对途经其领地的凡人产生了浪漫兴趣，他可能会将那个凡人视为自己的“宠物”。",
	"I once allowed myself to become an oread's pet, though his charms were less effective on me than he believed. He was a skilled hunter, in more ways than one, and I'll always cherish the time we spent together in \"Paradise.\"": "我曾经允许自己成为一位奥瑞亚德（Oread）的宠物，尽管他的魅力对我产生的影响比他所认为的要小。他是一位熟练的猎手，在很多方面都是如此，我会永远珍惜我们在“天堂（Paradise）”中共度的时光。",
	"The depths of the Cerulean Gulf and the Forgotten Sea are home to many creatures of incredible size and ferocity. Occasionally, these enormous creatures may be glimpsed from the deck of a merchant ship—but any sailors who survive such an encounter are the lucky ones. From time to time, entire ships have been known to go missing while passing through relatively serene waters. These unfortunate vessels have almost certainly been swallowed by sea monsters.": "蔚蓝海湾和遗忘之海的深处是许多体型庞大、凶猛无比的生物的栖息地。偶尔，这些巨大的生物可能会被商船的甲板上瞥见，但任何幸存下来的水手都是幸运的。不时地，整艘船只在穿越相对宁静的水域时失踪。这些不幸的船只几乎肯定已经被海怪吞噬。",
	"When my children come of age, they will prove themselves worthy of my name by taming the mighty Cetea that sleep in  the depths. The creatures submit only to those who demonstrate an unbreakable will to dominate the oceans": "当我的孩子们到了适婚年龄，他们将通过驯服深海中沉睡的强大Cetea来证明自己配得上我的名字。这些生物只屈服于那些展现出无法动摇的统治海洋意志的人。",
	"Prowling the waters surrounding Thylea, the cetus is an abominable creature that closely resembles an enormous shark. Aside from its colossal size, the physical trait that most distinguishes a cetus from a normal shark are the multiple rows of wicked serrated teeth that extend the entire length of its gullet. Like those of a shark, a cetus's teeth gradually move forward and continuously replace its front teeth, which are frequently shed. Once separated, these teeth remain exquisitely sharp and are often used as spearheads by tool-using people in and around the ocean. Although they are usually solitary creatures, cetea have been known to serve as mounts for extremely powerful beings, such as gods who have managed to best them in combat.": "潜伏在泰莱亚周围的海域中，鲸鲨（cetus）是一种可怕的生物，与巨大的鲨鱼极为相似。除了其巨大的体型外，最能区分鲸鲨和普通鲨鱼的生理特征是它们整个喉咙长度上延伸的多排锯齿。与鲨鱼一样，鲸鲨的牙齿会逐渐向前移动，并不断更换前排牙齿，经常脱落。一旦脱落，这些牙齿仍然锋利异常，常被海洋周围的使用工具的人们用作矛头。虽然它们通常是孤独的生物，但已知鲸鲨曾被用作极为强大的存在的坐骑，比如在与它们搏斗中取胜的神祇。",
	"The biggest mistake one could make when confronting a cetus is to confuse it for a mindless beast. Cetea are clever monsters with intellects comparable to that of a human. As largely asocial creatures without other means of channeling their intelligence, cetea focus entirely on the hunt. The typical cetus memorizes every topographical detail in its territory, allowing it to easily herd opponents into dead ends while also avoiding areas that are unable to accommodate its massive bulk.": "面对一只海怪时可能犯的最大错误是将其误认为是一种无脑的野兽。Cetea 是聪明的怪物，其智力可与人类相媲美。作为主要不善社交的生物，没有其他途径来发挥它们的智慧，cetea 完全专注于狩猎。典型的 cetus 会记住领地内的每一个地形细节，这使它能够轻松地将对手赶入死胡同，同时避开无法容纳其庞大体型的区域。",
	"The natural lifespan of a cetus can span millennia, and most that stalk the depths are thousands of years old. Their sickly mottled flesh is marred by countless wounds, both pale scars and oozing fresh lacerations alike. Despite their strong constitutions, cetea heal more slowly than mortal creatures. This make cetea frequently mistaken for undead monsters, though they are actually believed to be fiendish in nature.": "鲸鱼的自然寿命可以延续数千年，大多数在深海中徘徊的鲸鱼都已经有数千年的岁月。它们病态的斑驳肌肤上布满了无数伤口，有些是苍白的疤痕，有些则是正在渗血的新伤口。尽管它们拥有强健的体质，但鲸鱼的愈合速度比凡人类生物要慢得多。这使得鲸鱼经常被误认为是不死怪物，尽管实际上它们被认为是邪恶的天性。",
	"One of the most grotesque monstrosities to ever roam the sea, Scylla is a gargantuan mass of writhing flesh driven by an endless hunger. Six massive canine heads stretch out on six long, serpentine necks that protrude from her largely featureless body. Each of her heavily scarred heads is equipped with three rows of serrated teeth that point downward, into a throat that is capable of swallowing a horse whole.": "Scylla (斯西拉) 是海洋中曾经漫步的最丑陋的怪物之一，她是一团巨大的扭动肉体，被无尽的饥饿所驱使。六个巨大的犬头伸展在六条长长的蛇颈上，这些蛇颈从她那基本上没有特征的身体上突出。她那被严重伤痕覆盖的头部每个都配备有三排向下指的锯齿，可以将整匹马吞下。",
	"Scylla's bulk is supported by a dozen muscular tentacles. Though her limbs are capable of moving her with surprising speed, Scylla prefers to take the role of an ambush predator, lying in wait and reaching out with her maws whenever prey wanders too close. Although Scylla prefers ocean waters, she can move just as easily on land should she ever be motivated to. She spends most of her time in the deepest parts of the ocean.": "斯西拉的身躯由十几根肌肉坚实的触手支撑着。虽然她的肢体能够以惊人的速度移动，斯西拉更喜欢扮演伏击捕食者的角色，潜伏等待，只有当猎物靠近时，她才会伸出她的大嘴。尽管斯西拉更喜欢海洋水域，但只要有动力，她也可以在陆地上同样自如地移动。她大部分时间都在海洋最深处度过。",
	"Scylla is able to feel nothing but hunger. Had she any thoughts to communicate, Scylla would nonetheless be incapable of expressing them. She \"speaks\" only in a cacophonous chorus of mad barks and whines, which is said to drive any who hear it insane.": "斯西拉（Scylla）只能感受到饥饿，如果她有任何想法要传达，她也无法表达。她只能用一种疯狂的吠叫和哀鸣的混乱合唱“说话”，据说会让任何听到的人发疯。",
	"Scylla originates from Typhon, an island whose magical energies birth countless other hybrid abominations, including chimeras and manticores. However, Scylla is Typhon's worst \"child\" by far, both in form and the amount of damage she wreaks. Some legends claim that Scylla was once a beautiful nymph who was imprisoned on Typhon for countless years. Over time, its corruption slowly twisted her body and mind into the monstrosity she is today. By the time she was strong enough to break free of her bonds, any semblance of the nymph she was had long been replaced by hunger and madness.": "斯西拉（Scylla）起源于泰豐（Typhon），这是一个充满魔法能量的岛屿，孕育了无数其他混合畸形生物，包括奇美拉（chimeras）和蝎尾狮（manticores）。然而，斯西拉在形态和造成的破坏程度上远远超过了泰豐的其他“孩子”。一些传说声称，斯西拉曾经是一位美丽的仙女，被囚禁在泰豐上无数年。随着时间的推移，腐化慢慢扭曲了她的身体和心智，使她变成了今天的怪物。当她足够强大以摆脱束缚时，她曾经是的仙女形象早已被饥饿和疯狂所取代。",
	"As its name suggests, the sea serpent is a monstrous snake that makes its home within the ocean waves. Many who face the creature never come close to seeing the end of its tail, as the sea serpent's body reaches hundreds of feet in length. The sea serpent is so large that its back creates the illusion of a chain of islands as it slithers through the waves. Often mistaken as a dragon due to its massive size, the sea serpent is actually descended from gargantuan, primordial snakes.": "正如其名所示，海蛇是一种生活在海洋波涛中的巨大蛇类。许多面对这种生物的人永远无法看到它的尾巴，因为海蛇的身体长达数百英尺。海蛇如此巨大，以至于它的背部在波浪中蜿蜒时会产生一连串岛屿的错觉。由于其巨大的体型经常被误认为是龙，但实际上海蛇是源自巨大的原始蛇类。",
	"Although the creature's diet mainly consists of whales and sharks, it is also a major hazard for sailors, as the large size and oblong shape of ships attract its attention. Assuming it has found a feast, the sea serpent wraps its coils around the vessel and squeezes until it becomes a splintered wreck. From there, it proceeds to attempt to swallow the structure whole—unless it is distracted by attacks from the ship's occupants.": "尽管这种生物的饮食主要包括鲸鱼和鲨鱼，但对水手来说，它也是一个重大威胁，因为船只的巨大尺寸和椭圆形状会引起它的注意。一旦它找到了美餐，海蛇就会将身体缠绕在船只周围，挤压直到它变成了支离破碎的残骸。然后，它会试图将整个结构吞下去——除非被船上乘客的攻击分散了注意力。",
	"Anyone wishing to fight a sea serpent should make killing the beast one's sole priority. Wounding the monster only makes it redouble its efforts in a fit of rage, and it always fights to the death. In the unlikely event that a creature survives the sea serpent's bite, the creature is nonetheless doomed, as the serpent will inevitably swallow any prey that it catches in its jaws. If swallowed whole, a victim is likely to only live a few minutes before being dissolved by the serpent's powerful stomach acid.": "任何希望与海蛇战斗的人都应该把杀死这个怪兽作为唯一的优先事项。伤害怪兽只会让它愤怒地加倍努力，它总是战斗到死。在不太可能的情况下，生物幸存于海蛇的咬伤，但无论如何注定要死，因为海蛇必然会吞下任何被它咬住的猎物。如果被整个吞下，受害者可能只能活几分钟，然后被海蛇强大的胃酸溶解。",
	"The sea serpent prefers to stay in deep waters. Its massive size makes maneuvering in the shallows difficult and across any appreciable amount of land impossible. Additionally, the creature bears a deep hatred of the sound of thunder and will dive deep to avoid electrical storms.": "海蛇更喜欢待在深水中。它巨大的体积使得在浅水中操纵困难，在陆地上移动更是不可能。此外，这种生物对雷声深恶痛绝，会深潜以避开电风暴。",
	"The serpents were the first masters of the sea, long before my father gave his blood to create me. But upon my birth, the creatures fled before the storm and recognized their new lord in all his glory.": "蛇族是海洋的第一主宰，在我父亲献出血液创造我之前很久就存在了。但在我的诞生之时，这些生物在风暴来临前逃离，并认识到他们新的主宰，展现出他所有的荣耀。",
	"Sometimes called Gloom Hounds or Hounds of Hades, these three-headed creatures are bred to be the ultimate guardians. Very few creatures can successfully sneak past a cerebus hound that guards a doorway or treasure.": "有时被称为阴郁猎犬或哈迪斯猎犬，在当地被培育成终极守卫者。很少有生物能成功地潜过守卫门户或宝藏的刻耳柏斯猎犬。",
	"Hags train these creatures through abuse designed to instill fear and rage. No hound in their charge is ever shown affection, and they are kept either in total isolation or attached to chains too short to allow the pups to comfort each other. Large groups of cerberus hounds are sometimes given very little food, in order to identify weaker dogs for culling. The hags then sew shut the mouths of the runts and encourage their former packmates to devour them. The hags also present the hounds with captive humanoids, bound and mutilated, in order to give them a taste for blood.": "巫婆通过虐待训练这些生物，旨在灌输恐惧和愤怒。他们从不对这些猎犬表现出任何情感，要么让它们完全孤立，要么用过短的链条拴住它们，以防止小狗们互相安慰。有时，一大群地狱三头犬会被给予非常少的食物，以便辨别出较弱的狗进行淘汰。巫婆会缝合那些弱小狗的嘴巴，并鼓励它们以前的同伴吞食它们。巫婆还会向这些猎犬展示被捕获的人形生物，他们被捆绑和肢解，以便让它们尝到鲜血的滋味。",
	"Cerebus hounds can spawn litters of death dogs. They will only do this if there is enough food to satiate the hunger of all the hounds. The death dogs acknowledge the cerebus as the pack alpha. Whenever a cerebus dies, the death dogs fight for primacy. The victor devours the losers, and over the course of a month, it grows a new head, becoming a new cerebus to replace the original.": "冥犬（Cerebus）能生出死犬（death dogs）的幼崽。只有当有足够的食物来满足所有犬只的饥饿时，它们才会这样做。死犬承认冥犬为领袖。每当一只冥犬死去，死犬们会为首领地位而战。胜者吞噬失败者，在一个月的时间里，它长出一个新头，变成一个新的冥犬来取代原来的。",
	"Cerberus hounds take pride in sniffing out and devouring trespassers. Once they have been set to guard something, they never tire of their charge, even should hundreds of years pass without incident. Most hounds keep piles of their victims' bones as beloved trophies to gnaw on. Although the hound does require sleep, it rarely succumbs to the urge, and only one of its heads sleeps at any given time.": "地狱三头犬以嗅出并吞噬入侵者为荣。一旦它们被派去守卫某物，即使数百年没有事件发生，它们也永不厌倦。大多数犬类会保留它们的受害者骨头堆作为心爱的战利品来啃食。虽然这只犬需要睡眠，但它很少屈服于这种冲动，而且在任何时候只有一个头会睡觉。",
	"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the cerebus hound can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:": "在20号先攻（在先攻相同时失去）时，狗头三头犬可以采取巢穴行动，产生以下其中一种魔法效果：",
	"The cerberus creates the effects of the {@spell darkness} spell at a point located within 60 feet of it. This magical darkness spreads to a 30-foot radius (rather than 15). This effect ends when the cerberus dismisses it as an action, uses a lair action again, or dies.": "冥犬在距离它60英尺的地点产生{@spell darkness}法术的效果。这种魔法黑暗扩散到30英尺的半径范围内（而不是15）。当冥犬将其作为一个动作解散、再次使用巢穴行动，或死亡时，这种效果结束。",
	"Fire erupts from a chosen point within 60 feet of the cerebus in a 15-foot-radius sphere, until the hound dismisses it as an action, uses a lair action again, or dies. When the fire appears, each creature within the sphere must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 5d8} fire damage (or half as much on a successful save). A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the area for the first time or ends its turn there.": "火焰从距离犬头人60英尺内的一个选择点喷发出来，形成一个半径15英尺的球体，直到猎犬将其作为一个动作解散、再次使用巢穴行动，或者死亡。当火焰出现时，球体内的每个生物必须进行一次DC 20的敏捷豁免检定。未通过检定的生物会受到{@damage 5d8}火焰伤害（通过检定的生物受到一半伤害）。生物在第一次进入该区域或结束回合时也必须进行这次豁免检定。",
	"Dread beasts are hulking undead animals raised by Lutheria, Mistress of Death and Lady of Dreams. These creatures typify both of her domains, as these twisted mockeries of life are nightmarish indeed. Dread beasts engage in few—if any—of the behaviors they did in life and are almost universally driven to slaughter any humanoid they encounter. While most of these creatures lurk in the hidden, barely-trod corners of the world, others conduct nocturnal raids against villages and other civilized communities.": "恐怖野兽是由死亡女神露瑟莉亚(Lutheria)复活的庞大不死动物。这些生物体现了她统治的两个领域，这些扭曲的模仿生命的生物确实是噩梦般的存在。恐怖野兽几乎不再表现出它们生前的任何行为，几乎普遍地被驱使着屠戮任何它们遇到的人类。虽然大多数这样的生物潜伏在世界的隐秘、鲜有人迹的角落，但也有一些会在夜间袭击村庄和其他文明社区。",
	"After it has been raised, a dread beast continues to rot, creating a nauseating odor that is sometimes pungent enough to poison living creatures unlucky enough to be in its vicinity. Although the creature's flesh festers and falls away, this process does nothing to diminish its considerable strength. When a dread beast survives long enough, it eventually becomes little more than a skeleton, held together only by the will of powerful dark magic.": "在被唤起后，一头可怕的野兽继续腐烂，散发出一种令人作呕的气味，有时候这种气味足以毒害附近的生物。尽管这种生物的肉体溃烂并脱落，但这个过程并不会减弱它相当强大的力量。当一头可怕的野兽存活足够长的时间，它最终变成了不过是一具骨架，仅仅靠着强大黑暗魔法的意志维系着。",
	"Dread beasts are typically many times larger than their living counterparts. This gigantism is often due to the fact that dread beasts are frequently created from the remains of legendary mythic beasts. However, others are an amalgamation of multiple mundane animals. For example, many dread wolves have been stitched together from the flesh of entire packs.": "可怕的巨兽通常比它们活着的同类大几倍。这种巨大主要是因为可怕的巨兽经常是由传说中神话生物的遗骸创造而成。然而，其他一些巨兽是由多种平凡动物混合而成的。例如，许多可怕的狼是由整个狼群的肉体缝合在一起的。",
	"Some dread beasts are bound directly as servants of Lutheria and stand as guardians of things that the Titan holds dear. Others behave like revenants, hunting down and slaughtering their killers. Those created from mythic beasts are more likely to exhibit the latter behavior, frequently harassing heroes and adventuring parties.": "有些可怕的野兽直接被束缚为路瑟莉亚的仆人，并作为泰坦珍视之物的守护者。另一些则像亡灵一样行事，追捕并屠杀它们的杀手。那些由神话野兽创造的更有可能表现出后一种行为，经常骚扰英雄和冒险队伍。",
	"A dread beast can lash out at its enemies using the necrotic energy that sustains it. A bite from one of these monster drains the life force from its victim, and the resulting wound is highly susceptible to infection—assuming the victim survives the encounter.": "一只可怕的野兽可以利用维持其生命的死灵能量向敌人发动攻击。这种怪兽的咬击会从受害者身上吸取生命力，而由此造成的伤口极易感染——假设受害者在遭遇后幸存下来。",
	"Truthfully, even I cannot stomach the thought of encountering a dread boar. They are altogether revolting.": "说实话，即使是我也无法忍受遇到一头恐怖野猪的想法。它们简直令人作呕。",
	"Usually created from the remains of great boar of legends, dread boar lumber across the plains of the underworld and on the peripheries of civilization. Although still more intelligent than the average mundane boar, great boar are largely stripped of their cunning when they become dread beasts, leaving them husks of their former selves. Dread boar often haunt cemeteries where they desecrate the tombs and grave markers of mortals who have displeased their mistress.": "通常由传说中伟大野猪的遗骸所创造，恐怖野猪在冥界的平原上以及文明边缘漫步。尽管比普通野猪更聪明，但当它们成为恐怖野兽时，它们的狡诈大部分被剥夺，使它们成为往昔的空壳。恐怖野猪经常出没在墓地，它们亵渎那些得罪了它们女主人的凡人的坟墓和墓碑。",
	"The stench that cloaks a dread boar is even stronger than of other dread beasts. This is partly due to the creature's filthy, gore-caked tusks. Rather than being relegated solely to the creature's mouth, the necrotic black discharge that makes a dread beast's bite so deadly oozes continuously over the dread boar's deadly tusks.": "恐怖野猪身上弥漫的恶臭甚至比其他恐怖野兽更加强烈。这在一定程度上是因为这种生物那肮脏、血迹斑斑的獠牙。与其说这种腐蚀性的黑色分泌物仅仅存在于生物的口腔中，不如说它持续地从恐怖野猪的致命獠牙上渗出，使得恐怖野猪的咬击如此致命。",
	"Dread boar are driven by an insatiable hunger that is a far greater threat to the civilized world than their murderous tempers. A single dread boar can devour entire fields of crops and herds of livestock in a matter of hours. If left unchecked and allowed to encroach upon humanoid settlements, a dread boar makes short work of all available food stores, leaving the residents to starve. Lutheria sometimes personally sends these creatures to plague prosperous cities she believes have not offered her adequate sacrifices.": "恐怖野猪被一种无法满足的饥饿驱使，这种饥饿对文明世界构成的威胁远远大于它们的凶暴脾气。一只恐怖野猪可以在几个小时内吞噬整片田地和牲畜群。如果不加以控制并允许它们侵入人类定居点，恐怖野猪会迅速耗尽所有的食物储备，让居民们饿死。露瑟莉亚有时会亲自派遣这些生物来困扰她认为没有给予足够祭品的繁荣城市。",
	"The relentless dread wolves track their prey with unerring precision. Once a dread wolf has smelled the blood of a living creature, it tirelessly pursues its quarry. Occasionally, dread wolves are used as hunting \"dogs\" by more intelligent monsters on the trail of particularly elusive human champions.": "无情的恐狼以毫无差错的精准追踪猎物。一旦恐狼闻到活物的血腥味，它就会不知疲倦地追逐猎物。偶尔，更聪明的怪物会将恐狼用作“狗”，帮助它们追踪那些极难捕捉的人类英雄。(dread wolf)",
	"The baleful glow of a dread wolf's eyes has the power to shake the nerves of even the most valiant warrior. This is not merely a reaction to the creature's repulsive appearance but rather a manifestation of the dread wolf's inner malevolence. The dread wolf is therefore able to use this ability at the most opportune time, focusing its enmity to invoke great fear in only its chosen targets.": "一只可怕的狼的眼睛发出的邪恶光芒有能力震慑甚至最勇敢的战士的神经。这不仅仅是对这个生物令人厌恶外表的反应，而是可怕狼内在邪恶的体现。因此，可怕的狼能够在最适当的时候使用这种能力，集中其敌意只对其选择的目标造成巨大恐惧。",
	"Although most dread wolves have been fashioned from the corpses of ordinary wolves, humanoids are occasionally selected to transform into these creatures upon death. Those so chosen are invariably evil and were often werewolves or prolific murderers—or both—in life.

	"Goatlings are diminutive, goat-headed creatures that walk upright on furry, cloven foot legs. Goatlings are born from the union of satyrs and maenads, and they live in tribes consisting of dozens of inbred siblings and cousins. They infest woods, mountains, and hills alike. They are often mistaken for satyrs, but they are smaller and stupider. Goatlings delight in tormenting mortals, and they are known to play mean-spirited, often fatal, pranks on unsuspecting travelers at night. The last thing that their victims hear is a chorus of bleating laughter from the darkness.": "山羊灵是小巧的、长着山羊头的生物，直立行走，脚上长着毛茸茸的、分蹄的脚。山羊灵是半人羊与狂欢女神的结合产物，它们生活在由数十个近亲兄弟姐妹组成的部落中。它们在森林、山脉和丘陵中都有出没。人们经常会把山羊灵误认为是半人羊，但它们更小、更愚蠢。山羊灵喜欢折磨凡人，以及在夜晚对毫无戒备的旅行者进行恶意的、常常致命的恶作剧。它们的受害者最后听到的是从黑暗中传来的一阵羊叫般的笑声合唱。",
	"Physically frail and slow-witted in comparison to their sires, goatlings are envious creatures that enjoy inflicting cruelty upon their betters. They devote their limited mental capacities to crafting vicious insults salted with fey magic that can send their targets into blind fits of rage.": "与他们的父辈相比，山羊羔身体虚弱，智力迟钝，是一种嫉妒心强的生物，喜欢对待比自己更优越的生物施加残忍。他们将有限的智力用于编织充满精灵魔法的恶毒侮辱，可以让目标陷入盲目的愤怒之中。",

	"\"Bite me, fart-face!\"": "\"咬我啊，放屁脸！\"",
	"Goatlings are fond of employing irony and twisted humor when setting their deadly traps. One common tactic of goatling tricksters is to use the cries of a human infant as a lure, though the \"infant\" is really a polymorphed compatriot. Sometimes the transformed goatling remains disguised during the tribe's attack, but the goatlings particularly enjoy the reveal of having the infant show its true form just as a mortal victim succumbs to their cruel attacks.": "山羊灵在设置致命陷阱时喜欢使用讽刺和扭曲的幽默。山羊灵恶作剧者常用的一种策略是利用人类婴儿的哭声作为诱饵，尽管这个“婴儿”实际上是一个变形的同伴。有时，变形的山羊灵在部落袭击中保持伪装，但山羊灵特别喜欢在一个凡人受到他们残忍攻击时，让这个“婴儿”展示真实形态的揭示。",

	"The so-called \"raving ones\" were once human, but they have been transformed into fey creatures to serve more powerful beings. Maenads resemble beautiful female satyrs, but they are unkempt, and their frenzied demeanor betrays their true nature. These agents of chaos now follow the gods and arch-fey of madness, lust, and pleasure. All aspects of the maenad's previous personality are replaced by mania and desire. Maenads often successfully use their allure to lead unwary travelers to their filthy dens, where they and their sisters fall upon them with murderous passion.": "所谓的“狂热者”曾经是人类，但他们已经被转变成精灵生物，为更强大的存在服务。狂女似美丽的雌半人马，但她们不修边幅，狂热的举止暴露了她们真正的本性。这些混沌之神和狂欢之神的代理人现在追随着疯狂、欲望和快乐的神灵和大精灵。狂女以前的个性的所有方面都被狂热和欲望所取代。狂女经常成功地利用自己的魅力引诱不谨慎的旅行者来到肮脏的巢穴，她们和她们的姐妹们会用充满激情的方式袭击他们。",
	"Humans rarely become \"raving ones\" by choice. Instead, the transformation is thrust upon them by powerful chaotic entities, often in the guise of mentors or teachers. The magic used to create a maenad typically comes from a strong bond to a lover, friend, or trusted elder. In the most common ritual, innocent young women are tricked or forced into consuming the flesh of a loved one. Others have become maenads after prayers to cure a dying loved one were cruelly answered. One particularly sadistic method of creating a maenad is to charm a victim and force her to beat a loved one to death with a fennel staff. The most benign method of transformation is as a punishment for the sins of another—when a loved one refuses to worship a god of madness or pleasure.": "人类很少会自愿成为\"狂热者\"。相反，这种转变往往是由强大的混沌实体强加给他们的，通常伪装成导师或老师。创造一个女狂热者的魔法通常来自于与恋人、朋友或信任的长者之间的强烈联系。在最常见的仪式中，无辜的年轻女性被欺骗或强迫食用所爱之人的肉。其他人在祈祷治愈垂危的亲人后，却得到了残忍的答复而成为了女狂热者。创造女狂热者的一种特别残忍的方法是迷惑受害者，强迫她用茴香棍将所爱之人打死。最温和的转变方法是作为对他人罪行的惩罚——当所爱之人拒绝崇拜疯狂或快乐之神时。",
	"Despite being fey creatures themselves, maenads are largely reviled by other fey due to the taint of mortality they carry. Maenads also frequently succeed in wooing satyrs away from less debauched fey lovers by pandering to their penchant for hedonism.

Maenads are especially abhorrent to non-evil fey due to the depraved and gruesome rituals that create them.": "尽管自身是精灵生物，但由于携带着死亡气息，玛奈德（maenads）在其他精灵中广受厌恶。玛奈德经常成功地诱使半人马（satyrs）远离不那么放荡的精灵恋人，满足他们对享乐主义的偏好。这些结合导致产生了怪物化的羊人后代，他们像他们的母亲一样不受欢迎，因为他们相对脆弱且与凡人有联系。玛奈德对非邪恶精灵尤其令人憎恶，因为创造它们的堕落和可怕仪式。",
	"Maenads embody all-consuming hedonism and have little patience for anything else. They are absolutely dedicated to the pursuit of pleasure in all its forms, including sadistic bacchanals of wild excess.

Clever individuals who find themselves confronted by maenads may be able to use their individual tastes to turn the creatures against each other. That might allow for an escape. Otherwise, the maenads will gleefully tear apart hapless trespassers.": "狂欢女神(Maenads)体现了无尽的享乐主义，对其他事物几乎没有耐心。她们绝对致力于追求各种形式的快乐，包括野蛮过度的残忍狂欢。虽然渴望参与任何类型的狂欢，但一些狂欢女神可能有偏爱的放纵，比如食物或酒。聪明的个体若发现自己面对狂欢女神，也许可以利用她们的个人喜好来让这些生物相互对抗。这样或许可以逃脱。否则，狂欢女神将欣然撕裂那些不幸的闯入者。",
	"There are legends that speak of an undead creature so vile that even saying its name has the power to summon its stench.

	"The nuckle is one of the most horrific undead abominations to terrorize the mortal realm. From a distance, the nuckle resembles a human rider upon a horse. Closer inspection, however, reveals a creature that could not possibly be mistaken as such. The nuckle resembles a rotting corpse with its humanoid lower torso fused to the back of an equine form that makes up the majority of the creature's body. A single oversized eye stares out from the center of the nuckle's bulbous head, and it grasps at its victims with clawed hands attached to spindly, too-long arms.

Although the sea is the creature's true home, the nuckle regularly rises from the depths to plague coastal cities and towns, bringing death and misfortune in its wake. A nuckle's preferred manner of attack is to grab a victim and drag them into the sea on its back in a manner that makes the victim appear to be riding into the water on horseback. The nuckle may disappear beneath the waves for years at a time, only to rise and wreak havoc during a months-long rampage.": "据说，死亡女神卢瑟里亚（Lutheria）创造了纳克尔（nuckle），其唯一目的是降临文明世界并折磨居民。尽管海洋是这种生物的真正家园，纳克尔经常从深海中升起，困扰沿海城市和小镇，带来死亡和不幸。纳克尔偏爱的攻击方式是抓住受害者并将其拖入海中，使受害者看起来像是骑马进入水中。纳克尔可能会在海浪下消失数年，然后在数月的暴行期间再次出现并肆虐。",
	"Black poison pumps through a nuckle's veins, which pours out of its slit-like nostrils in the form of noxious fumes. This toxic cloud threatens all forms of life, wilting crops and sickening livestock. Animals that survive the nuckle's poisonous breath are often driven mad and compelled to dash themselves upon rocky cliffs or drown themselves in the sea.": "一种黑色毒液流淌在一只（Nuckle）的血管中，从它的裂缝般的鼻孔中喷出有毒烟雾。这种有毒的云团威胁着所有形式的生命，使庄稼枯萎，牲畜生病。幸存于（Nuckle）的毒气之下的动物通常会被逼疯，自己冲向崎岖的悬崖或者投向海中淹死。",
	"As formidable as the nuckle is, the monster does have its weaknesses. Chief among these is large amounts of pure fresh water. If the nuckle is drenched with enough fresh water, its body swells up and bursts, destroying the creature. To protect itself, the nuckle uses its magic to cause devastating droughts. However, this ability weakens the farther it strays from the sea. Brave heroes wishing to vanquish a nuckle often lure it as far inland as possible by burning seaweed. The stench of the resulting smoke has the power to enrage the nuckle to the point where it abandons all sense of self-preservation, as it is driven to find the source. Strong caution should be taken when using this strategy, however, as it is prone to backfiring; the nuckle destroys any settlements unfortunate enough to exist between it and the target of its fury.": "尽管(``nuckle``)强大，但这种怪物确实有它的弱点。其中最主要的是大量纯净淡水。如果(``nuckle``)被足够的淡水浸湿，它的身体会膨胀然后爆裂，摧毁这个生物。为了保护自己，(``nuckle``)使用它的魔法引发毁灭性的干旱。然而，这种能力在它远离海洋时会变弱。希望消灭(``nuckle``)的勇敢英雄通常会通过燃烧海藻来诱使它尽可能远离海岸。由此产生的烟雾气味会激怒(``nuckle``)，使它放弃一切自我保护意识，被驱使着寻找源头。然而，在使用这种策略时应格外小心，因为它很容易适得其反；(``nuckle``)会摧毁任何不幸存在在它和愤怒目标之间的定居点。",
	"As the name implies, lesser sphinxes are less powerful than their cousins, the better-known gynosphinxes and androsphinxes. Rather than having a humanoid head like greater sphinxes, hierocosphinxes resemble birds of prey, while criosphinxes possess features that resemble horned sheep. Despite their animal visages, lesser sphinxes are eloquent and wise. Some scholars speculate that it is possible for a lesser sphinx to change into gynosphinx or an androsphinx over time.": "正如其名，次级狮身人面兽比它们的表亲——更为人所熟知的雌狮身人面兽和雄狮身人面兽——要弱大一些。与大狮身人面兽不同，神圣狮身人面兽的头部更像猛禽，而公羊狮身人面兽则具有类似有角羊的特征。尽管它们有动物的外貌，次级狮身人面兽却善辩且睿智。一些学者推测，次级狮身人面兽有可能随着时间的推移变成雌狮身人面兽或雄狮身人面兽。",
	"Lesser sphinxes often serve greater sphinxes, forming a small pride led by a greater sphinx or a designated lieutenant. However, instead of guarding a location alongside their gynosphinx or androsphinx master, lesser sphinxes are given the task of protecting a separate area. Usually nearby, these auxiliary locations lie along the path to the primary place of stewardship. They provide additional challenges to supplicants in search of the greater sphinxes. Although lesser sphinxes are bound to guard a particular location like their greater counterparts, they do not have access to lair actions. However, lesser sphinxes are able to utilize their connections to the primordial powers of time in their own ways.": "次级狮身人面兽经常侍奉着更高级的狮身人面兽，组成一个由更高级狮身人面兽或指定的副官领导的小群体。然而，与他们的雌性狮身人面兽或雄性狮身人面兽主人一起守护一个地点不同，次级狮身人面兽被赋予保护另一个区域的任务。通常位于附近，这些辅助地点沿着通往主要管理地点的路径。它们为寻找更高级狮身人面兽的恳求者提供额外的挑战。虽然次级狮身人面兽像他们更高级的同类一样被绑定守护特定地点，但他们无法使用巢穴行动。然而，次级狮身人面兽能够以自己的方式利用他们与时间原始力量的联系。",
	"Like greater sphinxes, some lesser sphinxes eventually grow weary of their responsibilities as guardians and break away from their divine command. Unlike androsphinxes and gynosphinxes, lesser sphinxes can wander far away from their former dens, finding new places for themselves in the world at large. Such cases are very rare, but unbound sphinxes have been known to found and lead humanoid groups.": "就像更大的狮身人面兽一样，一些较小的狮身人面兽最终厌倦了作为守护者的责任，并违背了神圣的命令。与雄性狮身人面兽和雌性狮身人面兽不同，较小的狮身人面兽可以远离他们以前的巢穴，发现世界各地的新地方。这样的情况非常罕见，但已知有些未受约束的狮身人面兽建立并领导人形生物团体。",
	"The lesser sphinxes have powers that interact with their ability to mark time. This time marking only works if detailed notes are kept by the Game Master. When a sphinx uses {@italic time mark}, make sure to write down hit points, effects, and positions of all of the creatures impacted.": "次级狮身人面兽拥有与他们标记时间能力相互作用的力量。只有游戏主持人保留详细记录，这种时间标记才能起作用。当一只狮身人面兽使用{@italic time mark}时，请务必记下受影响的所有生物的生命值、效果和位置。",
	"These ram-headed sphinxes are the most likely of their kind to abandon neutrality and are sometimes of lawful good alignment, in contrast to their somewhat fiendish appearance. Associated with love and vigor, criosphinxes represent the sanguine side of creatures otherwise known for their phlegmatic attitudes.": "这些羊头斯芬克斯是最有可能放弃中立立场的一种，有时候会是（(Lawful Good)）的，与它们略带邪恶的外表形成鲜明对比。与爱和活力相关联，克利奥斯芬克斯代表了那些以痰质态度著称的生物的多血性一面。",
	"Although less likely than hierocosphinxes to ignore divine commands, those unbound criosphinxes that do exist are more likely to interact with human society. Such criosphinxes are often attracted to serve human royalty or take on the mantle of leadership themselves. Many monuments and statues of sphinxes from antiquity may actually depict criosphinxes rather than the gynosphinxes they more resemble, with ancient artisans attempting to \"humanize\" these great figures for future generations.": "尽管相对于忽视神圣命令的人面狮身兽(hierocosphinxes)来说，那些未受约束的公羊狮身兽(criosphinxes)更有可能与人类社会互动。这样的公羊狮身兽通常被吸引为人类皇室服务或者自己担任领导职务。许多古代的狮身兽纪念碑和雕像实际上可能描绘的是公羊狮身兽，而不是更类似的雌狮身兽(gynosphinxes)，古代艺术家试图为后代“人性化”这些伟大的形象。",
	"Where criosphinxes embody the sanguine or optimistic aspect of the sphinx, the hawk-headed hierocosphinx tends toward the choleric or plain bad tempered. Many of these creatures are lawful evil in alignment and created to serve the commands of evil deities. Unbound hierocosphinxes usually choose a life of angry solitude, though some become great tyrants over lesser creatures.": "在狮身人面兽体现出了狮身人面兽的乐观或乐观的一面时，鹰首圣兽则倾向于易怒或脾气暴躁。这些生物中许多都是守序邪恶的，被创造出来是为了服侍邪恶神明的命令。未被束缚的鹰首圣兽通常选择过着愤怒的孤独生活，尽管有些会成为较低等生物的暴君。",
	"While a criosphinx presents adventurers with exacting challenges out of pride and devotion to its master, the hierocosphinx may deny a supplicant their due reward—even if they have completed its task—out of pure spite. The hierocosphinx justifies its actions in such cases by pedantry: any deviation from doing the task exactly as explained will allow the hierocosphinx to declare it a failure.": "当一只公羊狮身人面兽(criosphinx)出于骄傲和对主人的忠诚向冒险者提出严格的挑战时，神圣狮身人面兽(hierocosphinx)可能会出于纯粹的恶意而拒绝给予请求者应得的奖励，即使他们已经完成了任务。在这种情况下，神圣狮身人面兽通过迂腐的辩解来为自己的行为辩护：任何偏离任务要求的行为都会让神圣狮身人面兽宣布任务失败。",
	"Sometimes mistaken for griffons, hierocosphinxes are easily distinguished by their leonine manes and forelegs. The intelligence of griffons and hierocosphinxes is a stark contrast between the two: griffons are unintelligent, while hierocosphinxes are fully sapient beings mentally similar to humans. Even though they are different, griffons and hierocosphinxes have been known to interbreed. Any offspring possess a random patchwork of feline and avian features, and rarely show any hierocosphinx intelligence.": "有时被误认为是狮鹫，但狮鹫狮身人面兽的特征很容易区分出来，它们有着狮子般的鬃毛和前腿。狮鹫和狮鹫狮身人面兽之间的智力差异是明显的：狮鹫并不聪明，而狮鹫狮身人面兽则是完全类似于人类的智慧生物。尽管它们有所不同，狮鹫和狮鹫狮身人面兽已知会发生杂交。任何后代都会拥有随机的猫科动物和鸟类特征，很少展现出狮鹫狮身人面兽的智慧。",

	"Thylean soldiers are usually called \"hoplites,\" and they specialize in a mass military formation called the \"phalanx.\" Soldiers typically arrange themselves into tight rows on the battlefield, locking their shields together to create a shield wall. Hoplites on the front line carry their shield on their left arm, protecting their neighbor to the left. They use their right hand to reach over the shield wall and attack the enemy with their spear.": "泰利亚士兵通常被称为“重装步兵”，他们擅长一种被称为“方阵”的大规模军事编队。士兵们通常在战场上排成紧密的行列，将他们的盾牌锁在一起，形成一个盾墙。在前线的重装步兵用左臂扛着盾牌，保护左侧的战友。他们用右手伸过盾墙袭击敌人，手持长矛。",
	"This formation was devised for use in large-scale battles, but in Thylea, even small squadrons of soldiersare trained to take advantage of the phalanx. With the leadership of a captain, pairs of soldiers can lock their shields together into tight units, dramatically increasing their effectiveness.": "这种编队是为了在大规模战斗中使用而设计的，但在蒂莱亚，即使是小股士兵队伍也接受训练，以利用方阵的优势。在一个队长的领导下，士兵们可以成对将他们的盾牌紧密地锁在一起，大大提高他们的效率。",
	"Armies are organized into detachments of soldiers that need commanders. A captain must have the respect of his unit, even if this is only because he is far tougher than his followers. He must also have the combat skill and willingness to lead from the front. A wise captain also keeps his men alive by not committing them to battles without a solid chance of victory.": "军队被组织成士兵的分遣队，这些队需要指挥官。一个队长必须得到他的部队尊重，即使这只是因为他比他的追随者更强壮。他还必须具备战斗技能和愿意率先领导的意愿。一个明智的队长还通过不让他的士兵参加没有确实获胜机会的战斗来保持他的士兵的生命。",
	"Some troglodytes are born bigger than others of their kind.

	"The Aresians are unimpressed by the phalanx techniques that we introduced during the First War. They've developed their own fighting styles, which emphasize fluidity and grace.

	"Kyrah seeks to atone for the sins of Estor Arkelander by doing as much good as possible. She is full of optimistic energy, and she refuses to stand by when even the slightest injustices go uncorrected and unpunished. Kyrah detests sitting still, and her eagerness for a good story makes her a bit reckless. She will sometimes goad mortals into dangerous acts of heroism, hoping for dramatic material that she can use.": "凯拉（Kyrah）寻求通过尽可能多地做好事来赎罪埃斯托·阿克兰德（Estor Arkelander）的罪孽。她充满乐观的能量，拒绝袖手旁观，即使是最轻微的不公正也不会被纠正和惩罚。凯拉讨厌静止不动，她对一个好故事的渴望使她有点鲁莽。她有时会煽动凡人进行危险的英雄行为，希望获得她可以利用的戏剧性素材。",
	"However, she never acts maliciously, and she is careful to study prophecies; she doesn't make unreasonable demands. Kyrah loves to play tricks, large and small.

She is especially fond of playing pranks on humorless tyrants and petty bullies, such as King Acastus of Mytros.": "然而，她从不恶意行事，并且她很注意研究预言；她不会提出不合理的要求。Kyrah喜欢玩各种大小的恶作剧。因此，很少有人崇拜她，但几乎每个人都相信她。当东西失踪时，或者物品突然无故出现时，她经常被“归功于”。她特别喜欢捉弄那些不幽默的暴君和小人物，比如Mytros的国王Acastus。",
	"Vallus is extraordinarily perceptive, often to the point where she is suspected of mindreading. She always seems to discern truth, even when she is told a clever lie. A hard stare from Vallus is often enough to make even the most skilled liars concede the truth. Vallus has lost much of her faith in the future of Thylea. Although she endeavors to protect the Temple of the Five in Mytros, she has witnessed too much of Thylean history to believe that the Oracle's prophecy will result in anything but total disaster.": "瓦卢斯（Vallus）极其敏锐，常常让人怀疑她会读心术。她似乎总能辨别真相，即使被告知一个巧妙的谎言。瓦卢斯的坚定凝视常常足以让即使是最熟练的说谎者也承认真相。瓦卢斯对泰利亚（Thylea）的未来失去了很多信心。尽管她努力保护着迈特洛斯（Mytros）的五座神殿，但她见证了太多泰利亚历史，无法相信神谕的预言不会导致彻底的灾难。",
	"Vallus's true form is a young bronze dragon, who previously served as a mount for Telamok Arkelander.

She is not wracked with the same second-hand guilt that plagues Kyrah.": "瓦卢斯的真实形态是一只年轻的青铜龙，曾经作为泰拉莫克·阿克兰德的坐骑。虽然泰拉莫克犯下的暴行几乎和他的兄弟埃斯托一样多，但瓦卢斯明白这是在泰莱亚定居的代价之一。她没有像凯拉那样被同样的间接罪恶感折磨。",
	"Narsus is revered in the city of Aresia as the God of Beauty. He is egotistical, lazy, and arrogant, as well as selfish, and obsessed with the beauty that he attained when he was transformed from a dragon into a god.

The other gods disowned him for this, driving him to seek an easy life among mortals.": "纳尔苏斯(Narsus)在阿瑞西亚(Aresia)城被尊为美之神。他自负、懒惰、傲慢，自私且痴迷于他从龙变成神时所获得的美貌。很久以前，他拒绝在第一次战争期间帮助他们而抛弃了他的兄弟姐妹，后者将组成五大神祇的全体。其他神祇因此与他决裂，迫使他寻求在凡人中过上轻松的生活。",

	"Most contenders gave up the hunt after the first year, but the oread huntress, Ekoh, was obsessed with Narsus. She spent years searching for the stag and finally killed it.

Queen Calliope of Aresia had seduced Narsus, luring him away to Aresia, where he's been kept for the past 500 years.": "大多数竞争者在第一年放弃了猎物，但奥瑞亚德女猎手艾科（Ekoh）却对纳尔苏斯（Narsus）着迷。她花了多年时间寻找这只雄鹿，最终将其杀死。她得意洋洋地回到迈特洛斯（Mytros），想要嫁给这位神明，但她来晚了。阿瑞西亚（Aresia）的卡丽奥佩女王（Queen Calliope）勾引了纳尔苏斯，将他带到了阿瑞西亚，他在那里被囚禁了500年。",

But the woman would not be deterred.": "数千年前，一名女子来到蒂莱亚（Thylea）寻找她的财富。当那片土地的生物问她来自何方时，她只会说：“我来自蛇发女妖之地（the land of the Gorgons）。”那时的蒂莱亚虽然自然风光丰富，但财富贫乏。但这位女子并不会被阻挠。",
	"Dwarves have strong, prominent features. Field dwarves have skin tanned and weathered by many years of sun and soil in the fields. Volcano dwarves have a slightly lighter complexion due to their lives spend toiling under the mountains. While field dwarves tend to dress simply, volcano dwarves take deep pride in their appearance. Their hair and beards, black or reddish brown, is worn in matted locks. They cap these coils in heavy beads of gold, bronze, or mountain glass. They trade with humans for royal colors of cloth and adorn themselves with thick rings and armbands, set with wide stones.": "矮人有着强壮而显著的特征。田野矮人的皮肤被多年的阳光和土地打磨得古铜色。火山矮人因为长期在山下辛勤劳作，所以肤色略微较浅。田野矮人通常穿着朴素，而火山矮人则非常注重自己的外表。他们的黑色或红褐色头发和胡须盘成一团。他们在这些卷发上戴着厚重的金、青铜或山晶珠饰。他们与人类交易以获取皇家色彩的布料，并佩戴镶有宽大宝石的厚戒指和臂环。",
	"First, the woman searched the steppes and mountains, and she came to the centaurs, asking, \"Where may I find gems and jewels to rival the stars?\" The centaurs offered her a shank of lamb and said, \"Why seek gems and jewels when the stars are free to everyone?\" Disappointed, she cast away the food and left the centaurs to their star-gazing.": "首先，这位女士在草原和山脉中搜索，她来到半人马族，问道：“我在哪里可以找到能与星星匹敌的宝石和珠宝？”半人马族给了她一块羊腿，说道：“当星星对每个人都是免费的时候，为什么要寻找宝石和珠宝呢？” 失望之下，她扔掉食物离开了半人马族，让他们继续凝视星空。",
	"Then the woman searched the forests, and she came to the satyrs, asking, \"Where may I find rivers of gold and silver that flow like fountains?\" The satyrs offered her a goblet of wine and said, \"Gold and silver make a very poor feast. Wouldn't you rather join us for a song and a drink?\" Disappointed again, the woman cast away the goblet and left the satyrs to their revelry.": "然后这位女士在森林中搜索，她来到了半人半兽（satyrs），问道：“我该去哪里找到像喷泉一样流淌的金银之河？” 半人半兽们递给她一只酒杯，说道：“金银只能当一顿很差的大餐。你不想和我们一起唱歌喝一杯吗？” 女士再次失望，扔掉了酒杯，离开了半人半兽们的狂欢。",
	"Now, the woman wandered high and low, seeking her fortune to no avail, and finally she came upon three women weaving at a loom. She said, \"I wish for riches beyond the imagination of all the creatures that haunt this accursed land.\" The three women, who were the Fates, warned her. \"Is this truly what you desire? You may have it, but the price will be high.\" And the woman answered, \"When I am rich, I shall have no trouble paying any price.\" And the Fates said, \"So be it.\"": "现在，这位女子四处游荡，寻找她的财富，但毫无结果，最后她来到一个织布机前，看到三位女子正在织布。她说，“我希望拥有超乎这片被诅咒之地所有生物想象的财富。” 这三位女子，即命运女神，警告她。“这真的是你所渴望的吗？你可以得到，但代价将会很高。” 女子回答道，“当我富有时，我将毫无困难地支付任何代价。” 命运女神说，“那就这样吧。”",
	"The woman's eyes suddenly gleamed like golden coins, and wherever she turned her gaze, creatures were turned to stone. \"So that none may rob you of your treasure,\" said the Fates. The woman's hair grew long and sinuous, slithering and scaled like snakes. \"So that always you will have the company of hearts as cold as your own.\" And finally, the woman's hands were filled with gems and coins that were beautiful beyond the reckoning of stars or songs. Her name was Medusa, and she was the namesake of her curse, which afflicts many such mortals with more ambition than sense.": "这位女人的眼睛突然闪耀着像金币一样的金色光芒，无论她的目光所及之处，生物都会变成石头。“为了让没有人能夺走你的宝藏，”命运三女神说道。这位女人的头发变得又长又柔软，如同蛇一般蜿蜒滑动，鳞片闪闪发光。“这样你将永远拥有与你一样冷漠的心灵为伴。”最后，这位女人的双手满是美丽到超越星辰或歌曲的宝石和金币。她的名字是美杜莎(Medusa)，她的名字成为了她的诅咒，这个诅咒影响着许多比理智更多的凡人。",
	"Medusae have typically made bargains with some sort of fiend or fiendish power, but in some cases, they are oathbreakers who have displeased the gods or the Fates. Either way, they have been afflicted with the curse of the medusa as punishment, and recovery from the curse is not possible without the use of powerful magic. In some cases, even the {@spell greater restoration|PHB} spell may not be enough to break the curse. But in many other cases, the medusa simply embraces the curse as part of her identity. Children born to medusae are also affected by the curse.": "水母通常与某种恶魔或邪恶力量达成了交易，但在某些情况下，她们是背弃誓约的人，得罪了众神或命运。无论哪种情况，她们都因为惩罚而被诅咒成为美杜莎，而要摆脱这个诅咒则需要强大的魔法。在某些情况下，即使是{@spell greater restoration|PHB}法术也可能无法打破诅咒。但在许多其他情况下，美杜莎只是接受诅咒作为自己身份的一部分。出生在美杜莎身边的孩子也会受到这个诅咒的影响。",
	"Medusae are known to spend much of their time plotting against those who rival them in wealth, power, or beauty. Some medusae name their snakes and speak to them as if they were speaking to cherished pets or loved ones. Others are ashamed of their curse and seek to break it. Medusae must train themselves to never gaze into a mirror or stare at their reflection, for in an ironic twist of fate, they are vulnerable to their own petrifying gaze.": "水母们以策划对抗那些在财富、权力或美貌上与自己匹敌的人而闻名。一些水母会给她们的蛇取名，并对它们说话，就像在与珍爱的宠物或亲人交谈一样。另一些水母为自己的诅咒感到羞耻，并试图摆脱它。水母们必须训练自己永远不要凝视镜子或看着自己的倒影，因为在一个讽刺的命运转折中，她们对自己的石化凝视也是脆弱的。",
	"I will never understand how the people of Mytros can consider themselves to be so enlightened when they treat the minotaur tribes like cattle. Travel widely enough and you will come to know shopkeepers, poets, and philosophers with the faces of bulls. True, there are some who are monsters. But is that not also true of men?": "我永远无法理解米特洛斯（Mytros）的人民如何能认为自己是如此开明，却将米诺陶（minotaur）部落视为牲畜。如果你旅行得足够广泛，你会发现有着牛脸的店主、诗人和哲学家。当然，有些是怪物。但这对人类来说难道也不是事实吗？",
	"Minotaurs are the descendants of an ancient tribe of humans who were cursed by the gods, transforming them into half-human, half-bull monstrosities. Although they are widely dismissed as unthinking brutes, they are in fact as diverse and as intelligent as any other race.": "牛头人是一个古老人类部落的后裔，被诸神诅咒，使他们变成了半人半牛的怪物。尽管他们经常被认为是没有思考能力的野兽，但实际上他们和其他种族一样多样化且聪明。",
	"Over a thousand years ago, a tribe of humans washed ashore in Thylea and came to live in the southern hills of the Aresian peninsula. Here, they laid foundations for a city and called it Minos. But not one man or woman among them had the strength to till the hard, rocky soil. As fate would have it, they discovered a magnificent bull that could pull a plow through any terrain for days without resting. Using the bull's great strength, they were able to produce bountiful crops with which to survive the first winter.": "一千多年前，一支人类部落漂洋过海来到泰莱亚，并定居在阿瑞西亚半岛的南部山区。在这里，他们奠定了一座城市的基础，并称之为米诺斯(Minos)。然而，他们中没有一个人有力量去耕种那坚硬、多石的土地。命运注定，他们发现了一头壮丽的公牛，能够在任何地形中连续数日不休息地拉着犁耕地。借助这头公牛的巨大力量，他们得以生产出丰盛的庄稼，度过了第一个冬天。",
	"Over time, the people of the tribe began to venerate the bull, crowning him as the god of the harvest. When Sydon learned of this, he was furious. He threw curses down upon the settlers and transformed them into bulls, in mockery of their insolence. Each of them was harnessed to a plow and forced to tread the same winding, geometric path, until that path became a deep, labyrinthian gorge. Eventually, the plows broke, and the people of Minos slowly began to stand upright again—but their faces had been forever changed by the curse.": "随着时间的推移，部落的人们开始崇拜公牛，将其加冕为丰收之神。当赛登(Sydon)得知此事时，他勃然大怒。他向定居者施下诅咒，将他们变成了公牛，以嘲讽他们的傲慢。每个人都被套上犁具，被迫踏上相同蜿蜒、几何的路径，直到那条路径变成了一个深邃的、错综复杂的峡谷。最终，犁具损坏了，米诺斯(Minos)的人们慢慢地重新站了起来—但他们的面容却永远被诅咒改变了。",
	"The people of the tribe came to be called minotaurs—the bulls of Minos—and they have never fully shed their bull-like demeanors. Some of them merely have horns and a snout-like nose, while others have the entire upper torso of a bull. Some continued to dwell in the labyrinth, while others left to explore the far reaches of Thylea. Over the centuries, they have come to view their own cursed existence as the will of the Fates.": "部落的人被称为米诺陶斯人—米诺斯的公牛—他们从未完全摆脱牛的举止。有些人只长着角和类似鼻子的口吻，而另一些人则拥有整个牛的上半身。有些人继续居住在迷宫中，而另一些人则离开探索泰莱亚的边远地区。几个世纪以来，他们开始将自己被诅咒的存在视为命运的旨意。",
	"Minotaurs possess uncommon strength, making them excellent warriors. The curse infuses their bodies with the power of a bull at all times, and their muscles seldom relax, even when they are drunk or asleep. In battle, minotaurs sometimes lose control of their emotions and fly into a rage. When this happens, the curse takes over, transforming them back into a full-fledged bull for a short period of time.": "牛头人拥有非凡的力量，使它们成为出色的战士。这个诅咒让它们的身体时刻充满着公牛的力量，即使在喝醉或睡觉时，它们的肌肉也很少放松。在战斗中，牛头人有时会失去对情绪的控制，陷入狂怒之中。当这种情况发生时，诅咒会接管他们的身体，将它们短暂地变回一头完整的公牛。",
	"Minotaurs are widely shunned, because they are believed to be unthinking brutes who have been cursed by the gods. Most minotaurs gather together to form small farming or fishing communities, far from civilization. The only way that most minotaurs can find work in cities and villages is to swear oaths of service that effectively reduce them to the status of slaves. Many bear this humiliation with stoic grit, but others resort to banditry rather than submit to the unreasonable demands of cowardly superstition.": "因为人们相信它们是被诸神诅咒的没有思考能力的蛮兽，所以牛头人广受排斥。大多数牛头人会聚集在一起，组成小农场或渔村社区，远离文明社会。大多数牛头人要想在城市和村庄找到工作的唯一途径就是发誓效忠，实际上将他们降为奴隶的地位。许多人默默忍受这种羞辱，但也有些人宁愿诈为强盗，也不愿屈服于懦弱迷信的不合理要求。",
	"Minotaurs generally prefer names that are short and simple. They typically punctuate their names with a snort or a sharp exhalation of air through their nostrils. When someone omits this part of their name, they become annoyed.": "牛头人通常喜欢简短而简单的名字。他们通常会在名字中加入一个哼声或者通过鼻孔发出的尖锐呼气声。当有人忽略他们名字中的这一部分时，他们会感到恼火。",

	"I once loved a man who had eyes like jewels, and tresses like the sun, and lips like a flower. He claimed to have been born within a crag at the peak of the mountain near my village, but I did not believe him, for how could anything so delicate be born from hard, pitted rock?": "我曾经爱过一个男人，他的眼睛像宝石，发丝如太阳，嘴唇如花。他声称自己出生在我村庄附近山顶的悬崖中，但我不相信他，因为怎么可能有如此娇嫩的东西从坚硬、凹凸不平的岩石中诞生呢？",
	"Nymphs are fey spirits that manifest from the beauty of the elemental forces of creation. There are many kinds of nymphs—dryads of the forests, naiads of the rivers, oreads of the mountains, aurae of the night sky, and nereids of the sea. They have walked the earth for millennia, ever since the Great Mother awakened them from the trees, waters, rocks, and breezes.": "仙灵是从创世元素力量的美中显现出来的精灵。有许多种类的仙灵——森林的树精、河流的水仙、山脉的岩精、夜空的气精，以及海洋的海妖。自从伟大母亲将它们从树木、水域、岩石和微风中唤醒以来，它们已经在地球上行走了几千年。",
	"Nymphs are most at home in nature, but they have been known to disguise themselves and live amongst mortals, for they are desperately curious about the civilized world. In spite of this, they often have a difficult time comprehending the day-to-day struggle of civilized existence. Their charms are such that they may inadvertently seduce and domesticate mortal 'pets' who see to their every need, leaving them somewhat puzzled by the ugliness and hardship that seems to pervade cities.": "仙女们最适应自然环境，但据说她们会伪装自己，生活在凡人之间，因为她们对文明世界充满好奇。尽管如此，她们常常难以理解文明生活中的日常挣扎。她们的魅力是如此之大，以至于可能会无意中诱惑和驯化那些视她们需求为重的凡人“宠物”，这让她们对城市中似乎普遍存在的丑陋和艰辛感到困惑。",
	"There was once a river running through the mountains. None can say which river or which mountains, for this was so long ago that the land has rolled and shifted so as to become unrecognizable in the time since. The mountains were blanketed in a soft powder of white snow, and as the snow melted, it crept along the ground and joined together into streams of water, which trickled along the rocks and formed a river. And the river coursed down through a forest, emptying into the ocean. So it went for eons.": "曾经有一条河流穿过群山。谁也说不清是哪条河流或哪座山，因为这是很久以前的事情，土地在那之后经历了翻滚和变迁，已经变得面目全非。群山被一层柔软的白雪覆盖着，当雪融化时，它沿着地面蔓延并汇聚成水流，顺着岩石滴滴答答地流淌，形成了一条河流。河流穿过一片森林，最终流入大海。如此循环往复，经过了无数个纪元。",
	"But then one day, the snow on the mountains had a thought. \"Am I alike to the water in the streams?\" And so also did the water in the river begin to wonder, \"Am I alike to the roots of the trees?\" They were curious, but it seemed that they would never know the answer, for just as the snow went to inspect the streams, it became the water, and just as the water went to inspect the trees, it became the roots. And so it went for eons.": "但是有一天，山上的雪想到了一个问题。“我是否和小溪中的水相似？”河流中的水也开始思考，“我是否和树根相似？”它们感到好奇，但似乎永远也不会知道答案，因为就在雪去检查小溪时，它变成了水，就在水去检查树时，它变成了树根。如此循环，经过了无数个世纪。",
	"Eventually, the Great Mother herself became aware of these questions. Holding the world in her embrace, she felt the curiosity of the elements rippling and vibrating across its surface, anxious for answers. And so, she loosened her grip—just slightly. The rippling thoughts of the snow and the waters and the rocks and the trees took shape, and their shapes were beautiful, for they were curiosity made manifest. These were the first nymphs.": "最终，(Great Mother)本身意识到了这些问题。她怀抱着世界，感受到元素的好奇在其表面涟漪和振动，渴望得到答案。于是，她稍稍放松了她的控制。雪、水、岩石和树木的涟漪思绪开始成形，它们的形态美丽无比，因为它们是好奇心的具现。这些就是第一批( nymphs)。",
	"Nymphs are famed for their feminine charms, but they are not exclusively female. Some are awakened from the elements with a mix of masculine and feminine features, and others are quintessential specimens of male splendor. As fey creatures, nymphs like little less than to be nailed down by the crude shackles of mortal language. They come in as many shapes and forms as the earth itself. The only physical trait that all of them have in common is an awe-inspiring beauty.": "仙灵以其女性魅力而闻名，但它们并非完全是女性。有些从元素中觉醒，具有男性和女性特征的混合体，而其他一些则是男性荣耀的典型典范。作为精灵生物，仙灵最不喜欢被凡俗语言的粗糙桎梏束缚。它们的形态和形式与地球本身一样多样。它们唯一共同的身体特征就是令人敬畏的美丽。",
	"Nymphs have an insatiable desire to learn as much as possible about both the natural and the civilized world. Because most have had eons to discover the splendor of nature, it is the civilized world that interests them the most. However, they are not usually very accustomed to mortal culture, and so they may think of men and women as interesting baubles to be collected and admired. Even civilized nymphs tend to cherish their friends and acquaintances as 'pets' to be manicured and proudly exhibited. They are not above bragging about their collection—or fighting with one another over their favorites.": "仙女们渴望尽可能多地了解自然界和文明世界。由于大多数仙女已经有了漫长的时间来发现自然的壮丽，所以他们对文明世界最感兴趣。然而，他们通常不太习惯于凡人的文化，因此他们可能会把男人和女人视为有趣的小玩意，值得收藏和欣赏。即使是文明的仙女也倾向于珍视他们的朋友和熟人，把他们当作“宠物”来修剪和自豪地展示。他们不介意炫耀自己的收藏品，甚至会为了争夺自己喜欢的人而争吵。",

Sod them all, but the damned goats play music that could make the Muse herself weep.": "相信这些长着角的恶魔会在你与他们达成的任何交易中占上风。他们会要求用酒来支付报酬，然后把你灌穷。我发现其中一个在马厩后边跟我妹妹乱搞，他竟然不觉得羞耻，反而写了一首歌。见鬼，这些该死的山羊演奏的音乐却能让缪斯女神自己都流泪。",

Their skin color ranges from dark to pale.": "半人马（Satyrs）有着山羊的下半身和精灵的上半身。它们的前额长着一对类似山羊的角。这些角可以从小尖刺到像山羊一样巨大的角。除了头发浓密外，半人马还在手臂、腿部和躯干长着毛发。一些半人马长得毛发较少，许多选择仔细地剃掉手臂和身体上的毛发。它们的头发可以是棕色、黑色、金色、红色、灰色或白色。皮肤颜色从深到浅不等。",

Bad days, on the other hand, may see her moaning and wailing and dragging her feet.": "塞壬们通常会在一天到另一天经历情绪波动，从极度的喜悦和对未来的希望，到极度的悲伤和悲观。无论塞壬的心情如何，她都会通过歌声来表达情感。在好的日子里，她可能会用欢快的旋律和声乐练习来惹恼同伴，一边展开翅膀飘来飘去。另一方面，在糟糕的日子里，她可能会呻吟、哀号，拖着沉重的步伐。",
	"The sirens once lived on a great expanse of shoals in the Cerulean Gulf, where they built a city of brilliant white limestone. Its towering spires and pillars thrust out from the rocky waters, allowing the sirens to fly or swim as they pleased. They lived here in joy, singing praises to Sydon, who governed the oceans. Sydon heard this from his throne in Praxys and scowled. \"Were they truly grateful, they would not build their towers to rival mine.\"": "警报声曾经生活在蔚蓝海湾的一片广阔浅滩上，在那里他们建造了一座由闪亮的白色石灰石构成的城市。城市中耸立的尖塔和柱子从岩石水面中伸出，让警报声可以随意飞翔或游泳。他们在这里快乐地生活着，歌颂着掌管海洋的Sydon。Sydon从他在普拉克西斯的王座上听到这些，皱起了眉头。“如果他们真的感激，他们就不会建造他们的塔楼来与我的相媲美。”",
	"When the sirens learned that Sydon was displeased, they were heartbroken. They dismantled their towers and composed new melodies—songs of repentance—which once more carried on the winds to the ears of the Titan.

	"But finding a dragon egg is no easy task either. For this reason, Dragonlords summon pseudodragon familiars and train them to seek out the perfect egg.

When an egg is finally discovered, the paladin and the pseudodragon may share an almost parental pride in the hatchling.": "但是，寻找龙蛋也并非易事。因此，龙领主们召唤伪龙使者，并训练它们寻找完美的蛋。这个过程可能需要数年时间，许多圣骑士开始将伪龙视为誓约中的伙伴。当最终发现了一个蛋时，圣骑士和伪龙可能会对幼龙感到几乎像亲生孩子一样的骄傲。",
	"Once the paladin's dragon is grown, its master becomes a true Dragonlord. But the paladin is as much a servant to the dragon as the dragon is to its master.

	"The only thing Chondrus likes more than being right is correcting other people when they're wrong. He relishes pointing out minor errors, and he makes a great show of being patient with those of \"lesser intellect\"than himself.": "Chondrus最喜欢的事情就是正确，比这更喜欢的是纠正别人的错误。他喜欢指出小错误，并且对那些“智力较低”的人表现出极大的耐心。",
	"Although less likely than hierocosphinxes to ignore divine commands, those unbound criosphinxes that do exist are more likely to interact with human society. Such criosphinxes are often attracted to serve human royalty or take on the mantle of leadership themselves. Many monuments and statues of sphinxes from antiquity may actually depict criosphinxes rather than the gynosphinxes they more resemble, with ancient artisans attempting to \"humanize\"these great figures for future generations.": "尽管与狮首翼兽(hierocosphinxes)相比，未受约束的公羊首翼兽(criosphinxes)更不太可能无视神圣的命令，但那些确实存在的公羊首翼兽更有可能与人类社会互动。这些公羊首翼兽通常被吸引为人类皇室服务，或者自己担任领导职务。许多古代的狮身人面像纪念碑和雕像实际上可能描绘的是公羊首翼兽，而不是更类似的雌性狮身人面像(gynosphinxes)，古代艺术家试图为后代“使这些伟大的形象更具人性化”。",
	"The relentless dread wolves track their prey with unerring precision. Once a dread wolf has smelled the blood of a living creature, it tirelessly pursues its quarry. Occasionally, dread wolves are used as hunting \"dogs\"by more intelligent monsters on the trail of particularly elusive human champions.": "无情的恐狼以毫不差错的精准追踪猎物。一旦恐狼嗅到了活物的血腥气味，它们就会不知疲倦地追逐猎物。偶尔，更聪明的怪物会将恐狼用作狩猎“犬”，追踪那些极难捕捉的人类英雄。(dread wolf)",
	"Although most dread wolves have been fashioned from the corpses of ordinary wolves, humanoids are occasionally selected to transform into these creatures upon death. Those so chosen are invariably evil and were often werewolves or prolific murderers—or both—in life. Ever a cruel goddess, Lutheria has been known to bestow this \"gift\"to her worshippers.": "尽管大多数可怕狼是由普通狼的尸体制成的，偶尔也会选择人形生物在死后变身为这些生物。被选中的人通常是邪恶的，生前往往是狼人或杀人狂，有时两者兼具。作为一位残忍的女神，卢瑟莉亚(Lutheria)已知会将这种“礼物”赐予她的信徒。",
	"Despite this grotesque bodily transformation, the euryale's face continues to be eternally young and beautiful, if somewhat unsettling. This ensures that the terms of the pact or \"boon\"that created the original medusa remains unbroken.": "尽管发生了这种怪诞的身体变化，尤里亚莉的脸仍然保持着永远年轻和美丽，尽管有些令人不安。这确保了创造原始美杜莎的契约或“恩赐”的条款保持完整。",
	"Although gigantes form social groups, these bands can hardly be called a \"community.\"Each loosely structured group is held together by two or three gigantes witches that claim to draw power from their sleeping god, Hergeron. Gigantes usually dwell in crudely built forts, often constructed in deep forests or high mountains. In Thylea, the most powerful gigantes tribes have been drawn to the lands surrounding the city of Aresia, making travel to and from the city an often deadly task.": "尽管巨人形成社会团体，但这些团体很难被称为“社区”。每个松散结构的团体都由两三位自称从他们的沉睡之神赫格隆（Hergeron）那里汲取力量的巨人女巫所维系。巨人通常居住在粗糙建造的堡垒中，这些堡垒经常建在深林或高山中。在泰勒亚（Thylea），最强大的巨人部落被吸引到了环绕着阿瑞西亚（Aresia）城市的土地上，使得前往和离开这座城市成为一项常常致命的任务。",
	"Goatlings are fond of employing irony and twisted humor when setting their deadly traps. One common tactic of goatling tricksters is to use the cries of a human infant as a lure, though the \"infant\"is really a polymorphed compatriot. Sometimes the transformed goatling remains disguised during the tribe's attack, but the goatlings particularly enjoy the reveal of having the infant show its true form just as a mortal victim succumbs to their cruel attacks.": "山羊灵在设置致命陷阱时喜欢使用讽刺和扭曲的幽默。山羊灵恶作剧者常用的一种策略是利用人类婴儿的哭声作为诱饵，尽管这个“婴儿”实际上是一个变形的同伴。有时，变形的山羊灵在部落袭击中保持伪装，但山羊灵特别喜欢在一个凡人受到他们残忍攻击时，让这个“婴儿”展示真实形态的揭示。",
	"The most obviously \"celestial\"of the mythic beasts, the golden ram can traverse any terrain and can even run through the sky itself. They also possess innate healing magic and are said to be able to raise the dead. Like the golden lion's fur, the ram's brilliant golden fleece is a much sought-after component for magic items. Unlike the lion, however, the ram can be shorn, so it is not necessary to kill a golden ram to obtain its fleece. Instead, adventurers may choose to bargain with a golden ram or convince it of their great and worthy need for its fleece.": "在神话生物中，金色公羊是最明显具有“天上”特质的，它能穿越任何地形，甚至能在天空中奔跑。它们还拥有天生的治愈魔法，据说能够使死者复活。像金色狮子的皮毛一样，公羊闪亮的金色羊毛是制作魔法物品时备受追捧的材料。然而，与狮子不同，公羊的羊毛可以剪下来，因此并不需要杀死金色公羊才能获得其羊毛。相反，冒险者可以选择与金色公羊讨价还价，或者说服它他们对其羊毛有着巨大而值得的需求。",
	"Kyrah loves to play tricks, large and small. Consequently, few people worship her, but nearly everyone believes in her. She is often \"credited\"when things go missing, or when objects suddenly reappear without explanation. She is especially fond of playing pranks on humorless tyrants and petty bullies, such as King Acastus of Mytros.": "凯拉（Kyrah）喜欢玩各种大小的恶作剧。因此，很少有人崇拜她，但几乎每个人都相信她。当东西失踪或物品突然无故出现时，她经常被“归功于”。她特别喜欢捉弄那些不幽默的暴君和小人，比如迈特洛斯（Mytros）的国王阿卡斯托斯（King Acastus）。",
	"The so-called \"raving ones\"were once human, but they have been transformed into fey creatures to serve more powerful beings. Maenads resemble beautiful female satyrs, but they are unkempt, and their frenzied demeanor betrays their true nature. These agents of chaos now follow the gods and arch-fey of madness, lust, and pleasure. All aspects of the maenad's previous personality are replaced by mania and desire. Maenads often successfully use their allure to lead unwary travelers to their filthy dens, where they and their sisters fall upon them with murderous passion.": "所谓的“狂热者”曾经是人类，但他们已经被转化为精灵生物，为更强大的存在服务。狂热女神似乎是美丽的雌性半人马，但她们不修边幅，狂乱的举止暴露了她们真正的本性。这些混沌的代理现在追随着疯狂、欲望和快乐之神和大精灵。狂热女神以前的个性的所有方面都被狂热和欲望所取代。狂热女神经常成功地利用自己的魅力引诱不谨慎的旅行者来到她们肮脏的巢穴，她们和她们的姐妹们会用充满激情的方式袭击他们。",
	"Humans rarely become \"raving ones\"by choice. Instead, the transformation is thrust upon them by powerful chaotic entities, often in the guise of mentors or teachers. The magic used to create a maenad typically comes from a strong bond to a lover, friend, or trusted elder. In the most common ritual, innocent young women are tricked or forced into consuming the flesh of a loved one. Others have become maenads after prayers to cure a dying loved one were cruelly answered. One particularly sadistic method of creating a maenad is to charm a victim and force her to beat a loved one to death with a fennel staff. The most benign method of transformation is as a punishment for the sins of another—when a loved one refuses to worship a god of madness or pleasure.": "人类很少会自愿成为“狂热者”。相反，这种转变通常是由强大的混沌实体强加给他们的，通常伪装成导师或老师。创造一个狂热者的魔法通常来自与恋人、朋友或信任的长者之间的强烈联系。在最常见的仪式中，无辜的年轻女性被欺骗或强迫食用所爱之人的肉体。其他人在祈祷治愈垂危的亲人后，却得到了残酷的回答，从而成为了狂热者。创造一个狂热者的一种特别残忍的方法是迷惑受害者，强迫她用茴香棒将所爱之人打死。最温和的转变方法是作为对他人罪行的惩罚——当所爱之人拒绝崇拜疯狂或快乐之神时。",
	"Mythic beasts are animals that carry a divine spark. These celestial creatures are neither good nor evil and while they are not unique, mortals rarely catch a glimpse of even one mythic beast in their lifetimes. The elusive beasts make their homes in the great forests and plains of both the fey and mortal realms. They are highly intelligent creatures that have the ability to speak. There are four mythic beasts spoken of in legends: the {@creature Golden Lion|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}, the {@creature White stag|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}, the {@creature Great Boar|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}, and the {@creature Golden Ram|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}.": "神话兽是携带神圣火花的动物。这些天体生物既不善良也不邪恶，虽然它们并非独一无二，但凡人一生中很少能见到一只神话兽。这些难以捉摸的生物居住在仙境和凡间的大森林和平原中。它们是高度智慧的生物，具有说话的能力。传说中有四种神话兽：{@creature Golden Lion|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}、{@creature White stag|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}、{@creature Great Boar|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}和{@creature Golden Ram|ArcanumWorldsOdysseyoftheDragonlords}。",
	"Oceanids are shapeshifters who typically take forms that are almost physically indistinguishable from male humanoids. An oceanid rarely assumes a single guise for more than a month or two at a time, but he may revisit an identity later on.

Though they may lack \"true forms,\"oceanids sometimes also appear as creatures akin to water elementals, albeit in a closer approximation of human shape.": "海女是变形者，通常会取形成几乎与男性人类无法在外貌上区分的形态。海女很少会连续保持一个外貌超过一个月或两个月的时间，但他可能会以后再次回到这个身份。许多海女会有一些细微的特征，大多数人都不会注意到，比如眼睛太绿或者汗水闻起来太像海水。虽然他们可能缺乏“真正的形态”，海女有时也会以类似水元素生物的形态出现，尽管更接近人类的形状。",
	"As the most airy of the nymphs, in demeanor and their chosen domains, oreads are reclusive creatures associated with mountains, skies, and clouds. They are mischievous and selfish, even by fey standards, and one of their favorite pastimes is to take a mortal lover to \"paradise.\"The lover is only returned to the mortal realm a century or more later, once their families and friends are all dead and gone. This is not always deliberate on the part of the oread—they simply don't give very much thought to the consequences of their actions on the lives of the mortals they beguile.": "作为最空灵的仙女之一，在举止和所选择的领域中，山精是与山脉、天空和云彩相关的隐居生物。按照仙族的标准，她们狡猾自私，喜欢把一个凡人情人带到\"天堂\"。情人只有在一个世纪甚至更久之后才会被送回凡间，那时他们的家人和朋友都已经去世。山精这样做并非总是故意的——她们只是不太考虑自己的行为对所迷惑的凡人生活的后果。",
	"Pholon likes to party and drink mead. He's always up for drinking, singing, or wrestling, especially with \"his bros.\"He's good in a fight, but he thinks war is a real bummer.": "Pholon喜欢参加派对和喝蜜酒。他总是乐于喝酒、唱歌或摔跤，尤其是和“他的兄弟们”。他在战斗中很厉害，但他觉得战争真的很糟糕。",
	"Scylla is able to feel nothing but hunger. Had she any thoughts to communicate, Scylla would nonetheless be incapable of expressing them. She \"speaks\"only in a cacophonous chorus of mad barks and whines, which is said to drive any who hear it insane.": "斯西拉 (Scylla) 只能感受到饥饿。即使她有任何想法要传达，斯西拉也无法表达。她只能用一种疯狂的吠声和哀鸣的混乱合唱来“说话”，据说这会让任何听到的人都发疯。",
	"Scylla originates from Typhon, an island whose magical energies birth countless other hybrid abominations, including chimeras and manticores. However, Scylla is Typhon's worst \"child\"by far, both in form and the amount of damage she wreaks. Some legends claim that Scylla was once a beautiful nymph who was imprisoned on Typhon for countless years. Over time, its corruption slowly twisted her body and mind into the monstrosity she is today. By the time she was strong enough to break free of her bonds, any semblance of the nymph she was had long been replaced by hunger and madness.": "斯西拉(Scylla)源自泰芬(Typhon)，一个充满魔法能量的岛屿，诞生了无数其他混合畸形生物，包括奇美拉(chimeras)和蝎尾狮(manticores)。然而，斯西拉在形态和造成的破坏程度上都是泰芬最糟糕的“孩子”。一些传说声称，斯西拉曾经是一位美丽的仙女，被囚禁在泰芬上无数年。随着时间的推移，她的腐化慢慢扭曲了她的身心，变成了今天的怪物。当她足够强大以打破束缚时，她曾经是仙女的任何痕迹早已被饥饿和疯狂所取代。",

Aegis tells all sorts of tall tales about Thylea, most of which are of his own invention.": "在路的尽头，闪闪发光的物体看起来像是一个穿着魔法胸甲的人类尸体，相当于{@item Mariner's Breastplate|DMG|mariner's armor}。其中一只正在撕咬鲸鱼的鲨鱼移动了“尸体”，使其不再可见。如果有人游到鲸鱼尸体旁寻找尸体，他们会发现那不是尸体，而是一个名叫{@bold Aegis}(LN {@creature Veteran|MM})的老人。他声称自己已经在鲸鱼体内生活了多年。如果队伍愿意接纳他，他将与他们并肩作战。阿吉斯讲述了关于西莱亚的各种离奇故事，其中大部分都是他自己虚构的。"
