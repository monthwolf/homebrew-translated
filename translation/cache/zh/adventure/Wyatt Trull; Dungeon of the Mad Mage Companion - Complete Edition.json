	"provides details for effects that occur multiple times throughout Undermountain, such as a repeated trap or hazard, like madness or extreme heat.": "提供在地下山脉(Undermountain)中多次出现的效果的细节，比如重复出现的陷阱或危险，比如疯狂或极端高温。",
	"The {@i Companion} is predicated on one simple, but wide-reaching change to the module: that the adventurers are the unwitting contestants of Halaster's hit, transplanar game show, {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}. This theme paints Halaster as a deranged game show host obsessed with ratings, performance, and, ultimately, his murder at the hands of the adventurers on \"live TV.\" This variant is referred to as {@i Halaster's Game} and provides frequent changes to the campaign.": "这个{@i Companion}是基于对模组的一个简单但影响广泛的改变：冒险者们是哈拉斯特的跨平面热门游戏节目{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}的无意参赛者。这个主题将哈拉斯特描绘成一个疯狂的游戏节目主持人，痴迷于收视率、表现，最终在“直播节目”中被冒险者们谋杀。这个变体被称为{@i Halaster's Game}，并为战役提供频繁的变化。",
	"This chapter focuses on Halaster himself, whether you use this variant or not. You can use the tips provided here to better portray the Mad Mage—who should be heavily featured during the campaign, not left to collect dust in his tower.": "这一章主要关注哈拉斯特本人，无论您是否使用这个变体。您可以使用这里提供的建议来更好地描绘这位疯狂法师——他应该在整个冒险中扮演重要角色，而不是被遗弃在他的塔楼中。",
	"Additionally, this chapter provides an overview of Undermountain, as well as additional hazards and rules you can use throughout the campaign.": "此外，本章节提供了对(安德玛丘)的概述，以及在整个冒险中可以使用的额外危险和规则。",
	"The Mad Mage himself is easily the greatest facet of this adventure and providing him face-time is what will make WDMM memorable for your players.": "疯狂法师本人很容易成为这次冒险中最重要的亮点，给他足够的出场时间将使《疯狂法师的迷宫》对你的玩家难以忘怀。",
	"In the {@i Companion}, Halaster is rewritten as a deranged game show host whose program, {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}, is apparently broadcast across the multiverse. Every season, he selects an adventuring party as his \"contestants\" and challenges them to delve deeper into Undermountain. Those that can best the dungeon's horrors will find gold, glory, and power—and perhaps even freedom from his demented game.": "在{@i Companion}中，Halaster被改写为一个疯狂的游戏节目主持人，他的节目{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}显然在多元宇宙中播出。每个赛季，他会选择一个冒险小队作为他的“参赛者”，并挑战他们深入地下山。那些能够战胜地牢的恐怖将会找到黄金、荣耀和力量——甚至可能摆脱他疯狂游戏的自由。",
	"Halaster can speak telepathically to just about any creature in Undermountain, so long as he's aware of their presence. He uses this power to irk the contestants and other characters—or to speak directly to the \"audience\" of the show. Often, he'll screw with the contestants by including them in these messages, foreshadowing horrors to come or taunting their failures. His cryptic or hilariously vague whispers are equally insufferable and unhelpful to the party.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）可以通过心灵感应与地下城（Undermountain）中几乎任何生物交流，只要他意识到它们的存在。他利用这种能力来刺激参赛者和其他角色，或者直接与节目的“观众”交谈。通常，他会通过包括参赛者在内的这些消息来捉弄他们，预示即将发生的恐怖，或者嘲讽他们的失败。他那神秘或滑稽模棱两可的耳语对于队伍来说同样令人难以忍受且毫无帮助。",
	"Halaster views himself as something akin to a deity, and as such, has reached a point of pride that consumes many all-powerful beings. To sink down to a lesser foe's level is an insult to Halaster's ego. So, while he could very well crush enemies like the {@creature lich|MM} {@creature Ezzat|WDMM}, it's beneath him to try. Like all other near-omnipotent beings, his is a game of cat-and-mouse. His minions, or the contestants of {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}, are pawns to be moved across a chessboard.": "哈拉斯特(Halaster)视自己为类似于神明的存在，因此，他已经达到了一种自负的程度，这种自负吞噬了许多全能的存在。下降到一个较弱敌人的水平对哈拉斯特的自我是一种侮辱。因此，虽然他完全有能力粉碎像{@creature lich|MM} {@creature Ezzat|WDMM} 这样的敌人，但尝试这样做对他来说是卑微的。像所有其他几乎全能的存在一样，他的行为就像是一场猫鼠游戏。他的手下，或者{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}的参与者，只是棋盘上的棋子。",
	"Many, even his apprentices, believe that Halaster's madness is owed to the Knot in the Weave, to Undermountain. The truth is far more tragic: the Mad Mage cannot ever die—and he knows it. The ecstasy he felt after his first rebirth is now just a bitter memory, a seed that has born strange fruit. This grim reality, of weathering all eternity, shattered Halaster's mind—and in the ruins of his sanity he has found comfort in madness.": "许多人，甚至他的学徒，都认为哈拉斯特（Halaster）的疯狂是由于编织之结（the Knot in the Weave），由于安德山（Undermountain）。事实要悲剧得多：这位疯狂法师永远无法死去——而他知道这一点。在第一次重生后他感受到的狂喜如今只是一个痛苦的记忆，一个结出了奇异果实的种子。这残酷的现实，经受永恒的折磨，粉碎了哈拉斯特的心智——在他精神的废墟中，他找到了疯狂中的慰藉。",
	"The adventurers' first run-in with the Mad Mage sets the tone for the entire campaign. You can't simply hurl him at the party. Instead, allow the upper reaches of Undermountain, namely L1, to demonstrate the cruelty and insanity of its host.": "冒险者们与疯狂法师的首次冲突为整个冒险活动设定了基调。你不能简单地将他投向队伍。相反，让安德山的上层区域，即L1，展示其主人的残忍和疯狂。",
	"Neither do you just want to announce that the adventurers are contestants in some crazed game; Halaster doesn't just appear and lay out the rules or declare them as his unfortunate play-things. They merely learn that they {@i already are} and the question of \"Why us?\" should forever haunt them.": "你也不只是想宣布冒险者们是某种疯狂游戏的参赛者；Halaster不会突然出现并宣布规则或宣称他们是他不幸的玩物。他们只是得知他们{@i already are}，而“为什么是我们？”这个问题应该会永远困扰着他们。",
	"The unknown is truly the scariest thing for the human mind to comprehend; therefore, you don't want to overdo it with Halaster's appearances. Foreshadowing, such as his booming laughter or his {@spell arcane eye}, serve aplenty. For L1, you ought to do your best to steer your players towards A27, the Hidden Demiplane. This should serve as your player's first encounter with the Mad Mage. This encounter is the most important one for the first several levels of Undermountain.": "未知对人类思维来说确实是最可怕的事物；因此，你不希望过度使用哈拉斯特（Halaster）的出现。预示，比如他的响亮笑声或者他的{@spell arcane eye}，足够多了。对于L1，你应该尽力引导玩家前往A27，隐藏的半位面。这应该作为玩家与疯狂法师的第一次相遇。这次遭遇是地下山的前几级中最重要的之一。",
	"No matter how deranged Halaster has grown, he's still a person. He still has a heart—and it beats for a select few. Demonstrate Halaster's tattered humanity through these individuals. Nothing wounds him more than being scorned by someone he trusts and loves; such a wound never heals, never scabs over, but just bleeds and bleeds.": "无论哈拉斯特(Halaster)变得多么疯狂，他仍然是一个人。他仍然有一颗心—而这颗心只为少数人跳动。通过这些个体展示哈拉斯特那破碎的人性。没有什么比被自己信任和爱的人蔑视更伤害他；这样的伤口永远不会愈合，永远不会结痂，只会不断地流血。",
	"Skullport's senior mage is often visited by Halaster—for tea, of all things. Of all his attachments, \"Tas\" is the only one he does not want to show his true colors to. Her opinion alone can wound the Mad Mage. Criminals, hooligans, and adventurers risk their own doom by threatening her. When together, the two act like an old married couple. See Skullport, Area 27 for details on Tas.": "骷髅港的资深法师经常受到哈拉斯特的拜访——居然是为了喝茶。在他所有的交往中，“Tas”是唯一一个他不想展示真实面目的人。她的看法可以伤害这位疯狂法师。罪犯、流氓和冒险家们冒着自己的命运危险来威胁她。当他们在一起时，这两人就像一对老夫老妻。有关Tas的详细信息，请参阅骷髅港，第27区。",
	"Halaster has quite the complicated history with the {@creature archdruid|VGM} of L5. Some part friend and some part daughter, the Mad Mage cherishes her. He cannot imagine a future without her in his dungeon—and so he'll never let her go. For her part, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} is conflicted; given all he's done for her and {@i to} her, she can't simply hate Halaster. Undermountain is both her home and her prison—just as it is for him.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）与L5的{@creature archdruid|VGM}有着相当复杂的历史。作为朋友的一部分，作为女儿的一部分，疯狂法师珍视着她。他无法想象没有她在他的地牢里的未来—因此他永远不会放手。至于{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}，她心情复杂；考虑到他为她做过的一切，以及{@i to}，她不能简单地恨哈拉斯特。地下山（Undermountain）既是她的家园，也是她的监狱—就像对他而言一样。",
	"Somehow, Halaster still has a fondness for the Seven, even if only out of nostalgia. Together, they're all one big, miserable, dysfunctional family unable to part ways. Although they appear quite infrequently, consider the following details about the surviving Seven and their relationships with their master:": "一些奇怪的是，哈拉斯特(Halaster) 仍然对七位学徒有一种喜爱，即使只是出于怀旧。他们一起组成了一个庞大、悲惨、功能失调的家庭，无法分道扬镳。尽管他们出现得相当少，但考虑以下关于幸存的七位学徒及他们与主人的关系的细节：",
	"Older Undermountain modules implied that {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} was in love with Halaster. This love, however, is unrequited—and that truth has cut her deep.": "旧版《地下山脉》模组暗示{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}爱上了哈拉斯特。然而，这份爱情是单相思的——这个事实深深伤害了她。",
	"Older Undermountain modules implied that {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} sought to overthrow Halaster. In L23, the {@i Companion} paints him as a would-be usurper perpetually denied his moment to strike. Additionally, it adds that he (unrequitedly) loves {@creature Arcturia|WDMM}; knowing the feelings she harbors for him fans the flames of his own treachery and resentment.": "旧版《地下山谷》模组暗示{@creature Trobriand|WDMM}试图推翻哈拉斯特。在L23中，{@i Companion}将他描绘成一个一直被剥夺机会的意图篡位者。此外，它还提到他（单相思地）爱着{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}；知道她对他怀有的感情煽动了他自己的背叛和怨恨之情。",
	"{@creature Marambra Nyghtsteel|WDMMC} was, per statements by the authors of WDMM, purposely left out of the module so that the DM can use her as he sees fit. The {@i Companion} includes her on L23.": "{@creature Marambra Nyghtsteel|WDMMC}根据WDMM的作者的说法，是故意在模块中留出的，以便DM可以根据自己的意愿使用她。{@i Companion}在L23上包括了她。",
	"{@creature Nester|WDMM}, who failed to achieve lichdom, teaches necromancy on L9. In WDMM he exists as a failed {@creature lich|MM}; the {@i Companion} instead turns him into a {@creature boneclaw|MTF} (see MTF) that must now serve Halaster. Until the Mad Mage is dead (no small feat, that), {@creature Nester|WDMM} cannot die, nor disobey. Despite his chains, {@creature Nester|WDMM} harbors no resentment to his master. He has since found much sadistic joy in torturing Dweomercore students.": "{@creature Nester|WDMM}，一个未能成功成为巫妖的人，在L9教授死灵术。在WDMM中，他作为一个失败的{@creature lich|MM}存在；{@i Companion}反而将他变成了一个{@creature boneclaw|MTF}（见MTF），现在必须侍奉哈拉斯特。在疯狂法师死去之前（这可不是小事），{@creature Nester|WDMM}不能死亡，也不能违抗。尽管被束缚，{@creature Nester|WDMM}对他的主人没有任何怨恨。他自那时起就发现了在折磨Dweomercore学生中找到了很多变态的快乐。",
	"{@creature Muiral|WDMM} blames his disfigurement—hell, his whole mess of a life—on Halaster. He not only detests the Mad Mage but is {@i terrified} of him. Years of isolation have done little for his already frayed sanity, and {@creature Muiral|WDMM} has since equated Halaster to a boogeyman. The kicker? {@creature Muiral|WDMM} considers his self-disfigurement a necessary measure to {@i thwart} his master's \"influence\" over his will.": "{@creature Muiral|WDMM} 将他的毁容——甚至整个混乱不堪的生活——归咎于哈拉斯特(Halaster)。他不仅憎恶这位疯狂法师，而且对他感到恐惧{@i terrified}。多年的孤立对他已经岌岌可危的理智没有什么帮助，{@creature Muiral|WDMM} 自此将哈拉斯特等同于鬼怪。更离谱的是，{@creature Muiral|WDMM} 认为自己的毁容是为了{@i thwart} 他主人对他意志的“影响”而采取的必要措施。",
	"Ultimately, Jhesiyra Kestellharp is the one ghost that keeps Halaster up at night. The one question that hounds him as he works. Her disappearance cut him to his very core—for the Mad Mage has abandonment issues like no other. He scorns her as a deserter, a treacherous daughter. Truly, he's afraid of her and the entire situation.": "最终，杰西拉·凯斯特尔哈普 (Jhesiyra Kestellharp) 是那个让哈拉斯特 (Halaster) 夜不能寐的幽灵。一个问题一直萦绕在他工作时的脑海中。她的失踪深深伤害了他的内心，因为这位疯狂法师拥有空前的被抛弃问题。他鄙视她，认为她是一个背叛者，一个不忠的女儿。实际上，他害怕她和整个情况。",
	"Despite plunging them into this horrid game, Halaster cherishes few others more than his beloved contestants. For them, he'll move the moon—or send it crashing down upon their heads. His idea of challenge is akin to a god pressing their thumb upon the world—walking the fine line between adversity and Armageddon. Should they ever complain about the hardships he visits upon them, he insists it's all to help them realize their \"true potential.\"": "尽管将他们投入这个可怕的游戏，哈拉斯特(Halaster)比他心爱的竞争者更珍视寥寥无几。为了他们，他会移动月亮——或让它坠落在他们头上。他对挑战的理解类似于神将拇指按在世界上——在逆境和末日之间走一条细线。如果他们抱怨他给予他们的困难，他坚持认为这一切都是为了帮助他们实现他们的“真正潜力”。",
	"When running WDMM with Halaster's Game, these goals take precedence over what is written in WDMM's overview chapter. All are active, no matter how deranged Halaster might currently be, and are prioritized in the following order:": "在与哈拉斯特的游戏中运行WDMM时，这些目标优先于WDMM概述章节中的内容。所有这些目标都是活跃的，无论哈拉斯特当前有多疯狂，都按以下顺序优先考虑：",
	"Halaster's foremost goal is to achieve the highest ratings for {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}. Every season (each featuring another adventuring party) is an opportunity for him to hone his craft. He does whatever is necessary to make a perfect season, short of performing a {@i deus ex machina} to save the contestants.": "哈拉斯特(Halaster)的首要目标是为{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}获得最高评分。每个季节(每个都有一个不同的冒险队伍)对他来说是磨练自己技艺的机会。他会尽一切必要的手段来打造一个完美的季节，但不至于进行{@i deus ex machina}来拯救参赛者。",
	"Contestants would be shocked to learn that Halaster is actually {@i rooting} for them. Every season has ended in bitter disappointment and he needs a win. While he won't spare the adventurers, he does not go out of his way to destroy them—not until they finally arrive to his lair on L23.": "参赛者会感到震惊，发现哈拉斯特实际上对他们是{@i rooting}。每个赛季都以痛苦的失望告终，他需要一场胜利。虽然他不会手软对待冒险者，但也不会刻意摧毁他们，直到他们最终抵达他在L23的巢穴。",
	"So seldom has a pupil impressed Halaster that he's always searching for the next—one who might even carry the mantle of \"Mad Mage\" one day. None of his current apprentices suffice, nor do any of the students of Dweomercore. No, Halaster's ideal apprentice is a contestant of {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}, one who bests him in combat.": "很少有学生能给哈拉斯特留下深刻印象，他总是在寻找下一个——也许甚至能有朝一日继承“疯狂法师”称号的人。他当前的学徒都不够格，Dweomercore的学生们也不行。不，哈拉斯特心目中理想的学徒是{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}的参赛者，一个能在战斗中打败他的人。",
	"Halaster prefers wizards as apprentices but will settle for (in this order) sorcerers, bards, and finally warlocks (whom he calls \"cheaters\"). So long as they can perform arcane magic and have a sufficient supply of \"moxie,\" Halaster will welcome them the same way he welcomed all his other apprentices: by putting them through a crucible.": "哈拉斯特更喜欢巫师作为学徒，但会接受（按照顺序）巫术师，诗人，最后是术士（他称之为“作弊者”）。只要他们能施展奥术魔法并具备足够的“胆识”，哈拉斯特将像对待其他学徒一样欢迎他们：让他们经历一场考验。",
	"Ideally, this candidate will prove their worth by besting his current apprentices (including the reluctant candidate {@creature Drivvin Freth|WDMM} of L12), as well as the students in {@adventure Dweomercore|WDMMC|12}.": "理想情况下，这位候选人将通过击败他当前的学徒（包括L12的候选人{@creature Drivvin Freth|WDMM}），以及{@adventure Dweomercore|WDMMC|12}中的学生来证明自己的价值。",
	"As described in WDMM, {@creature Ezzat|WDMM} the {@creature lich|MM} has earned Halaster's ire. To battle the {@creature lich|MM} himself would mean lowering himself to the undead's level, and so the Mad Mage directs adventurers to destroy {@creature Ezzat|WDMM}. See L20.": "正如《WDMM》所描述，{@creature Ezzat|WDMM} {@creature lich|MM} 招致了哈拉斯特的愤怒。与{@creature lich|MM} 本人交战意味着把自己降到不死生物的水平，因此疯狂法师指引冒险者去摧毁{@creature Ezzat|WDMM}。见L20。",
	"As written in WDMM, Halaster has entertained the idea of installing the Shadowdusks of L22 as puppets in control of Waterdeep—if only for the exercise of growing his influence or filming new game shows.": "正如《(WDMM)》所述，哈拉斯特曾考虑过将L22的影暮安装为他在瓦特德普的傀儡，即使只是为了增加他的影响力或拍摄新的游戏节目。",
	"The Mad Mage can tolerate a great many of things and admires many more: desperation, tenacity, stubbornness in the face of adversity. What he cannot abide, however, is pride—and the drow houses Auvryndar and Freth are chock-full of it. His irritation has soured into loathing, and he views them as parasites encroaching upon his domain.": "疯狂法师(Mad Mage)可以容忍许多事情，并钦佩更多：绝望、坚韧、在逆境中的顽强。然而，他无法容忍的是骄傲——而德罗(Drow)家族奥维恩达(Auvryndar)和弗瑞斯(Freth)却充斥着这种骄傲。他的烦恼已经变成了厌恶，他视它们为侵犯他领地的寄生虫。",
	"Halaster would like nothing more than to see them felled by the lowest, meekest, most humble of creatures possible. Thus, it makes a fitting challenge to the contestants of {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）最希望看到他们被最低微、最渺小、最谦卑的生物击倒。因此，这对{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}的参赛者来说是一个合适的挑战。",
	"The githyanki crusade against the mind flayer colony of Seadeeps is an amusing debacle for Halaster. He often films the conflict, hoping to either make a spin-off to {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage} or a documentary. However, he fears the conflict spiraling out of control and ending too soon. He'd rather keep the conflict alive for years to come so as to have more material.": "吉萨因凯对海深的食脑怪殖民地的十字军东征对哈拉斯特来说是一个有趣的失败。他经常拍摄这场冲突，希望要么制作成{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}的衍生作品，要么制作一部纪录片。然而，他担心冲突失控并过早结束。他宁愿让冲突持续多年，以便有更多素材。",
	"The fate of Jhesiyra still hounds Halaster, who considers her disappearance as the blackest of betrayals. The {@i Companion} leaves Jhesiyra's involvement in the campaign up to the DM. See L23 for details on how to include her in the campaign's final chapter.": "杰西拉的命运仍然困扰着哈拉斯特，他认为她的失踪是最严重的背叛。{@i Companion}让杰西拉在冒险中的参与取决于DM。有关如何在冒险的最后一章中包含她的详细信息，请参阅L23。",
	"Halaster's abilities are bound only by your imagination. You have carte blanche, so long as you do not use that to outright slaughter the adventurers. He is conveniently omniscient and nearly omnipotent. He is always surveilling—\"filming\" as he calls it—the adventurers in the form of {@spell arcane eye} and {@spell scrying} spells. Truly, he is the {@i dungeon master} of Undermountain.": "哈拉斯特的能力仅受你的想象力限制。你拥有完全的自由裁量权，只要不用来直接屠杀冒险者。他方便地无所不知，几乎无所不能。他总是在以{@spell arcane eye}和{@spell scrying}法术的形式监视——正如他所称之为的“拍摄”——冒险者。实际上，他是地下山的{@i dungeon master}。",
	"Halaster's list of prepared spells are of no concern to you. With eons of study, he knows literally every wizard spell. Don't be bogged down by what's in his statblock—until, of course, he and the adventurers are embroiled in a true fight, such as in the ultimate chapter of WDMM.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）准备的法术清单对你来说并不重要。通过无数年的研究，他几乎掌握了每一个巫师法术。不要被他的属性表所困扰——直到他和冒险者们卷入真正的战斗，比如在《WDMM》的最终章节中。",

	"Humiliating, betraying, or hurting a dear ally": "羞辱、背叛或伤害亲爱的盟友（dear ally）",
	"Scoring a critical hit against a creature Halaster's indifferent towards or detests": "对哈拉斯特（Halaster）漠视或憎恨的生物进行暴击得分",
	"Feats of daring, including defying death such as by succeeding on a Death saving throw": "大胆的壮举，包括挑战死亡，比如成功通过一次（Death saving throw）的豁免检定。",
	"Puns or other witty jokes": "双关语或其他风趣的笑话",

	"Sparing a foe of Halaster's": "对待哈拉斯特(Halaster)的敌人仁慈",
	"The value of an act is completely arbitrary, but the prices for prizes are fixed. The price in points of a nonmagical item is equal to its cost in gp. When it comes to magical items, the price is determined by rarity: 250 for a Common item, and 500 for Uncommon. Halaster refuses to award anything rarer than that. Any magic item he awards that has charges on it is destroyed upon reaching 0 charges. If a magic item doesn't normally have charges, assume it has 1–3 and is confiscated by Halaster after its use.": "一个行为的价值完全是任意的，但奖品的价格是固定的。非魔法物品的点数价格等于它在gp中的成本。至于魔法物品，价格由稀有度决定：普通物品为250点，不寻常物品为500点。哈拉斯特（Halaster）拒绝奖励任何比这更稀有的东西。他奖励的任何带有充能的魔法物品在充能用尽时被摧毁。如果一个魔法物品通常没有充能，假设它有1-3个充能，在使用后被哈拉斯特没收。",
	"Likewise, wizard spells of up to 2nd-level can be redeemed like {@spell knock} or {@spell enlarge/reduce}. 1st-level spells cost 300 points, and 2nd-level spells 500.

	"The following have been added to Halaster's Regional Effects:": "以下内容已添加到哈拉斯特的区域效应中：",
	"The Mad Mage sends a copy of himself, but not a {@spell simulacrum} per se, to interact with the party.

The Mad Mage knows everything the illusion says, hears, sees, and does.": "疯狂法师派遣了一个自己的分身，但并非一个{@spell simulacrum}本尊，与队伍互动。他可以通过这个幻象看到和说话，或者暂时赋予它足够的自主权和智慧，让它与冒险者交谈，而哈拉斯特忙于其他工作。疯狂法师知道幻象所说、听到、看到和做的一切。",
	"Halaster's madness manifests in a {@spell simulacrum} (created as if by the {@spell simulacrum} spell) which can harass the adventurers in nonlethal ways, such as casting {@spell wall of stone} or {@spell hallucinatory terrain} in their vicinity. The Mad Mage rarely becomes aware of a {@spell simulacrum} but destroys it when he does, fearing that it might one day rival him.": "哈拉斯特的疯狂表现为一个{@spell simulacrum}（仿佛是由{@spell simulacrum}法术创造的），可以以非致命的方式骚扰冒险者，比如在他们附近施放{@spell wall of stone}或{@spell hallucinatory terrain}。这位疯狂法师很少察觉到{@spell simulacrum}，但一旦发现就会摧毁它，担心有一天它可能会与他匹敌。",
	"Whenever you want to speak to your players through Halaster (\"That went well\" or \"Are you sure?\") you can have the Mad Mage telepathically communicate to the party without blowing their cover or revealing their presence to other creatures nearby.": "每当你想通过哈拉斯特 (Halaster) 与你的玩家交谈时（比如“那进展顺利”或“你确定吗？”），你可以让疯狂法师通过心灵感应与队伍沟通，而不会暴露他们的身份或让附近的其他生物察觉到他的存在。",
	"Halaster can randomly show up during combat and use his magic for hilariously, horrifying results—petrifying a {@creature goblin}, or wrenching and animating the {@creature skeleton} from a slain {@creature bugbear} (thus, adding a {@creature skeleton} to the encounter). So powerful is the Mad Mage that he has no initiative and no spells to be bound by—he's bound only by your imagination.": "哈拉斯特(Halaster)可能会在战斗中随机出现，并使用他的魔法带来令人捧腹的、可怕的结果——比如将一个{@creature goblin}石化，或者从被杀死的{@creature bugbear}身上扭曲并赋予生命{@creature skeleton}(从而为遭遇增加一个{@creature skeleton})。疯狂法师的力量如此强大，他没有先攻值，也没有被任何法术所束缚——他只受你的想象力所限制。",
	"A favorite antic of Halaster's is to curse a character with {@sense darkvision} to a life without it. A spell of {@spell remove curse} can restore a character's {@sense darkvision}, otherwise it returns whenever Halaster has grown tired of his prank. Alternatively, he can magically cause {@sense darkvision} to fail in a 100-foot-cubic area of his choosing.": "哈拉斯特(Halaster)最喜欢的恶作剧之一是用{@sense darkvision}诅咒一个角色，使其生活中没有{@sense darkvision}。一个{@spell remove curse}法术可以恢复一个角色的{@sense darkvision}，否则当哈拉斯特厌倦他的恶作剧时，{@sense darkvision}会重新消失。另外，他还可以在他选择的一个100立方英尺的区域内，用魔法使{@sense darkvision}失败。",
	"Halaster shunts the contestants into a demiplane stocked with whatever challenges or horrors he has in mind or teleports them elsewhere. If you want to insert a one-shot, especially any of the adventures written for WDMM by other authors, this is an ideal method to introducing it.": "哈拉斯特将参赛者推入一个半位面，其中充满了他心中想要的挑战或恐怖，或者将他们传送到其他地方。如果你想插入一个单场冒险，尤其是其他作者为《(WDMM)》写的冒险之一，这是引入的理想方法。",
	"Halaster targets a creature, subjecting it to a {@dc 16} Charisma saving throw.

No matter how titanic the conclusion to the events on one level, it's neighbors will hardly be affected.

	"Tracking the illithids of Seadeeps, the githyanki have raided Undermountain and carved out a piece of territory of their own: the Crystalline Labyrinth. After discovering the portal linking Undermountain to Stardock, one of the hollowed-out asteroids of Toril, the githyanki moved the majority of their forces there to create a stronghold and creche (a place where their young can safely age and train outside of the Astral Plane).

	"You can quickly throw together an adventuring party with the following tables.": "您可以使用以下表格快速组建一个冒险队伍。",
	"This adventure is a curious one. It's designed to see adventurers from 5th-level to the mythic fourth tier of play—and yet, since it's all confined in one dungeon, little story can be expected to develop. Further, a high mortality rate can be expected given Undermountain's lack of civilization and overabundant perils.": "这个冒险是一个奇特的冒险。它旨在让冒险者从5级到传奇第四层级的游戏中体验—然而，由于一切都局限在一个地牢中，很少会有故事发展。此外，由于安德瞄地下城缺乏文明且危险重重，可以预期死亡率较高。",
	"A campaign that reaches 17th-level, let alone 20th, is the stuff of dreams for many a player. However, given WDMM's lack of narrative, characters might lack for personal growth unless you, the DM, go out of your way to intertwine the adventurers' personal development with the dungeon or allow them a brief foray to the surface. Several quest hooks are included to alleviate WDMM's inherent flaw.": "许多玩家梦寐以求的是达到17级，更不用说20级了。然而，鉴于《WDMM》缺乏叙事，角色可能缺乏个人成长，除非你作为DM特意将冒险者的个人发展与地牢交织在一起，或者允许他们短暂地前往地表。为缓解《WDMM》固有的缺陷，包含了几个任务钩子。",
	"Despite being advertised as a sequel to Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, this adventure can't be any more different.

If your players are intent on bringing their Dragon Heist characters, don't skimp out on this warning.": "尽管被宣传为《瓦特德普：龙藏富翁》的续集，这个冒险却完全不同。《瓦特德普的龙神之迷》不仅鼓励，而且要求角色在战斗中进行优化，进行地牢探险——而不是为了揭开阴谋并在社交场合表现出色而设计的角色。如果你的玩家坚持要使用他们的《龙藏富翁》角色，不要忽视这个警告。",
	"This adventure is, without all the bells and whistles, a mega-dungeon crawl, harkening back to the ancient days of D&D. While other published 5E adventures do their best to dispel the necessity of having a dedicated healer and a dedicated defender, WDMM essentially requires it. Parties that don't follow this paradigm will find themselves in trouble later.": "这个冒险，简而言之，是一个大型地牢探险，回溯到D&D的古老时代。虽然其他已出版的5版冒险尽力消除需要专门的治疗者和防御者的必要性，但《(WDMM)》基本上要求这样做。不遵循这一范式的队伍将会在后期陷入麻烦。",
	"The adventurers will be hard-pressed to find the time or safety for a long rest. They may often be forced to travel through one or two levels before they can actually rest—they shouldn't expect to begin or finish a new level with the benefit of a long rest. Thus, a party that is overly-reliant on long rests, as opposed to short rests, will struggle while parties with fighters, warlocks, and monks will fare a bit better.": "冒险者们将很难找到时间或安全条件进行长时间休息。他们经常会被迫在能够真正休息之前穿越一到两个层级，他们不应该指望在开始或完成新层级时能够享受长时间休息的好处。因此，一个过分依赖长时间休息而不是短时间休息的队伍将会遇到困难，而拥有战士、术士和武僧的队伍会稍微好一些。",

	"While hardly mentioned, it's more than likely that a few {@creature deep gnome|WDMMC|deep gnomes} eke out a living in Undermountain. One {@creature druid|MM} in particular once tended to a Zurkhwood grove on Level 4 before the {@creature aboleth|MM} Illuun arrived.

	"The bowels of Undermountain teem with {@creature drow|MM} as Houses Freth and Auvryndar duke it out for sovereignty.

	"Since ancient days, the {@creature duergar|MM} have claimed the depths of Undermountain as their own. Their clans now comb the dungeon for riches.

	"From the Crystal Labyrinth, a githyanki force wages war against the {@creature mind flayer|MM} colony of Seadeeps. Additionally, a group of githzerai inhabit Level 15, ready and willing to aid their distant cousins if the need arises.

	"{@creature bugbear|MM|Bugbears}, {@creature goblin|MM|goblins}, and {@creature hobgoblin|MM|hobgoblins} permeate the upper reaches of Undermountain, often serving in the Xanathar Guild, the Legion of Azrok, or the Goblin Bazaar. Goblinoid adventurers could be recruited from any of these factions with motivations of expanding its influence or escaping out from under the thumb of their rulers. For example, a member of the Legion of Azrok might discover that {@creature intellect devourer|MM|intellect devourers} have replaced the minds of many of the Legion's finest. Fearing for their own life, they might get out before it's too late. See Volo's Guide to Monsters for details on goblinoid player characters.": "{@creature bugbear|MM|Bugbears}, {@creature goblin|MM|goblins}, and {@creature hobgoblin|MM|hobgoblins}渗透到安德矿山的上层地区，通常效力于Xanathar公会、Azrok军团或者哥布林市场。哥布林冒险者可能从这些派系中的任何一个招募，动机可能是扩大影响力或摆脱统治者的控制。例如，Azrok军团的一名成员可能发现{@creature intellect devourer|MM|intellect devourers}已经取代了许多军团中最优秀的成员的思想。担心自己的生命安全，他们可能会在为时已晚之前离开。有关哥布林玩家角色的详细信息，请参阅《沃罗怪物指南》。",
	"The Port of Shadows has existed for so long that it's feasible for almost any character of any race to emerge as an adventurer. Characters are bound only (mostly) by their imagination.

	"Why venture to Undermountain? It's a good question, one to be asked by both you and your players. Unlike other adventures whose motives boil down to saving the world or escaping some dark prison, WDMM is one that is, seemingly, spurred only by the lust for gold and glory. It therefore falls upon you to keep your players invested in Undermountain. The universal motives of gold, glory, and power can only interest the adventurers for so long, especially as they get to the more lethal levels. It's recommended you instead turn to your own players as a source of creativity.": "为什么要冒险前往地下山（Undermountain）呢？这是一个很好的问题，应该由你和你的玩家共同提出。与其他冒险的动机是拯救世界或逃离某个黑暗监狱不同，WDMM 是一个看似只受到对黄金和荣耀的欲望驱使的冒险。因此，你需要让你的玩家对地下山保持投入。黄金、荣耀和权力这些普遍的动机只能吸引冒险者们一段时间，特别是当他们到达更危险的层次时。建议你转而将注意力放在你自己的玩家身上，作为创造力的源泉。",

Therefore, this level is an exercise of restraint and tact on the part of the party.": "这一章是叙事性质的，而非探索性质的。冒险者们应该与{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}进行密切互动，并逐渐意识到这位自然典范具有巨大、无情的愤怒。因此，这个层次是一种对冒险队来说需要克制和策略的练习。",
	"It's autumn when the party arrives. Day is darkening into dusk and a full moon is due.": "当派对抵达时，正值秋天。白天渐渐变暗，夜幕降临，一轮满月即将升起。",
	"While your adventurers are likely to take a long rest early, you want them to first meet {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} (see Act II below), as many events occur at night.": "尽管你的冒险者可能会早早地休息，但你希望他们首先遇到{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} (见下文第二幕)，因为许多事件发生在夜间。",
	"Tunnels connect to both Levels 6 & 7 (see A8 & 10). To prevent the party from taking these tunnels, you can require they secure {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} permission first—as entering her domain is easy but leaving is forbidden. She only grants permission if the adventurers wipe out the {@creature werebat|WDMM} colony.": "隧道连接到6级和7级（见A8和10）。为防止冒险者通过这些隧道，你可以要求他们首先获得{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的许可——因为进入她的领地很容易，但离开是被禁止的。只有当冒险者消灭{@creature werebat|WDMM}殖民地时，她才会授予许可。",
	"Three arcane gates are on this level: one to L2 (see A3B), L3 (see A6I) and L6 (see A9). The latter is too high of a level for the party to open.": "这一层有三个奥术之门：一个通往L2（见A3B），一个通往L3（见A6I），还有一个通往L6（见A9）。后者对于队伍来说是一个太高等级无法打开的门。",
	"{@creature Cloaker|MM|Cloakers} lair in A4. They can speak both {@language Deep Speech|PHB} and {@language Undercommon|PHB}, so prepare extra dialogue if the adventurers can speak either language.": "{@creature Cloaker|MM|Cloakers}巢穴在A4。它们可以说{@language Deep Speech|PHB}和{@language Undercommon|PHB}，所以如果冒险者会说其中任何一种语言，准备额外的对话。",
	"Halaster takes a backseat for this level, only appearing to share the secrets of {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} past. See Halaster's Visit in Special Events.": "Halaster在这一层退居幕后，只会出现来分享{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}过去的秘密。请查看特殊事件中的Halaster的访问。",

See Other Considerations below.": "为你的冒险者准备好签订或甚至请求{@creature werebat|WDMM} {@variantrule Player Characters as Lycanthropes|MM|lycanthropy}。请参阅其他注意事项。",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} makes for a fantastic antagonist for several reasons, but the most promising is this: no one ever suspects druids of being evil—and make no mistake, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} has great evil in her. Her alignment may officially be chaotic neutral, but there is nothing good, or even neutral, about murdering campers that dare start a fire to stay warm; promising genocide to a species that has no choice but to suck blood; and eradicating a cult—dedicated to a god of hunting—for the mistake of hunting too many boars. Alas, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} believes herself to be just and right—and that's what makes her truly evil.": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 之所以成为一个出色的反派，原因有很多，但最有潜力的是这一点：没有人会怀疑德鲁伊会是邪恶的——毫无疑问，{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 的内心充满了邪恶。她的立场可能正式是混乱中立，但在杀害那些敢于生火取暖的露营者时，承诺对一种只能吸血的物种进行种族灭绝，以及根除一个以狩猎之神为信仰的邪教——因为错误地猎杀了太多野猪，这些行为中没有任何善良，甚至中立的成分。可惜，{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 自认为自己是正义和正确的化身——这正是使她真正邪恶的原因。",
	"The {@creature archdruid|VGM} is a creature of unending compassion—for wildlife. People, however, stoke the coals of her paranoia and remind her of all she's lost. {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} nurses two fears that dominate her entire personality: growing attached to another person, and admitting that the awakened sycophants she's surrounded herself with aren't enough to satisfy her—she can frolic with beasts all she likes, but they can never be human.": "{@creature archdruid|VGM}是一个永无止境的怜悯之物——对于野生动物。然而，人们却煽动了她的偏执，让她想起了自己失去的一切。{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}养育着两种主导她整个人格的恐惧：与另一个人产生依恋，并承认她所包围的那些觉醒谄媚者并不能满足她——她可以与野兽嬉戏，但它们永远不会是人类。",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} is also adamant with her prejudices and opinions:": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 也对她的偏见和观点坚定不移：",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} considers the dragon a valued member of the forest and demands visitors show \"{@item Tearulai|WDMM}\" respect.": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}认为龙是森林中受尊敬的成员，并要求访客对\"{@item Tearulai|WDMM}\"表示尊重。",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} considers and describes the {@creature werebat|WDMM|werebats} as insatiable vermin infesting her realm. They have no \"natural place\" in her woods, nor the circle of life itself. She tolerated such pitiable creatures until recently when the gluttony of one {@creature werebat|WDMM} convinced her that they're nothing more than parasites. She wants them gone from her realm immediately and no means are too red.": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}认为并描述{@creature werebat|WDMM|werebats}为滋扰她领地的贪婪害虫。他们在她的树林中没有\"自然位置\"，也不在生命循环中。她曾容忍这些可怜的生物，直到最近一个{@creature werebat|WDMM}的贪婪让她相信他们只是寄生虫。她希望立即将它们从她的领地中清除，不惜任何手段。",
	"In {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} mind, she can do no wrong—and any wrong is, of course, justified. She had to kill Crissann; his mind was bent by Halaster. Slaughtering the Cult of Malar was nothing short of justice for the wildlife they slaughtered. And all the adventurers that have passed through this forest? They all had it coming. When confronted with her crimes, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} doesn't lie or cover up her deeds, but instead owns them with pride. Only the death of her late husband, Yinark, haunts her—and there is no way for her to justify her actions.": "在{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的心目中，她没有做错的事情——任何错误当然都是有道理的。她不得不杀死克里桑；他的思想被哈拉斯特扭曲了。屠杀玛拉尔教派绝对是为了他们屠杀的野生动物而行的正义之举。而所有穿过这片森林的冒险者？他们都是活该。当面对她的罪行时，{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}并不撒谎或掩盖她的行为，而是自豪地承认。只有她已故丈夫伊纳克的死亡让她感到内疚——而她无法为自己的行为辩解。",
	"Despite her vow to never again let a mortal touch her heart, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} still yearns for companionship. The trouble, she rationalized, was being with men of the blade or the Arcane. If a druid, ranger, nature cleric, or other person with a strong bond to Nature entered her domain, she might consider taking them as a consort.": "尽管誓言再也不让凡人触及她的心，{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 仍然渴望伴侣。她理智地解释说，问题在于与持刀或奥术之人为伴。如果一个德鲁伊、游侠、自然牧师或其他与自然有着强烈联系的人进入她的领地，她可能会考虑接纳他们为伴侣。",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} is the central character of this level; all roads lead back to her. Long before the adventurers realize her evil, they'll have wandered into her web. This intrigue can be cultivated through these points:": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 是这个层级的中心人物；所有的道路都通向她。冒险者们在意识到她的邪恶之前，很久以前就已经陷入了她的陷阱。通过以下几点可以培养这种情节：",
	"Play upon the druid's stereotype and adventurers' assumptions. All druids are just peace-loving hippies, right?": "玩弄德鲁伊的刻板印象和冒险者的假设。所有德鲁伊都只是爱好和平的嬉皮士，对吗？",
	"Paint an innocent faction as evil—the {@creature werebat|WDMM|werebats}.": "把一个无辜的派系描绘成邪恶的——{@creature werebat|WDMM|werebats}。",
	"Present {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} as a good or tragic hero that the adventurers will be inclined to side with. If they begin to accuse others of her crimes, you've done your job.": "将{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}塑造成一个好的或悲剧性的英雄，让冒险者倾向于支持她。如果他们开始指责其他人犯下她的罪行，那么你的工作就完成了。",
	"Inevitably, the adventurers will incur {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} wrath and the fly will realize it's been in the spider's web all this time.": "不可避免地，冒险者们将招致{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的愤怒，而这只苍蝇将意识到自己一直被蜘蛛网困住了。",
	"Consider the entirety of Wyllowwood as one story, which is divided into the following acts:": "将整个Wyllowwood视为一个故事，分为以下几个部分：",
	"The adventurers reach the splendor of Wyllowwood. The shock of its beauty will be thawed soon enough when they realize this isn't the idyllic wonderland it's painted as. They first find {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} sign in Area 2, then the discarded objects in Area 5. This is necessary foreshadowing of {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} evil—but to foil it, {@item Tearulai|WDMM}, the {@creature young green dragon|MM}, is seen soaring above the canopy to his platform (Area 9).": "冒险者们抵达了维洛伍德(Wyllowwood)的壮丽景色。当他们意识到这并不是被描绘成的田园仙境时，美丽的震撼很快就会消退。他们首先在区域2发现了{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的标志，然后在区域5发现了被丢弃的物品。这是{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}邪恶的必要铺垫——为了挫败它，{@creature young green dragon|MM}，作为{@item Tearulai|WDMM}，被看到在树冠上空中飞翔，飞往他的平台(区域9)。",
	"The adventurers find themselves face-to-face with {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} in any of the following ways:": "冒险者们以以下任何一种方式与{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}面对面：",
	"The party sights the tower (A6) and may press on towards it. Or, a sparrow under the effect of an {@spell animal messenger} spell invites them to visit. Sky's the limit, right?": "队伍发现了塔楼（A6），可以继续前往。或者，一只受到{@spell animal messenger}咒语影响的麻雀邀请他们前往。天空是极限，对吧？",
	"While traveling along the river or through the woods, they find {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} bathing. Ever confident, she emerges from the water to greet the party, inviting them to her tower for a \"more formal audience.\" She takes her leave by shapeshifting into a {@creature raven|MM} and making for Area 6.": "当沿着河流或穿过树林旅行时，他们发现{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}在沐浴。她自信满满地从水中走出来，邀请队伍去她的塔楼进行“更正式的会面”。她变形成{@creature raven|MM}后离开，前往第6区。",
	"The adventurers come across a glade in the woods. Napping at its center or in the boughs of a tree is {@creature Wyllow|WDMM}. If woken, she smiles and greets the adventurers, inviting them to her tower. She takes her leave by shapeshifting into a {@creature raven|MM}.": "冒险者们来到树林中的一个空地。在中心打盹，或者在树枝上的是{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}。如果被唤醒，她会微笑着向冒险者们打招呼，并邀请他们去她的塔楼。最后，她会变形成一个{@creature raven|MM}离开。",
	"Once the party meets {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} at her tower, she introduces herself and explains just how a forest has thrived so deep underground. So long as the adventurers don't harm the forest or its wildlife, she guarantees them safe harbor.": "一旦派对在她的塔楼遇见{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}，她会介绍自己并解释森林是如何在地下深处茁壮成长的。只要冒险者不伤害森林或其野生动物，她保证他们能得到安全庇护。",
	"While normally, visitors are free to enter and leave Wyllowwood, the {@i Companion} has twisted that. Entering is easy; leaving requires the {@creature druid|MM|druid's} permission, which she only grants if the adventurers wipe out the {@creature werebat|WDMM} colony (A12–16). {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} describes them as parasites and criminals that disobey her laws.": "尽管通常情况下，游客可以自由进出Wyllowwood，但{@i Companion}已经扭曲了这一点。进入很容易；离开则需要{@creature druid|MM|druid's}的许可，只有在冒险者消灭{@creature werebat|WDMM}殖民地(A12-16)后，她才会授予许可。{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}将他们描述为违背她法律的寄生虫和罪犯。",
	"All {@creature werebat|WDMM|werebats}, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} insists, must be put to the sword—and little do the adventurers know that that includes the children too. If the adventurers refuse to cut down the babes and return to her, they incur {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} wrath. See {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} Hunt below. See A6A below for dialogue and details.": "所有{@creature werebat|WDMM|werebats}，{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}坚持认为，必须被处以死刑——冒险者们并不知道这也包括儿童。如果冒险者们拒绝杀死婴儿并回到她那里，他们将招致{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的愤怒。请查看下方的{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}猎杀。有关对话和详细信息，请查看下方的A6A。",
	"After meeting with {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} and accepting her quest, the remaining omens must be broadcast to the adventurers. They serve to sow doubt in the players' minds and to push them into questioning {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} morality—or instead siding with their biases about druids. See, every time they're confronted by the evidence of {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} dark deeds, they should wonder: was it the druidess or the dragon or some other outside force? Surely sweet little {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} couldn't be capable of this.": "与{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}会面并接受她的任务后，剩下的预兆必须向冒险者们传达。它们旨在在玩家们的心中播下怀疑的种子，并推动他们质疑{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的道德——或者选择站在他们对德鲁伊的偏见一边。每当他们面对{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}邪恶行径的证据时，他们应该思考：是德鲁伊女祭司还是龙或其他外部力量？当然，可爱的小{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}不可能做出这种事情。",
	"The following omens should be presented to the party:": "以下征兆应该呈现给队伍：",
	"The skeletal remains of the Malar cult in A7. No weapon or burn marks mar the remains, suggesting these sixty humans all died to something toxic—and didn't the party already catch a glimpse of a green dragon?": "在A7中发现了玛拉教派的骷髅遗骸。没有发现任何武器或烧伤痕迹，这表明这六十名人类都死于某种有毒物质——而且难道派对不是已经瞥见了一只绿龙了吗？",
	"Malar's Haven, the abandoned complex (A18–20), which should have the adventurers wonder what catastrophe befell the inhabitants—after all, the possessions all lie untouched. It's as if they never knew what hit them.": "玛拉的避风港，这座被遗弃的建筑群(A18-20)，应该让冒险者们想知道居民们遭遇了什么样的灾难——毕竟，所有的财产都还未被动过。就好像他们从未意识到发生了什么。",
	"Having seen visitors enter Wyllowwood, Vool the Outcast approaches the adventurers. As a nocturnal creature, the most opportune moment would be at night while the party rests. However, the {@creature werebat|WDMM} is desperate enough to approach during the day. See A Desperate Vool in Special Events below.": "在看到游客进入(威洛伍德)后，被流放者(沃尔)接近了冒险者们。作为一个夜行性生物，最适合的时机应该是在晚上，当队伍休息时。然而，{@creature werebat|WDMM} 在白天也已经绝望到足够接近了。请参阅特殊事件中的《绝望的(沃尔)》。",
	"Sensing visitors to this realm, Valdemar, the {@creature young green dragon|MM}, uses the last of its will to send secret messages to the adventurers by reshaping twigs and leaves or by leaving whispers on the wind. All say, \"Free me. Please.\" Pepper them in as you see fit. Gentle winds blow towards Area 9.": "感知到来访者，瓦尔德马尔，{@creature young green dragon|MM}，利用最后一丝意志，通过重塑树枝和树叶或者在风中留下细语，向冒险者发送秘密信息。所有信息都说：“释放我。拜托。” 请根据需要适当插入。和风吹向区域9。",
	"Should they free Valdemar by pulling {@item Tearulai|WDMM} from its skull, the dragon promises its wrath if the party confronts {@creature Wyllow|WDMM}. This is a lie—unless the battle turns overwhelmingly in the party's favor. With {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} dead, the dragon will rule this land.": "如果他们通过从龙头上拔出{@item Tearulai|WDMM}来释放瓦尔德马尔，那条龙承诺如果队伍与{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}对抗，它会发泄怒火。这是个谎言——除非战斗明显倒向队伍一方。如果{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}死了，那条龙将统治这片土地。",
	"If {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} learns that the adventurers have freed Valdemar, she sets out to destroy them.": "如果{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}得知冒险者们已经释放了瓦尔德马，她会出发去摧毁他们。",
	"At last, the climax of this level. The adventurers incur {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} wrath—or confront her over her many crimes—and must face a guerrilla fighter served by the forest itself. See {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} Hunt for the play-by-play of how this battle turns out.": "终于，这一关的高潮来临了。冒险者们招致{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的愤怒—或者因她的众多罪行而与她对抗—他们必须面对由森林本身服务的游击战士。查看{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}《猎杀》以了解这场战斗的详细过程。",
	"When the adventurers incur {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} wrath, her \"justice\" is swift and brutal. A sadist deluded by her own lies, this predator hunts down the party in a myriad of ways. Facing her is a lesson in guerrilla warfare, for this one-woman army is a nightmare to behold. Never will they face her in a stuffy room or enclosed environment and never will she offer them a fair fight.": "当冒险者招致{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的愤怒时，她的“正义”是迅速而残酷的。这位被自己谎言蒙蔽的虐待狂者，以多种方式猎杀着队伍。面对她是游击战的一课，因为这位独行的军队是一场可怕的噩梦。他们永远不会在拥挤的房间或封闭的环境中面对她，她也永远不会给他们一个公平的战斗。",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} stages a series of ambushes, mainly determined by location or your own whimsy. The adventurers will lack for an easy battle, for the druidess strikes surgically from afar, armed with potent magic, loyal servants, and a terrain she knows better than anyone. This confrontation is not so much a battle but a desperate escape from her wrath, punctuated by motes of fire and fanged beasts.": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 策划了一系列伏击，主要取决于地点或你自己的心血来潮。冒险者们将不会轻易获得胜利，因为这位德鲁伊女祭司远距离精准打击，拥有强大的魔法、忠诚的仆从，以及她比任何人都熟悉的地形。这场对抗不仅仅是一场战斗，更像是从她的愤怒中绝望逃脱，伴随着火焰和獠牙兽的出现。",
	"When {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} begins her hunt, she visits her tower (Area 6) and sets the Calendar Stone to night, so that she can ambush her prey under the cover of darkness. She also forces winter upon Wyllowwood, making it an environment of {@hazard extreme cold} (see the sidebar above for its effects).": "当{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}开始狩猎时，她会前往她的塔楼（区域6）并将日历石设定为夜晚，这样她就可以在黑暗中伏击猎物。她还让冬天笼罩在Wyllowwood上，使其成为一个{@hazard extreme cold}的环境（请参见上面的边栏了解其效果）。",

	"Sour over their past behavior, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} will not tolerate any more lycanthropes in her domain. She demands the cursed character submit to a cleansing ritual (in the form of a {@spell remove curse} spell) or be banished from her demesne.": "对于他们过去的行为感到愤怒，{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 不会容忍在她领地内再有任何狼人。她要求那个被诅咒的角色接受一场净化仪式（以{@spell remove curse}咒语的形式）或被驱逐出她的领地。",
	"Hey, if one character is virtually immune to most attacks, that just means you can amp up combat from here on out, right? Halaster telepathically tells them, \"Now that you're cursed, I have no excuse to hold back. Enjoy!\" You, as the DM, now have carte blanche to add all sorts of baddies to future encounters.": "嘿，如果一个角色几乎免疫大多数攻击，那只意味着你可以从现在开始加强战斗，对吧？哈拉斯特（Halaster）通过心灵感应告诉他们：“现在你们被诅咒了，我没有理由再退缩。尽情享受吧！”作为DM，你现在可以放手在未来的战斗中加入各种坏家伙。",
	"Halaster can cause a ray of sunlight to always shine above the lycanthrope, disadvantaging it per the Sunlight Sensitivity trait.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）可以让一道阳光始终照耀在狼人（lycanthrope）头顶上，使其在太阳光敏感（Sunlight Sensitivity）特质下处于劣势。",
	"Your campaign might be drastically altered if the adventurers take {@item Tearulai|WDMM} (see A9). Not only is it an incredibly powerful weapon, it also has the will and drive to return to the place of its creation—with its wielder forced to come along for the ride.": "如果冒险者拿走{@item Tearulai|WDMM}（见A9），你的冒险可能会发生巨大变化。这不仅是一把极其强大的武器，它还有意志和动力回到它创造的地方——而持有者被迫跟着一起前往。",
	"If the adventurers claim this sword, you must be prepared for the campaign to take a sudden detour as {@item Tearulai|WDMM} attempts to return to Myth Drannor by means of its wielder—or just scrap that entirely. It would be far less disruptive to your game to give {@item Tearulai|WDMM} patience, but then there's no danger or drawback to using the sword.": "如果冒险者们拿到这把剑，你必须准备好战役突然改变方向，因为{@item Tearulai|WDMM}试图通过持剑者返回迷思德兰诺，或者干脆放弃这个设定。给{@item Tearulai|WDMM}耐心可能会减少游戏的干扰，但这样就没有使用这把剑的危险或不利之处了。",
	"Assuming you keep this danger in play, if its wielder's goals run counter to its own, {@item Tearulai|WDMM} attempts to take control of its wielder (subjecting it to a {@dc 17} Charisma saving throw). On a failure, the wielder is {@condition charmed} for {@dice 1d12} hours, during which {@item Tearulai|WDMM} attempts to reach the surface. The blade is cunning enough to wait until the adventurers encounter a quick means to the surface, such as one of Halaster's arcane gates. The most opportune gate is on Level 10, which links to Level 1. {@item Tearulai|WDMM} would take that very moment to strike.": "假设您保持这种危险存在，如果使用者的目标与其相悖，{@item Tearulai|WDMM} 会试图控制使用者（使其进行一次 {@dc 17} 魅力豁免检定）。如果失败，使用者会被 {@condition charmed}，持续 {@dice 1d12} 小时，在此期间 {@item Tearulai|WDMM} 会试图抵达地表。这把刀足够狡猾，会等到冒险者们遇到快速通往地表的方法，比如哈拉斯特的奥术之门之类的。最合适的门在第10层，连接到第1层。{@item Tearulai|WDMM} 会选择那个时刻发动攻击。",
	"{@item Tearulai|WDMM} admires great beauty, music, fine art, and poetry. Vain, the weapon strives to improve its appearance. It craves gemstones and seeks out better ones with which to adorn itself. Most of all, it longs to return to the forests around Myth Drannor, where it was created.": "{@item Tearulai|WDMM} 钦佩着伟大的美丽、音乐、精美的艺术和诗歌。这把武器是虚荣的，它努力改善自己的外表。它渴望宝石，并寻找更好的宝石来装饰自己。最重要的是，它渴望回到在米斯·德兰诺附近的森林，那里是它被创造的地方。",
	"If {@item Tearulai|WDMM} is acquired, you can use it as a new character for the adventurers. Use the sword as a mouthpiece for Undermountain, granting it vast knowledge of the dungeon—never enough to ruin a surprise, but able to reveal background information that you're struggling to convey to your players. The blade may even consider answering these questions as a quid pro quo, stacking up a debt—which can take the form as a cumulative −1 penalty to a character's Charisma saving throw to avoid being {@condition charmed} by {@item Tearulai|WDMM}.": "如果获得{@item Tearulai|WDMM}，你可以将其用作冒险者的新角色。使用剑作为地下山的代言人，赋予它对地牢的广泛知识——永远不会透露足以破坏惊喜的信息，但可以揭示你难以传达给玩家的背景信息。这把剑甚至可能会以问答的方式回答这些问题，积累一笔债务——这可以形成一个累积的-1惩罚，用于角色的魅力豁免投掷，以避免被{@item Tearulai|WDMM}所{@condition charmed}。",
	"The River of the Depths twists below the mountain, sometimes lit by iridescent fungi but more often cloaked in darkness. The farther on you go, the quicker it grows until the waters swell into rapids and its roar into thunder.": "深渊河在山脚下蜿蜒流淌，有时被虹彩般的真菌照亮，但更多时候被黑暗所笼罩。随着你继续前行，河流变得越来越急，直到水流膨胀成急流，轰鸣如雷。",
	"If the party arrives to Wyllowwood by means of a boat, you can kick off this level with a skill challenge. The river hits nasty rough water before spilling out into this idyllic wonderland. The party must navigate the rapids.": "如果队伍乘船抵达(維洛伍德)Wyllowwood，你可以通过技能挑战来开始这一关。河流在涌入这片田园仙境之前会经历恶劣的急流。队伍必须航行过急流。",
	"Skill challenges are a relic of 4th Edition that recently made an unofficial comeback in 5E. Rather than fight, players must navigate a danger through their skills (making ability checks). Think of it as a montage.": "技能挑战是第四版的遗留物，最近在第五版中非官方地卷土重来。与其战斗，玩家必须通过他们的技能（进行能力检定）来应对危险。可以将其想象成一段蒙太奇。",
	"The party must succeed on four ability checks before failing three. Once a character has used a specific skill, they personally can't use it again for the remainder of the challenge. This is to spur creativity and prevent the rogue from repeatedly use his {@skillCheck acrobatics 9} {@skill Acrobatics} skill. Players suggest skills to overcome obstacles, such as {@skill Perception} to sight the stalactites ahead before hitting them. At your discretion, a player can only use a skill they're proficient with, so as to lend importance to it.": "队伍必须在失败三次之前成功通过四次能力检定。一旦角色使用了特定技能，他们个人在挑战的剩余部分就不能再使用它。这是为了激发创造力，防止盗贼反复使用他的{@skillCheck acrobatics 9} {@skill Acrobatics}技能。玩家可以建议使用技能来克服障碍，比如{@skill Perception}来提前发现前方的钟乳石。酌情而定，玩家只能使用他们精通的技能，以突显其重要性。",
	"The challenge is divided into obstacles, described below. Roll initiative simply to have an order for the players to go in. They don't need to adhere to the order, but it does help critical thinking. On their turn, each player suggests a skill or tool to overcome an obstacle. Not coming up with a solution carries no penalty, unless no one can, in which case the party accumulates one failure—the price of indecision.": "挑战被分为障碍，如下所述。简单地进行先攻骰来确定玩家的顺序。他们不需要遵循这个顺序，但这有助于批判性思维。在他们的回合中，每位玩家提出一个技能或工具来克服一个障碍。如果没有想出解决方案，不会受到任何惩罚，除非没有人能够，那么团队将累积一次失败——这是犹豫的代价。",
	"Failing an ability check merely means the vessel takes damage. On the third failure, the vessel is destroyed, and the characters are overcome by the rapids. Eventually, they spill out into Wyllowwood after suffering {@damage 4d8} bludgeoning damage.": "在本地语言习惯的基础上，未通过能力检定仅意味着船只受到伤害。第三次失败时，船只被摧毁，角色被急流冲倒。最终，他们在承受{@damage 4d8}钝击伤害后漂流到了威洛伍德（Wyllowwood）。",
	"The following obstacles have been written for you; replace them as you see fit. The DCs of all ability checks are also left up to you, though they ought to be high considering the party is 8th level and this river is a treacherous one.": "以下障碍已经为您准备好了；根据需要进行替换。所有技能检定的难度等级也由您决定，考虑到队伍是8级，而这条河流非常危险。\n\n1. A narrow bridge made of rotting wood spans the river. The planks are loose and slippery, requiring a DC 18 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to cross safely.\n2. A strong current rushes through a narrow gorge, making it difficult to swim across. A DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check is needed to reach the other side without being swept away.\n3. A series of stepping stones are partially submerged in the fast-flowing water. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check is needed to spot the safest path across.\n4. A sudden gust of wind threatens to knock anyone on the bridge off-balance. A DC 16 Strength saving throw is required to remain steady.\n5. A slippery rock face must be climbed to bypass a waterfall. A DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check is needed to ascend safely.\n6. A hidden whirlpool lurks beneath the surface, ready to pull swimmers under. A DC 17 Constitution saving throw is required to break free if caught in its grasp.",
	"The party encounters rough waters that soon swell into rapids. Suggestions include vehicle (water) checks or {@skill Survival} to navigate the channel without crashing into rocks.": "队伍遇到了波涛汹涌的水域，很快就变成了急流。建议进行水上载具检查或者使用{@skill Survival}来避开撞到岩石的危险。",
	"A band of {@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks} are spearing fish along the river. Suggestions include {@skill Stealth} to remain undetected (as {@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks} are blind); {@skill Performance} to sound like a predator; {@skill Perception} to detect them long before they can; or {@skill Sleight of Hand} to toss an object so as to distract them. On a failure, the {@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks} hurl four {@item spear|PHB|spears} ({@hit 5} to hit, {@damage 1d6 + 3} piercing damage) at the characters or their boat.": "一群{@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks}正在河边用矛捕鱼。建议包括{@skill Stealth}保持隐蔽（因为{@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks}是盲的）；{@skill Performance}模仿捕食者的声音；{@skill Perception}能提前发现它们；或者{@skill Sleight of Hand}扔一个物体来分散它们的注意力。如果失败，这些{@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks}会向角色或他们的船投掷四个{@item spear|PHB|spears}（命中{@hit 5}，造成{@damage 1d6 + 3}穿刺伤害）。",
	"The hull is breached by stones below the surface and water fills the vessel. With a successful {@skill Sleight of Hand} check, one could be quick enough to bail water, while {@item carpenter's tools|PHB} could patch up the hole, provided there's adequate material such as pitch or tar.": "船体被水下的石头击穿，水开始灌进船舱。通过成功的{@skill Sleight of Hand}检定，有人可以迅速舀水，而{@item carpenter's tools|PHB}可以修补漏洞，前提是有足够的材料，如沥青或焦油。",
	"Stalactites hang from the ceiling and are avoided—but where there are stalactites so too are there stalagmites, likely under the waterline. Characters proficient in {@skill Nature} or {@skill Survival} are likely to know that, and you can call a check for it, rather than the players suggesting it.": "钟乳石悬挂在天花板上，需要避开——但是在那里有钟乳石的地方，很可能也有钟乳石柱，可能在水下。擅长{@skill Nature}或{@skill Survival}的角色可能会知道这一点，你可以进行检定，而不是玩家提出建议。",
	"The river takes a sudden turn and the vessel crashes into rocks—not enough to arrest their movement but to overturn the boat. Suggestions include {@skill Athletics} to overpower the momentum or snatch a falling comrade; or {@skill Insight} to predict this fate as the vessel rushes towards the rocks.": "河流突然转弯，船只撞上了岩石——不足以阻止它们的运动，但足以使船翻倒。建议包括用 {@skill Athletics} 来克服动力或抓住掉落的同伴；或者用 {@skill Insight} 来预测船只冲向岩石的命运。",
	"Halaster manifests an illusion of a {@creature hydra|MM}, whose many heads rise up from the waters. The beast opens its maws and acid boils up from its legion throats—but true hydras don't spit acid, and a discerning character can make an {@skill Arcana} or {@skill Nature} check to know that; or an {@skill Investigation} check to see through the Illusion ({@dc 16}). All these checks can be called for by you, rather than be suggested by the players. If characters bail from the boat or attack the {@creature hydra|MM}, they accumulate a failure—for it was all a ruse to distract them from a waterfall that Halaster has cloaked and silenced under an illusion—a waterfall that was otherwise easily navigable given time and effort.": "哈拉斯特(Halaster)显现出一个{@creature hydra|MM}的幻象，它的许多头从水中升起。这个怪兽张开它的口，酸液从它众多的喉咙中涌出——但真正的九头蛇并不会喷酸，一个敏锐的角色可以进行{@skill Arcana}或{@skill Nature}的检定来了解这一点；或者进行{@skill Investigation}的检定来看穿这个幻象((Illusion)). 所有这些检定都可以由你来调用，而不是由玩家建议。如果角色们从船上逃跑或攻击这个{@creature hydra|MM}，他们会积累一个失败——因为这只是一个幌子，是为了转移他们的注意力，让他们不注意哈拉斯特用幻象掩盖和消音的瀑布——这个瀑布在时间和努力下本来是很容易穿越的。",
	"The river spills out into a vast cavern—no, not a cavern but a valley green with life: trees dyed in the autumnal shades of yellow and orange, and brush as thick as a vagrant's hair. You hear birds singing on the wind—yes, that's right, actual wind.": "河流流入一个巨大的洞穴——不，不是一个洞穴，而是一个充满生机的绿色山谷：树木染上了秋天的黄色和橙色，灌木丛像流浪者的头发一样浓密。你听到风中传来鸟儿的歌声——没错，确实是风。",

While Maddgoth is {@condition grappled}, a creature can attempt to take off the helm—an otherwise mundane task exacerbated by Maddgoth's rage, iron will and ego—via a {@dc 16} Strength saving throw. If he is {@condition incapacitated}, it can be taken off, no saving throw required.": "麦戈斯(Maddgoth)的首要任务是从25B区域取回他的头盔，这个头盔让他免疫所有伤害。当麦戈斯处于{@condition grappled}状态时，生物可以尝试摘下头盔——这本来是一项平凡的任务，但由于麦戈斯的愤怒、铁意志和自我，变得更加困难，需要进行{@dc 16}力量豁免检定。如果他处于{@condition incapacitated}状态，头盔可以被摘下，无需进行豁免检定。",
	"Maddgoth never goes anywhere without backup, namely his {@creature homunculus|MM}. If in need of further minions, he releases the {@creature gray slaad|MM} from A33 or the {@creature nycaloth|MM|nycaloths} from A44. These minions remain {@condition invisible} and at a distance until Maddgoth orders them to attack.": "Maddgoth（麦戈斯）从不在没有后备的情况下行动，即他的{@creature homunculus|MM}。如果需要更多的爪牙，他会释放A33的{@creature gray slaad|MM}或A44的{@creature nycaloth|MM|nycaloths}。这些爪牙会保持{@condition invisible}并保持距离，直到麦戈斯下令让他们发动攻击。",
	"Long before entering combat, Maddgoth casts {@spell mage armor} and {@spell mind blank} upon himself.": "在进入战斗之前，Maddgoth对自己施放{@spell mage armor}和{@spell mind blank}。",
	"If combat erupts, Maddgoth casts {@spell time stop} on his first turn. He casts the following spells, if given enough rounds, in the following order of priority: {@spell mirror image}, {@spell fire shield}, {@spell mage armor}, {@spell stoneskin} and, finally, a {@spell cone of cold} spell.": "如果战斗爆发，麦戈斯在他的第一个回合施放{@spell time stop}。如果有足够的回合，他按以下优先顺序施放以下法术：{@spell mirror image}，{@spell fire shield}，{@spell mage armor}，{@spell stoneskin}，最后是一个{@spell cone of cold}法术。",
	"Maddgoth is fond of {@spell detect thoughts} spells to glean insight into his foes' plans.": "Maddgoth喜欢使用{@spell detect thoughts}法术来洞悉他敌人的计划。",
	"When faced with a powerful, single target, Maddgoth casts {@spell banishment}. Thanks to his {@item horned ring|WDMM}, he can bypass Undermountain's restrictions on magic, defenestrating a foe's dumb ass from this plane of existence.": "当面对一个强大的单一目标时，Maddgoth 施放 {@spell banishment}。由于他的 {@item horned ring|WDMM}，他可以绕过安德玛丹的魔法限制，将敌人的蠢货从这个存在平面中抛出。",
	"Provided he still has his {@item horned ring|WDMM}, Maddgoth teleports to safety when he's at 40 hit points or fewer.

	"With infinite {@spell disguise self} and {@spell invisibility} spells at his disposal, Maddgoth makes for a slippery foe.": "拥有无限{@spell disguise self}和{@spell invisibility}法术的马德戈斯(Maddgoth)是一个难以捉摸的敌人。",
	"Khodnar, a LN {@creature mage}, is surprisingly friendly. He's in a good mood, since Maddgoth has promised to research the secrets of lichdom with him. He never suspects Maddgoth's true intention until it's too late. Once the mage realizes that his host intends to murder the guests, Khodnar sides with the party and does his best to escape with them. He isn't prepared to give up his life for strangers, however, and can be deluded by Maddgoth into believing he'll be safe—that it was only these \"trespassers\" that are to be \"punished.\"": "Khodnar，一位LN{@creature mage}，出奇地友好。他心情很好，因为Maddgoth承诺要与他一起研究巫妖的秘密。直到为时已晚，他才意识到Maddgoth的真正意图。一旦这位法师意识到他的主人打算谋害客人，Khodnar就站在了队伍一边，并尽力与他们一起逃脱。然而，他并不准备为陌生人牺牲自己的生命，并且可能被Maddgoth欺骗，相信自己会安全无恙——只是这些“闯入者”才会被“惩罚”。",
	"Maddgoth's Dance unfolds across three acts:": "Maddgoth的舞蹈分为三幕：",
	"Maddgoth returns to his castle to find intruders therein. Ideally, this occurs after the adventurers have discovered the spellbooks in A25, and A31 and A46. A meeting with the {@creature homunculus|MM} and a romp with {@creature Otto|WDMM} is also preferable.": "麦戈斯回到他的城堡发现有入侵者。理想情况是在冒险者发现A25，A31和A46中的咒语书后发生。与{@creature homunculus|MM}的会面和与{@creature Otto|WDMM}的冒险也是可取的。",
	"When Maddgoth arrives, with Khodnar in tow, read:": "当Maddgoth（Maddgoth）和Khodnar（Khodnar）一起到达时，请阅读：",
	"The castle shudders with an unseen force. Soft thunder echoes out from the heart of the courtyard and a pale brilliance lights up the halls for just a moment. Someone's come to the castle. Its master, perhaps?": "城堡因一股看不见的力量而颤抖。轻柔的雷声从庭院的中心回荡，苍白的光辉在大厅中短暂地闪耀。有人来到了城堡。是城堡的主人吗？",
	"Maddgoth's return instantly turns on all the interior lights in the castle (if they aren't on already) as if the middle lever of the Console (see A37) was pulled. The {@creature homunculus|MM} cracks a grin and literally jumps with joy; {@creature Otto|WDMM} cowers in fear like a child whose mother is about to discover the mess he made.": "麦戈斯的回归立即打开了城堡内所有的灯光（如果它们还没有打开），就好像控制台（见A37）的中间杠杆被拉动一样。{@creature homunculus|MM}露出了一个笑容，欣喜若狂地跳了起来；{@creature Otto|WDMM}像一个母亲即将发现他弄脏了东西的孩子一样惊恐地退缩。",
	"The magi arrive in the courtyard (A23), loudly discussing their evening plans. If Maddgoth sees signs of intrusion, he at first casts {@spell mage armor} and {@spell mind blank} on himself, but otherwise doesn't let his surprise show. His ego already at critical mass, he acts with an air of confidence.": "三位魔法师抵达庭院（A23），大声讨论着他们的晚上计划。如果麦戈斯（Maddgoth）发现入侵的迹象，他会首先对自己施放{@spell mage armor}和{@spell mind blank}，但不让自己的惊讶表现出来。他的自负已经达到临界点，他表现出一种自信的姿态。",
	"Even if the adventurers hide from Maddgoth, the {@creature homunculus|MM} betrays their presence with telepathy. When he encounters his uninvited guests, he greets them with a smile. If {@creature Otto|WDMM} is still alive, it immediately flees from Maddgoth—but the wizard skewers it with a {@spell magic missile} spell straight through its eyeball. \"That pest has been squatting here for months. Try as I might, it never did listen to me,\" he says.": "即使冒险者们躲避{@creature homunculus|MM}，{@creature homunculus|MM} 通过心灵感应泄露了他们的位置。当他遇到这些不速之客时，他微笑着向他们打招呼。如果{@creature Otto|WDMM} 仍然活着，它立刻逃离了{@creature homunculus|MM}——但巫师用{@spell magic missile} 法术直接刺穿了它的眼球。\"那个讨厌的家伙已经在这里蹲了几个月了。无论我怎么努力，它从来没有听我的话，\"他说。",
	"Having met the adventurers, Maddgoth insists they stay for dinner—and he refuses to take no for an answer. Dinner quickly becomes staying the night as the killer's ego gets the better of him. This, Maddgoth is convinced, is his magnum opus. By midnight, he'll have slain all his victims. As insurance, he poisons tonight's wine with {@item Midnight Tears|DMG} poison (see above). He has five doses of antidote and is unconcerned if he also ingests the poison.": "在与冒险者见面后，麦戈斯坚持让他们留下来吃晚餐——他拒绝接受拒绝。晚餐很快变成留宿一晚，因为杀手的自负占了上风。麦戈斯坚信这是他的杰作。到午夜，他将会杀死所有的受害者。为了保险起见，他在今晚的葡萄酒中投放了{@item Midnight Tears|DMG}毒药（见上文）。他有五剂解药，如果他也误服毒药，他并不担心。",
	"Maddgoth gives the party an hour to freshen up—but this is just to cover his antics. First, he frees the {@creature gray slaad|MM} from A33 and retrieves the poison from A45. Thereafter, he can be found in the kitchen, A27B, guiding his {@creature Living Unseen Servant|WDMM|living unseen servants} as they prepare tonight's meal. If uninterrupted, he poisons the wine through an intricate conjuration spell (see A27 for details) which costs him a 2nd-level spell slot. It's advised you have at least one adventurer run into him in the kitchen to foreshadow this.": "麦戈斯给了队伍一个小时的时间让他们休整——但这只是为了掩盖他的花招。首先，他从A33中解救出{@creature gray slaad|MM}，并从A45处取回毒药。之后，他会在厨房A27B里，指导他的{@creature Living Unseen Servant|WDMM|living unseen servants}们准备今晚的晚餐。如果没有打扰，他会通过一个复杂的魔法咒语（详见A27）来给酒中下毒，这需要他消耗一个2级法术位。建议至少让一名冒险者在厨房里碰到他，为此提前铺垫。",
	"Maddgoth sends his {@creature homunculus|MM} to gather his guests and bring them to A27A. If he couldn't poison their wine earlier, Maddgoth may cast {@spell time stop} to do so now with the same spell he would've used earlier. During dinner, he plays with his food, and asks the adventurers probing questions or suggests feats of daring and high-stakes wagers.": "麦戈斯派遣他的{@creature homunculus|MM}去邀请客人并将他们带到A27A。如果他之前无法毒害他们的酒，麦戈斯可能会施放{@spell time stop}来使用同样的法术。在晚宴期间，他玩弄食物，向冒险者提出探询性问题或建议大胆的壮举和高赌注。",
	"Assuming his guests consume the poison, Maddgoth suggests watching an \"operatic illusion.\" It's the highlights reel of his scarlet career. See Area 46.": "假设他的客人们都服下毒药，麦戈斯建议观看一场“歌剧幻象”。这是他猩红生涯的精华片段。请查看46区域。",
	"Maddgoth insists the guests stay the night and has his {@creature Living Unseen Servant|WDMM|living unseen servants} prepare the guest rooms (A29–32). If the party refuses to stay, he pretends to not be bothered. He soon excuses himself to A37 and locks down the castle (see A37, \"Button 4\" for details).": "Maddgoth坚持让客人过夜，并让他的仆人们准备客房（A29–32）。如果冒险小组拒绝留下，他会假装不在意。他很快找借口离开到A37，并锁定了城堡（详情请参见A37，“Button 4”）。",
	"If the adventurers agree to stay, Maddgoth bides his time until 10 minutes before midnight when he launches his attack. The serial killer would much rather murder any spellcasters in a duel and leave the mundane guests to die to poison. He'll even go as far as waking any sleeping spellcasters. He stations his minions (the {@creature gray slaad|MM} and two {@creature nycaloth|MM|nycaloths}) outside other rooms while his {@creature homunculus|MM} roams the hall, lending its strength wherever necessary. See A29–32 for details.": "如果冒险者同意留下，麦戈斯会等待时机，直到午夜前10分钟发动攻击。这位连环杀手更愿意在决斗中杀死任何法术施展者，让普通客人死于毒药。他甚至会唤醒任何正在睡觉的法术施展者。他会让手下的手下（{@creature gray slaad|MM} 和两个 {@creature nycaloth|MM|nycaloths}）驻守其他房间外，而他的 {@creature homunculus|MM} 则在大厅里游荡，必要时提供力量。详情请参阅A29–32。",
	"If this ploy goes poorly, Maddgoth has but one contingency plan: a {@creature living unseen servant|WDMM} in A37 that presses the button to teleport all inhabitants to the castle's rooftop, A47. It's here that Maddgoth makes his last stand before dying or fleeing.": "如果这个计谋失败了，Maddgoth 只有一个应急计划：在 A37 中有一个 {@creature living unseen servant|WDMM}，按下按钮将所有居民传送到城堡屋顶，A47。就在这里，Maddgoth 在临死或逃跑前做最后的抵抗。",
	"This level's factions suffer from a disconnect. What occurs in Maddgoth's Castle has nothing to do with the {@creature stone giant|MM|stone giants} and vice versa. Assuming the adventurers don't murder the giants on sight, their only contribution to the campaign is to once again demonstrate how screwed up Halaster is. Without any tie-in to the castle, their only value to the players are as passerby—and that assumes that the adventurers actually speak {@language Giant|PHB}.": "这个级别的派系存在脱节。马德戈斯城堡发生的事情与{@creature stone giant|MM|stone giants}毫无关系，反之亦然。假设冒险者们不是一见到巨人就杀掉他们，他们对冒险的唯一贡献就是再次展示哈拉斯特有多么疯狂。如果没有与城堡的联系，他们对玩家的唯一价值就是过客——这还假设冒险者们真的会说{@language Giant|PHB}。",
	"It truly is astounding that none of this level's inhabitants speak {@language Common|PHB}. If you want to hand-wave this language barrier, then Halaster has enchanted these caverns with a {@spell comprehend languages} spell, allowing all creatures to understand each other. This magic does not extend to Maddgoth's castle, however.": "真是令人惊讶，这个层级的居民竟然没有人会说{@language Common|PHB}。如果你想要忽略这种语言障碍，那么哈拉斯特（Halaster）已经用{@spell comprehend languages}咒语给这些洞穴施加了魔法，使所有生物能够彼此理解。然而，这种魔法并不延伸到麦戈斯（Maddgoth）的城堡。",

	"Ghnorsh's rotting corpse can be found in a caved-in cavern between Areas 9 and 13. Beside him are the crushed corpses of two adventurers. The cave-in has made it impossible for the giants to enter and they've forgotten why they had to clear such rubble.

Fearing that his first victim will be a screamer or alert their fellows by magic, Maddgoth stations his minions outside the other rooms (the {@creature gray slaad|MM} and the two {@creature nycaloth|MM|nycaloths}). His {@creature homunculus|MM} roams around the hall, ready to lend its strength where necessary. It can communicate with Maddgoth via its Telepathic Bond feature. Once all forces are ready, he attacks. Maddgoth has the antidote on his person.": "如果冒险者留宿一晚，他们会发现自己被分配到四间客房中（当时区域31的尸体已被移走并房间已清理干净）。 Maddgoth 担心他的第一个受害者会尖叫或通过魔法警告同伴，因此他让手下守在其他房间外（{@creature gray slaad|MM} 和两个{@creature nycaloth|MM|nycaloths}）。他的{@creature homunculus|MM}在大厅里四处巡逻，随时准备提供必要的支援。它可以通过心灵感应的特性与Maddgoth进行沟通。一旦所有力量准备就绪，他就会发动攻击。Maddgoth身上携带着解药。",

	"You have a few options on how to run this encounter. It would be more beneficial to Maddgoth's Dance if \"Zartem\" didn't attack the adventurers, thus preserving his life until the slaad is needed as extra muscle for the {@creature archmage|MM}.

The slaad hits-and-runs until Maddgoth arrives.": "你有几种选项来进行这次遭遇。如果“扎尔坦(Zartem)”不攻击冒险者，保留他的生命直到需要作为{@creature archmage|MM}的额外力量时，对“玛德高斯之舞(Maddgoth's Dance)”会更有利。另一种选择是它攻击冒险者，受伤后逃跑，依靠其再生特性来治愈伤口。邪龙蛙(slaad)进行打击-撤退，直到玛德高斯到来。",
	"If \"Zartem\" holds back, it instead tries to score sympathy with the adventurers. It's forbidden to leave the castle by Maddgoth (who has its control gem).

The adventurers will learn again why they ought not trust anyone.": "如果\"Zartem\"不离开城堡，Maddgoth及时回来邀请冒险者留下来吃晚餐。Zartem随后成为另一位客人，随时准备帮助Maddgoth。当斯莱德发动第一次攻击时，它脱去伪装，展现出真实的外表和本质。冒险者将再次了解到他们为什么不应该相信任何人。",
	"Adjust Maddgoth's Dance accordingly to account for this additional guest. However, as the creature lacks immunity or even resistance to poison damage, it's loathe to drink the {@condition poisoned} wine (see Area 27).

	"As described in A37, turning the castle's interior lights on allows the giants to see it. Qurrok hurls boulders, some of which land on the rooftop. The boulders are still shrunk by magic, but their momentum is preserved, and the attack deals its normal damage (using the {@creature stone giant|MM|stone giant's} Rock attack). Pick a random area for the boulder to land, subjecting one creature in that space to its effects.

Now both House Freth and Auvryndar must contend with the beast; too many have strayed into its cavern only to never return. The beast has grown bolder in recent days and is now exploring deeper parts of the warrens and preying upon the {@creature drow|MM}.": "他们错了。{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 对除了自己以外的任何事物都没有忠诚，并将这段文字变成了自己的（见第7区）。现在弗雷斯伯爵家和奥维恩达家都必须与这个野兽抗衡；太多人误入它的洞穴后再也没有回来。这只野兽最近变得更加大胆，现在正在探索更深的地下通道，并捕食{@creature drow|MM}。",
	"The {@creature balhannoth|MTF} possesses a dim, but alien, mind. It has an Intelligence score of 6 but also telepathy out to a mile. So, when the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} makes telepathic contact, it doesn't exactly say anything, but instead... audibly slavers and pants. This is an uncomfortable experience. Its attention is hot, like the sun, but uninviting. They can feel its desperate want, like a stray dog hungering for the scraps in your hand. It has no eyes, but its gaze is no less piercing. The beast is perpetually moist and telepathic interactions with it leave someone feeling greasy and unclean. They should come away feeling as if they're the meat on display in a deli.": "{@creature balhannoth|MTF}拥有一颗昏暗而异样的心灵。它的智力值为6，但也具有一英里范围的心灵感应能力。因此，当{@creature balhannoth|MTF}进行心灵接触时，它并不会说任何话，而是发出口水和喘息的声音。这是一种令人不适的体验。它的注意力炽热如太阳，但并不友好。他们能感受到它迫切的渴望，就像一只流浪狗渴望你手中的残羹剩饭。它没有眼睛，但它的凝视同样锐利。这只野兽总是湿漉漉的，与它进行心灵互动会让人感觉油腻和不洁净。他们应该感觉自己就像是在熟食店里展示的肉。",
	"Use these glowing descriptions for whenever the beast telepathically contacts an adventurer. You don't need words to creep your players out. Frequent contact with the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} is sure to drive a man mad—which is what happened to Orl in A8.": "每当野兽以心灵感应方式联系冒险者时，请使用这些发光的描述。你无需言语就能让玩家感到毛骨悚然。频繁接触{@creature balhannoth|MTF}肯定会让一个人发疯—就像A8中的奥尔那样。",
	"The {@creature balhannoth|MTF} is an otherworldly, apex predator. Area 7 counts as its lair, granting it Lair Actions. \"LA\" refers to its Legendary Actions. It uses the following tactics in and out of combat:": "{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 是一个来自异世界的顶级捕食者。第7区被视为它的巢穴，使其获得巢穴行动。\"LA\"指的是它的传奇行动。它在战斗内外使用以下战术：",
	"Like the {@creature behir|MM}, hurl the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} directly at the party twice before it retreats to its lair; it can still prey on the {@creature drow|MM} and {@creature troglodyte|MM|troglodytes} in the meantime.": "就像{@creature behir|MM}一样，直接向冒险小组投掷{@creature balhannoth|MTF}两次，然后才撤退到它的巢穴；在此期间，它仍然可以捕食{@creature drow|MM}和{@creature troglodyte|MM|troglodytes}。",
	"Once the party enters the warrens, the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} probes their minds to determine their greatest desire involving a place; it then reshapes its lair to fit these criteria. See its Lair actions for details.": "一旦队伍进入地道，{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 探查他们的思想，确定他们与某个地方有关的最大愿望；然后重新塑造它的巢穴以符合这些标准。有关详细信息，请参阅其巢穴行动。",
	"The {@creature balhannoth|MTF} has {@sense blindsight} out to a radius of five hundred feet—it can detect anything, that eyeless freak.": "{@creature balhannoth|MTF}已经扩散到五百英尺的半径范围内—它可以探测到任何东西，那个无眼怪物。",
	"When faced with the entire party, the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} knows to strike hard and fast: it teleports above the party while {@condition invisible}; it utilizes the advantage on its first attack by targeting the most armored adventurer; thereafter, it makes another three tentacle attacks. It uses a LA to bite the most vulnerable character.": "当面对整个队伍时，{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 知道要快速而猛烈地攻击：它会在队伍上方传送，同时{@condition invisible}；在第一次攻击中利用优势，瞄准最有装甲的冒险者；然后，进行另外三次触手攻击。它会利用一次攻击来咬最脆弱的角色。",
	"When prey escape its grasp, the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} uses its Vanish LA to flee and set up another ambush. Likewise, it runs down prey with its Teleport LA.": "当猎物逃脱它的控制时，{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 使用它的消失（Vanish）LA 逃跑并设立另一个伏击。同样地，它用传送（Teleport）LA 追捕猎物。",
	"As a predator, the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} cares only to snatch up one character and escape with its meal, utilizing its Teleport LA to do so. It can easily outpace most characters. Gaining altitude is more important than gaining lateral distance so that any pursuers must fly, and any prey are faced with a steep drop if they untangle themselves from the {@creature balhannoth|MTF}.": "作为捕食者，{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 只关心抓住一个角色并带着食物逃走，利用其传送生物能力来做到这一点。它可以轻松地超越大多数角色。获得高度比获得横向距离更重要，这样任何追赶者都必须飞行，而任何猎物如果从{@creature balhannoth|MTF}中解脱出来，将面临陡峭的下坡。",
	"As its lair actions aren't especially useful in combat, the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} is willing to stray from its lair once the party has shattered its illusion; it prefers to go to Area 5 so that it can {@action grapple|PHB} a character and teleport to above the sinkhole (which is a 60-foot drop from the ceiling).": "由于它的巢穴动作在战斗中并不特别有用，{@creature balhannoth|MTF}一旦被队伍打破了幻象，就愿意离开巢穴；它更喜欢前往5区，这样它就可以{@action grapple|PHB}一个角色并传送到洞穴上方（距离天花板有60英尺的下沉洞）。",
	"If the party never slew Illuun the {@creature aboleth|MM} (Hell, even if they did) on Level 4, you could replace the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} featured in this supplement with Illuun. Adjust accordingly, flooding the same caverns that the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} lairs in. Illuun has enslaved most {@creature troll|MM|trolls} and many {@creature troglodyte|MM|troglodytes} to its will. It also has {@dice 1d4 + 3} {@creature chuul|MM|chuuls} under its sway.": "如果队伍从未在4级击败{@creature aboleth|MM}伊鲁恩（甚至如果他们这样做了），你可以用伊鲁恩替换本补充中的{@creature balhannoth|MTF}。相应调整，淹没{@creature balhannoth|MTF}所在的同一洞穴。伊鲁恩奴役了大多数{@creature troll|MM|trolls}和许多{@creature troglodyte|MM|troglodytes}。它还控制着{@dice 1d4 + 3} {@creature chuul|MM|chuuls}。",
	"The {@creature behir|MM} is still a factor in Level 11. It lairs in Area 17 and storms throughout the warrens; unlike in WDMM, it should be encountered before the party reaches Area 17; hurl the {@creature behir|MM} at them once or twice and have it flee when reduced by a quarter of its hit points each time.": "{@creature behir|MM} 在11级仍然是一个因素。它位于17区，横扫整个地下迷宫；与WDMM中不同的是，它应该在队伍到达17区之前就遭遇到；每次将 {@creature behir|MM} 投向他们一两次，当其生命值减少四分之一时让它逃走。",
	"Use the {@creature behir|MM} to disrupt the party's plans and keep them moving. There shall be no respite in these dirty warrens so long as it and the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} live.": "利用{@creature behir|MM}来打乱派对的计划并让他们继续前进。只要{@creature balhannoth|MTF}还在，这些肮脏的地下通道就不会给他们任何喘息的机会。",
	"In combat, the {@creature behir|MM} employs these tactics:": "在战斗中，{@creature behir|MM} 使用以下战术：",
	"The {@creature behir|MM} is an ambusher, especially with the runes that Halaster has engraved upon it. It casts {@spell invisibility} as it approaches its prey and then {@spell misty step} to close the gap, if necessary (ending the {@spell invisibility} spell).": "这个{@creature behir|MM}是一个伏击者，尤其是带有哈拉斯特刻在上面的符文。它在接近猎物时施放{@spell invisibility}，然后在必要时施放{@spell misty step}来缩小距离（结束{@spell invisibility}法术）。",
	"Whether its target is alone or with allies, the {@creature behir|MM} casts {@spell sleep}; it has advantage on its next attack roll, which is a critical hit if the {@creature behir|MM} attacks from within 5 ft. It might also bake the target with its Lightning Breath, whose Dexterity saving throw they automatically fail while {@condition unconscious}.": "无论目标是独自一人还是与盟友一起，{@creature behir|MM}施放{@spell sleep}; 它在下一次攻击投掷中获得优势，如果{@creature behir|MM}在5英尺内进行攻击，则为暴击。它还可以用闪电吐息烤焦目标，其敏捷豁免投掷在{@condition unconscious}期间自动失败。",
	"Targets that aren't put asleep are then {@condition blinded} by a {@spell color spray} spell; the {@creature behir|MM} then gains advantage on attack rolls against these targets.": "没有被使眠的目标随后被{@condition blinded}咒语影响；然后施法者获得对这些目标的攻击投掷有利的优势。",
	"Once the {@creature behir|MM} has constricted and swallowed a target, it flees, using its legendary actions to inhibit the party and escape. If it has its way, it finds a winding crevasse 40 feet up in the cavern and goes 70 feet deep. Creatures that dare clamber into the crevasse are punished with a Lightning Breath.": "一旦{@creature behir|MM}约束并吞噬了目标，它会逃走，利用其传奇动作来阻碍队伍并逃跑。如果它得逞，它会找到一个在洞穴中40英尺高处并且深达70英尺的蜿蜒裂缝。那些敢于爬进裂缝的生物会受到闪电吐息的惩罚。",
	"The minutes swell into hours as you clamber down from {@creature Muiral|WDMM|Muiral's} Gauntlet. Every loose stone you've disturbed has kicked up a whisper, \"The warrens.\" You've heard that damned whisper a thousand times by now: the warrens, the warrens, the bloody warrens.": "当你从{@creature Muiral|WDMM|Muiral's} Gauntlet攀爬下来时，分钟变成了小时。每一块你踢动的松散石头都掀起了一个耳语，“地道”。你现在已经听到了那该死的耳语一千次了：地道，地道，该死的地道。",
	"It takes {@dice 1d3} hours for the adventurers to descend from Level 10; the path is treacherous. When they arrive, it's moments before the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} attacks. It's necessary to showcase the creature this early in the level to set the tone and warn the party that it can teleport and prefers to ambush lone prey.": "冒险者们从10级下降需要{@dice 1d3}小时；路径充满危险。当他们到达时，就在{@creature balhannoth|MTF}发动攻击前的片刻。在这个层次的早期展示这种生物是必要的，以营造氛围并警告队伍，它可以传送并更喜欢伏击孤独的猎物。",
	"The {@creature drow|MM} are too blitzed by a recent attack by the creature to attack the party. Instead, the party overhears this conversation in {@language Elvish|PHB}:": "{@creature drow|MM}被生物最近的袭击搞得晕头转向，无法对队伍发动攻击。相反，队伍在{@language Elvish|PHB}听到了这段对话：",
	"Overheard {@language Elvish|PHB} alerts you to the {@creature drow|MM}; they aren't trying to hide, clearly. Their voices are swollen with terror:": "突然听到{@language Elvish|PHB}的警报让你意识到{@creature drow|MM}；他们并没有试图隐藏，显然。他们的声音充满了恐惧：",
	"\"—I saw it, I swear I saw it.\"": "“—我看到了，我发誓我看到了。”",
	"\"Impossible,\" replies a woman, \"it's never strayed this far from its lair. It must have been a {@creature troll|MM} that got X'erek.\"": "“不可能的，”一位女性回答道，“它从来没有远离巢穴。 必须是{@creature troll|MM}让 X'erek 遭殃。”",
	"\"I know what I bloody saw, Ventrid and it's—\"": "“我知道我见到了什么，文特里德，这是—”",
	"You wince at the ring of a metal gauntlet striking flesh. The male cries out in pain.": "你因为金属铁手套击中肉体的声音而畏缩。那名男性发出痛苦的呼喊。",
	"\"You'll do well,\" this Ventrid says, \"to address your betters with respect, you mewling cur. The {@creature balhannoth|MTF} is ours and ours alone. Return to your post—all of you!\"": "“你们会做得很好，”这位文特里德(Ventrid)说道，“要尊重你们的上级，你这只可怜的家伙。{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 是我们的，只属于我们。回到岗位去，你们所有人！”"
