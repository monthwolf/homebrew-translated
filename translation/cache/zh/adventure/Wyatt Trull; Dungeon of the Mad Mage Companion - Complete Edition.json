	"provides details for effects that occur multiple times throughout Undermountain, such as a repeated trap or hazard, like madness or extreme heat.": "提供在地下山脉(Undermountain)中多次出现的效果的细节，比如重复出现的陷阱或危险，比如疯狂或极端高温。",
	"The {@i Companion} is predicated on one simple, but wide-reaching change to the module: that the adventurers are the unwitting contestants of Halaster's hit, transplanar game show, {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}. This theme paints Halaster as a deranged game show host obsessed with ratings, performance, and, ultimately, his murder at the hands of the adventurers on \"live TV.\" This variant is referred to as {@i Halaster's Game} and provides frequent changes to the campaign.": "这个{@i Companion}是基于对模组的一个简单但影响广泛的改变：冒险者们是哈拉斯特的跨平面热门游戏节目{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}的无意参赛者。这个主题将哈拉斯特描绘成一个疯狂的游戏节目主持人，痴迷于收视率、表现，最终在“直播节目”中被冒险者们谋杀。这个变体被称为{@i Halaster's Game}，并为战役提供频繁的变化。",
	"This chapter focuses on Halaster himself, whether you use this variant or not. You can use the tips provided here to better portray the Mad Mage—who should be heavily featured during the campaign, not left to collect dust in his tower.": "这一章主要关注哈拉斯特本人，无论您是否使用这个变体。您可以使用这里提供的建议来更好地描绘这位疯狂法师——他应该在整个冒险中扮演重要角色，而不是被遗弃在他的塔楼中。",
	"Additionally, this chapter provides an overview of Undermountain, as well as additional hazards and rules you can use throughout the campaign.": "此外，本章节提供了对(安德玛丘)的概述，以及在整个冒险中可以使用的额外危险和规则。",
	"The Mad Mage himself is easily the greatest facet of this adventure and providing him face-time is what will make WDMM memorable for your players.": "疯狂法师本人很容易成为这次冒险中最重要的亮点，给他足够的出场时间将使《疯狂法师的迷宫》对你的玩家难以忘怀。",
	"In the {@i Companion}, Halaster is rewritten as a deranged game show host whose program, {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}, is apparently broadcast across the multiverse. Every season, he selects an adventuring party as his \"contestants\" and challenges them to delve deeper into Undermountain. Those that can best the dungeon's horrors will find gold, glory, and power—and perhaps even freedom from his demented game.": "在{@i Companion}中，Halaster被改写为一个疯狂的游戏节目主持人，他的节目{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}显然在多元宇宙中播出。每个赛季，他会选择一个冒险小队作为他的“参赛者”，并挑战他们深入地下山。那些能够战胜地牢的恐怖将会找到黄金、荣耀和力量——甚至可能摆脱他疯狂游戏的自由。",
	"Halaster can speak telepathically to just about any creature in Undermountain, so long as he's aware of their presence. He uses this power to irk the contestants and other characters—or to speak directly to the \"audience\" of the show. Often, he'll screw with the contestants by including them in these messages, foreshadowing horrors to come or taunting their failures. His cryptic or hilariously vague whispers are equally insufferable and unhelpful to the party.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）可以通过心灵感应与地下城（Undermountain）中几乎任何生物交流，只要他意识到它们的存在。他利用这种能力来刺激参赛者和其他角色，或者直接与节目的“观众”交谈。通常，他会通过包括参赛者在内的这些消息来捉弄他们，预示即将发生的恐怖，或者嘲讽他们的失败。他那神秘或滑稽模棱两可的耳语对于队伍来说同样令人难以忍受且毫无帮助。",
	"Halaster views himself as something akin to a deity, and as such, has reached a point of pride that consumes many all-powerful beings. To sink down to a lesser foe's level is an insult to Halaster's ego. So, while he could very well crush enemies like the {@creature lich|MM} {@creature Ezzat|WDMM}, it's beneath him to try. Like all other near-omnipotent beings, his is a game of cat-and-mouse. His minions, or the contestants of {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}, are pawns to be moved across a chessboard.": "哈拉斯特(Halaster)视自己为类似于神明的存在，因此，他已经达到了一种自负的程度，这种自负吞噬了许多全能的存在。下降到一个较弱敌人的水平对哈拉斯特的自我是一种侮辱。因此，虽然他完全有能力粉碎像{@creature lich|MM} {@creature Ezzat|WDMM} 这样的敌人，但尝试这样做对他来说是卑微的。像所有其他几乎全能的存在一样，他的行为就像是一场猫鼠游戏。他的手下，或者{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}的参与者，只是棋盘上的棋子。",
	"Many, even his apprentices, believe that Halaster's madness is owed to the Knot in the Weave, to Undermountain. The truth is far more tragic: the Mad Mage cannot ever die—and he knows it. The ecstasy he felt after his first rebirth is now just a bitter memory, a seed that has born strange fruit. This grim reality, of weathering all eternity, shattered Halaster's mind—and in the ruins of his sanity he has found comfort in madness.": "许多人，甚至他的学徒，都认为哈拉斯特（Halaster）的疯狂是由于编织之结（the Knot in the Weave），由于安德山（Undermountain）。事实要悲剧得多：这位疯狂法师永远无法死去——而他知道这一点。在第一次重生后他感受到的狂喜如今只是一个痛苦的记忆，一个结出了奇异果实的种子。这残酷的现实，经受永恒的折磨，粉碎了哈拉斯特的心智——在他精神的废墟中，他找到了疯狂中的慰藉。",
	"The adventurers' first run-in with the Mad Mage sets the tone for the entire campaign. You can't simply hurl him at the party. Instead, allow the upper reaches of Undermountain, namely L1, to demonstrate the cruelty and insanity of its host.": "冒险者们与疯狂法师的首次冲突为整个冒险活动设定了基调。你不能简单地将他投向队伍。相反，让安德山的上层区域，即L1，展示其主人的残忍和疯狂。",
	"Neither do you just want to announce that the adventurers are contestants in some crazed game; Halaster doesn't just appear and lay out the rules or declare them as his unfortunate play-things. They merely learn that they {@i already are} and the question of \"Why us?\" should forever haunt them.": "你也不只是想宣布冒险者们是某种疯狂游戏的参赛者；Halaster不会突然出现并宣布规则或宣称他们是他不幸的玩物。他们只是得知他们{@i already are}，而“为什么是我们？”这个问题应该会永远困扰着他们。",
	"The unknown is truly the scariest thing for the human mind to comprehend; therefore, you don't want to overdo it with Halaster's appearances. Foreshadowing, such as his booming laughter or his {@spell arcane eye}, serve aplenty. For L1, you ought to do your best to steer your players towards A27, the Hidden Demiplane. This should serve as your player's first encounter with the Mad Mage. This encounter is the most important one for the first several levels of Undermountain.": "未知对人类思维来说确实是最可怕的事物；因此，你不希望过度使用哈拉斯特（Halaster）的出现。预示，比如他的响亮笑声或者他的{@spell arcane eye}，足够多了。对于L1，你应该尽力引导玩家前往A27，隐藏的半位面。这应该作为玩家与疯狂法师的第一次相遇。这次遭遇是地下山的前几级中最重要的之一。",
	"No matter how deranged Halaster has grown, he's still a person. He still has a heart—and it beats for a select few. Demonstrate Halaster's tattered humanity through these individuals. Nothing wounds him more than being scorned by someone he trusts and loves; such a wound never heals, never scabs over, but just bleeds and bleeds.": "无论哈拉斯特(Halaster)变得多么疯狂，他仍然是一个人。他仍然有一颗心—而这颗心只为少数人跳动。通过这些个体展示哈拉斯特那破碎的人性。没有什么比被自己信任和爱的人蔑视更伤害他；这样的伤口永远不会愈合，永远不会结痂，只会不断地流血。",
	"Skullport's senior mage is often visited by Halaster—for tea, of all things. Of all his attachments, \"Tas\" is the only one he does not want to show his true colors to. Her opinion alone can wound the Mad Mage. Criminals, hooligans, and adventurers risk their own doom by threatening her. When together, the two act like an old married couple. See Skullport, Area 27 for details on Tas.": "骷髅港的资深法师经常受到哈拉斯特的拜访——居然是为了喝茶。在他所有的交往中，“Tas”是唯一一个他不想展示真实面目的人。她的看法可以伤害这位疯狂法师。罪犯、流氓和冒险家们冒着自己的命运危险来威胁她。当他们在一起时，这两人就像一对老夫老妻。有关Tas的详细信息，请参阅骷髅港，第27区。",
	"Halaster has quite the complicated history with the {@creature archdruid|VGM} of L5. Some part friend and some part daughter, the Mad Mage cherishes her. He cannot imagine a future without her in his dungeon—and so he'll never let her go. For her part, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} is conflicted; given all he's done for her and {@i to} her, she can't simply hate Halaster. Undermountain is both her home and her prison—just as it is for him.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）与L5的{@creature archdruid|VGM}有着相当复杂的历史。作为朋友的一部分，作为女儿的一部分，疯狂法师珍视着她。他无法想象没有她在他的地牢里的未来—因此他永远不会放手。至于{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}，她心情复杂；考虑到他为她做过的一切，以及{@i to}，她不能简单地恨哈拉斯特。地下山（Undermountain）既是她的家园，也是她的监狱—就像对他而言一样。",
	"Somehow, Halaster still has a fondness for the Seven, even if only out of nostalgia. Together, they're all one big, miserable, dysfunctional family unable to part ways. Although they appear quite infrequently, consider the following details about the surviving Seven and their relationships with their master:": "一些奇怪的是，哈拉斯特(Halaster) 仍然对七位学徒有一种喜爱，即使只是出于怀旧。他们一起组成了一个庞大、悲惨、功能失调的家庭，无法分道扬镳。尽管他们出现得相当少，但考虑以下关于幸存的七位学徒及他们与主人的关系的细节：",
	"Older Undermountain modules implied that {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} was in love with Halaster. This love, however, is unrequited—and that truth has cut her deep.": "旧版《地下山脉》模组暗示{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}爱上了哈拉斯特。然而，这份爱情是单相思的——这个事实深深伤害了她。",
	"Older Undermountain modules implied that {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} sought to overthrow Halaster. In L23, the {@i Companion} paints him as a would-be usurper perpetually denied his moment to strike. Additionally, it adds that he (unrequitedly) loves {@creature Arcturia|WDMM}; knowing the feelings she harbors for him fans the flames of his own treachery and resentment.": "旧版《地下山谷》模组暗示{@creature Trobriand|WDMM}试图推翻哈拉斯特。在L23中，{@i Companion}将他描绘成一个一直被剥夺机会的意图篡位者。此外，它还提到他（单相思地）爱着{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}；知道她对他怀有的感情煽动了他自己的背叛和怨恨之情。",
	"{@creature Marambra Nyghtsteel|WDMMC} was, per statements by the authors of WDMM, purposely left out of the module so that the DM can use her as he sees fit. The {@i Companion} includes her on L23.": "{@creature Marambra Nyghtsteel|WDMMC}根据WDMM的作者的说法，是故意在模块中留出的，以便DM可以根据自己的意愿使用她。{@i Companion}在L23上包括了她。",
	"{@creature Nester|WDMM}, who failed to achieve lichdom, teaches necromancy on L9. In WDMM he exists as a failed {@creature lich|MM}; the {@i Companion} instead turns him into a {@creature boneclaw|MTF} (see MTF) that must now serve Halaster. Until the Mad Mage is dead (no small feat, that), {@creature Nester|WDMM} cannot die, nor disobey. Despite his chains, {@creature Nester|WDMM} harbors no resentment to his master. He has since found much sadistic joy in torturing Dweomercore students.": "{@creature Nester|WDMM}，一个未能成功成为巫妖的人，在L9教授死灵术。在WDMM中，他作为一个失败的{@creature lich|MM}存在；{@i Companion}反而将他变成了一个{@creature boneclaw|MTF}（见MTF），现在必须侍奉哈拉斯特。在疯狂法师死去之前（这可不是小事），{@creature Nester|WDMM}不能死亡，也不能违抗。尽管被束缚，{@creature Nester|WDMM}对他的主人没有任何怨恨。他自那时起就发现了在折磨Dweomercore学生中找到了很多变态的快乐。",
	"{@creature Muiral|WDMM} blames his disfigurement—hell, his whole mess of a life—on Halaster. He not only detests the Mad Mage but is {@i terrified} of him. Years of isolation have done little for his already frayed sanity, and {@creature Muiral|WDMM} has since equated Halaster to a boogeyman. The kicker? {@creature Muiral|WDMM} considers his self-disfigurement a necessary measure to {@i thwart} his master's \"influence\" over his will.": "{@creature Muiral|WDMM} 将他的毁容——甚至整个混乱不堪的生活——归咎于哈拉斯特(Halaster)。他不仅憎恶这位疯狂法师，而且对他感到恐惧{@i terrified}。多年的孤立对他已经岌岌可危的理智没有什么帮助，{@creature Muiral|WDMM} 自此将哈拉斯特等同于鬼怪。更离谱的是，{@creature Muiral|WDMM} 认为自己的毁容是为了{@i thwart} 他主人对他意志的“影响”而采取的必要措施。",
	"Ultimately, Jhesiyra Kestellharp is the one ghost that keeps Halaster up at night. The one question that hounds him as he works. Her disappearance cut him to his very core—for the Mad Mage has abandonment issues like no other. He scorns her as a deserter, a treacherous daughter. Truly, he's afraid of her and the entire situation.": "最终，杰西拉·凯斯特尔哈普 (Jhesiyra Kestellharp) 是那个让哈拉斯特 (Halaster) 夜不能寐的幽灵。一个问题一直萦绕在他工作时的脑海中。她的失踪深深伤害了他的内心，因为这位疯狂法师拥有空前的被抛弃问题。他鄙视她，认为她是一个背叛者，一个不忠的女儿。实际上，他害怕她和整个情况。",
	"Despite plunging them into this horrid game, Halaster cherishes few others more than his beloved contestants. For them, he'll move the moon—or send it crashing down upon their heads. His idea of challenge is akin to a god pressing their thumb upon the world—walking the fine line between adversity and Armageddon. Should they ever complain about the hardships he visits upon them, he insists it's all to help them realize their \"true potential.\"": "尽管将他们投入这个可怕的游戏，哈拉斯特(Halaster)比他心爱的竞争者更珍视寥寥无几。为了他们，他会移动月亮——或让它坠落在他们头上。他对挑战的理解类似于神将拇指按在世界上——在逆境和末日之间走一条细线。如果他们抱怨他给予他们的困难，他坚持认为这一切都是为了帮助他们实现他们的“真正潜力”。",
	"When running WDMM with Halaster's Game, these goals take precedence over what is written in WDMM's overview chapter. All are active, no matter how deranged Halaster might currently be, and are prioritized in the following order:": "在与哈拉斯特的游戏中运行WDMM时，这些目标优先于WDMM概述章节中的内容。所有这些目标都是活跃的，无论哈拉斯特当前有多疯狂，都按以下顺序优先考虑：",
	"Halaster's foremost goal is to achieve the highest ratings for {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}. Every season (each featuring another adventuring party) is an opportunity for him to hone his craft. He does whatever is necessary to make a perfect season, short of performing a {@i deus ex machina} to save the contestants.": "哈拉斯特(Halaster)的首要目标是为{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}获得最高评分。每个季节(每个都有一个不同的冒险队伍)对他来说是磨练自己技艺的机会。他会尽一切必要的手段来打造一个完美的季节，但不至于进行{@i deus ex machina}来拯救参赛者。",
	"Contestants would be shocked to learn that Halaster is actually {@i rooting} for them. Every season has ended in bitter disappointment and he needs a win. While he won't spare the adventurers, he does not go out of his way to destroy them—not until they finally arrive to his lair on L23.": "参赛者会感到震惊，发现哈拉斯特实际上对他们是{@i rooting}。每个赛季都以痛苦的失望告终，他需要一场胜利。虽然他不会手软对待冒险者，但也不会刻意摧毁他们，直到他们最终抵达他在L23的巢穴。",
	"So seldom has a pupil impressed Halaster that he's always searching for the next—one who might even carry the mantle of \"Mad Mage\" one day. None of his current apprentices suffice, nor do any of the students of Dweomercore. No, Halaster's ideal apprentice is a contestant of {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}, one who bests him in combat.": "很少有学生能给哈拉斯特留下深刻印象，他总是在寻找下一个——也许甚至能有朝一日继承“疯狂法师”称号的人。他当前的学徒都不够格，Dweomercore的学生们也不行。不，哈拉斯特心目中理想的学徒是{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}的参赛者，一个能在战斗中打败他的人。",
	"Halaster prefers wizards as apprentices but will settle for (in this order) sorcerers, bards, and finally warlocks (whom he calls \"cheaters\"). So long as they can perform arcane magic and have a sufficient supply of \"moxie,\" Halaster will welcome them the same way he welcomed all his other apprentices: by putting them through a crucible.": "哈拉斯特更喜欢巫师作为学徒，但会接受（按照顺序）巫术师，诗人，最后是术士（他称之为“作弊者”）。只要他们能施展奥术魔法并具备足够的“胆识”，哈拉斯特将像对待其他学徒一样欢迎他们：让他们经历一场考验。",
	"Ideally, this candidate will prove their worth by besting his current apprentices (including the reluctant candidate {@creature Drivvin Freth|WDMM} of L12), as well as the students in {@adventure Dweomercore|WDMMC|12}.": "理想情况下，这位候选人将通过击败他当前的学徒（包括L12的候选人{@creature Drivvin Freth|WDMM}），以及{@adventure Dweomercore|WDMMC|12}中的学生来证明自己的价值。",
	"As described in WDMM, {@creature Ezzat|WDMM} the {@creature lich|MM} has earned Halaster's ire. To battle the {@creature lich|MM} himself would mean lowering himself to the undead's level, and so the Mad Mage directs adventurers to destroy {@creature Ezzat|WDMM}. See L20.": "正如《WDMM》所描述，{@creature Ezzat|WDMM} {@creature lich|MM} 招致了哈拉斯特的愤怒。与{@creature lich|MM} 本人交战意味着把自己降到不死生物的水平，因此疯狂法师指引冒险者去摧毁{@creature Ezzat|WDMM}。见L20。",
	"As written in WDMM, Halaster has entertained the idea of installing the Shadowdusks of L22 as puppets in control of Waterdeep—if only for the exercise of growing his influence or filming new game shows.": "正如《(WDMM)》所述，哈拉斯特曾考虑过将L22的影暮安装为他在瓦特德普的傀儡，即使只是为了增加他的影响力或拍摄新的游戏节目。",
	"The Mad Mage can tolerate a great many of things and admires many more: desperation, tenacity, stubbornness in the face of adversity. What he cannot abide, however, is pride—and the drow houses Auvryndar and Freth are chock-full of it. His irritation has soured into loathing, and he views them as parasites encroaching upon his domain.": "疯狂法师(Mad Mage)可以容忍许多事情，并钦佩更多：绝望、坚韧、在逆境中的顽强。然而，他无法容忍的是骄傲——而德罗(Drow)家族奥维恩达(Auvryndar)和弗瑞斯(Freth)却充斥着这种骄傲。他的烦恼已经变成了厌恶，他视它们为侵犯他领地的寄生虫。",
	"Halaster would like nothing more than to see them felled by the lowest, meekest, most humble of creatures possible. Thus, it makes a fitting challenge to the contestants of {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）最希望看到他们被最低微、最渺小、最谦卑的生物击倒。因此，这对{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}的参赛者来说是一个合适的挑战。",
	"The githyanki crusade against the mind flayer colony of Seadeeps is an amusing debacle for Halaster. He often films the conflict, hoping to either make a spin-off to {@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage} or a documentary. However, he fears the conflict spiraling out of control and ending too soon. He'd rather keep the conflict alive for years to come so as to have more material.": "吉萨因凯对海深的食脑怪殖民地的十字军东征对哈拉斯特来说是一个有趣的失败。他经常拍摄这场冲突，希望要么制作成{@i Dungeon of the Mad Mage}的衍生作品，要么制作一部纪录片。然而，他担心冲突失控并过早结束。他宁愿让冲突持续多年，以便有更多素材。",
	"The fate of Jhesiyra still hounds Halaster, who considers her disappearance as the blackest of betrayals. The {@i Companion} leaves Jhesiyra's involvement in the campaign up to the DM. See L23 for details on how to include her in the campaign's final chapter.": "杰西拉的命运仍然困扰着哈拉斯特，他认为她的失踪是最严重的背叛。{@i Companion}让杰西拉在冒险中的参与取决于DM。有关如何在冒险的最后一章中包含她的详细信息，请参阅L23。",
	"Halaster's abilities are bound only by your imagination. You have carte blanche, so long as you do not use that to outright slaughter the adventurers. He is conveniently omniscient and nearly omnipotent. He is always surveilling—\"filming\" as he calls it—the adventurers in the form of {@spell arcane eye} and {@spell scrying} spells. Truly, he is the {@i dungeon master} of Undermountain.": "哈拉斯特的能力仅受你的想象力限制。你拥有完全的自由裁量权，只要不用来直接屠杀冒险者。他方便地无所不知，几乎无所不能。他总是在以{@spell arcane eye}和{@spell scrying}法术的形式监视——正如他所称之为的“拍摄”——冒险者。实际上，他是地下山的{@i dungeon master}。",
	"Halaster's list of prepared spells are of no concern to you. With eons of study, he knows literally every wizard spell. Don't be bogged down by what's in his statblock—until, of course, he and the adventurers are embroiled in a true fight, such as in the ultimate chapter of WDMM.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）准备的法术清单对你来说并不重要。通过无数年的研究，他几乎掌握了每一个巫师法术。不要被他的属性表所困扰——直到他和冒险者们卷入真正的战斗，比如在《WDMM》的最终章节中。",

	"Humiliating, betraying, or hurting a dear ally": "羞辱、背叛或伤害亲爱的盟友（dear ally）",
	"Scoring a critical hit against a creature Halaster's indifferent towards or detests": "对哈拉斯特（Halaster）漠视或憎恨的生物进行暴击得分",
	"Feats of daring, including defying death such as by succeeding on a Death saving throw": "大胆的壮举，包括挑战死亡，比如成功通过一次（Death saving throw）的豁免检定。",
	"Puns or other witty jokes": "双关语或其他风趣的笑话",

	"Sparing a foe of Halaster's": "对待哈拉斯特(Halaster)的敌人仁慈",
	"The value of an act is completely arbitrary, but the prices for prizes are fixed. The price in points of a nonmagical item is equal to its cost in gp. When it comes to magical items, the price is determined by rarity: 250 for a Common item, and 500 for Uncommon. Halaster refuses to award anything rarer than that. Any magic item he awards that has charges on it is destroyed upon reaching 0 charges. If a magic item doesn't normally have charges, assume it has 1–3 and is confiscated by Halaster after its use.": "一个行为的价值完全是任意的，但奖品的价格是固定的。非魔法物品的点数价格等于它在gp中的成本。至于魔法物品，价格由稀有度决定：普通物品为250点，不寻常物品为500点。哈拉斯特（Halaster）拒绝奖励任何比这更稀有的东西。他奖励的任何带有充能的魔法物品在充能用尽时被摧毁。如果一个魔法物品通常没有充能，假设它有1-3个充能，在使用后被哈拉斯特没收。",
	"Likewise, wizard spells of up to 2nd-level can be redeemed like {@spell knock} or {@spell enlarge/reduce}. 1st-level spells cost 300 points, and 2nd-level spells 500.

	"The following have been added to Halaster's Regional Effects:": "以下内容已添加到哈拉斯特的区域效应中：",
	"The Mad Mage sends a copy of himself, but not a {@spell simulacrum} per se, to interact with the party.

The Mad Mage knows everything the illusion says, hears, sees, and does.": "疯狂法师派遣了一个自己的分身，但并非一个{@spell simulacrum}本尊，与队伍互动。他可以通过这个幻象看到和说话，或者暂时赋予它足够的自主权和智慧，让它与冒险者交谈，而哈拉斯特忙于其他工作。疯狂法师知道幻象所说、听到、看到和做的一切。",
	"Halaster's madness manifests in a {@spell simulacrum} (created as if by the {@spell simulacrum} spell) which can harass the adventurers in nonlethal ways, such as casting {@spell wall of stone} or {@spell hallucinatory terrain} in their vicinity. The Mad Mage rarely becomes aware of a {@spell simulacrum} but destroys it when he does, fearing that it might one day rival him.": "哈拉斯特的疯狂表现为一个{@spell simulacrum}（仿佛是由{@spell simulacrum}法术创造的），可以以非致命的方式骚扰冒险者，比如在他们附近施放{@spell wall of stone}或{@spell hallucinatory terrain}。这位疯狂法师很少察觉到{@spell simulacrum}，但一旦发现就会摧毁它，担心有一天它可能会与他匹敌。",
	"Whenever you want to speak to your players through Halaster (\"That went well\" or \"Are you sure?\") you can have the Mad Mage telepathically communicate to the party without blowing their cover or revealing their presence to other creatures nearby.": "每当你想通过哈拉斯特 (Halaster) 与你的玩家交谈时（比如“那进展顺利”或“你确定吗？”），你可以让疯狂法师通过心灵感应与队伍沟通，而不会暴露他们的身份或让附近的其他生物察觉到他的存在。",
	"Halaster can randomly show up during combat and use his magic for hilariously, horrifying results—petrifying a {@creature goblin}, or wrenching and animating the {@creature skeleton} from a slain {@creature bugbear} (thus, adding a {@creature skeleton} to the encounter). So powerful is the Mad Mage that he has no initiative and no spells to be bound by—he's bound only by your imagination.": "哈拉斯特(Halaster)可能会在战斗中随机出现，并使用他的魔法带来令人捧腹的、可怕的结果——比如将一个{@creature goblin}石化，或者从被杀死的{@creature bugbear}身上扭曲并赋予生命{@creature skeleton}(从而为遭遇增加一个{@creature skeleton})。疯狂法师的力量如此强大，他没有先攻值，也没有被任何法术所束缚——他只受你的想象力所限制。",
	"A favorite antic of Halaster's is to curse a character with {@sense darkvision} to a life without it. A spell of {@spell remove curse} can restore a character's {@sense darkvision}, otherwise it returns whenever Halaster has grown tired of his prank. Alternatively, he can magically cause {@sense darkvision} to fail in a 100-foot-cubic area of his choosing.": "哈拉斯特(Halaster)最喜欢的恶作剧之一是用{@sense darkvision}诅咒一个角色，使其生活中没有{@sense darkvision}。一个{@spell remove curse}法术可以恢复一个角色的{@sense darkvision}，否则当哈拉斯特厌倦他的恶作剧时，{@sense darkvision}会重新消失。另外，他还可以在他选择的一个100立方英尺的区域内，用魔法使{@sense darkvision}失败。",
	"Halaster shunts the contestants into a demiplane stocked with whatever challenges or horrors he has in mind or teleports them elsewhere. If you want to insert a one-shot, especially any of the adventures written for WDMM by other authors, this is an ideal method to introducing it.": "哈拉斯特将参赛者推入一个半位面，其中充满了他心中想要的挑战或恐怖，或者将他们传送到其他地方。如果你想插入一个单场冒险，尤其是其他作者为《(WDMM)》写的冒险之一，这是引入的理想方法。",
	"Halaster targets a creature, subjecting it to a {@dc 16} Charisma saving throw.

No matter how titanic the conclusion to the events on one level, it's neighbors will hardly be affected.

	"Tracking the illithids of Seadeeps, the githyanki have raided Undermountain and carved out a piece of territory of their own: the Crystalline Labyrinth. After discovering the portal linking Undermountain to Stardock, one of the hollowed-out asteroids of Toril, the githyanki moved the majority of their forces there to create a stronghold and creche (a place where their young can safely age and train outside of the Astral Plane).

	"You can quickly throw together an adventuring party with the following tables.": "您可以使用以下表格快速组建一个冒险队伍。",
	"This adventure is a curious one. It's designed to see adventurers from 5th-level to the mythic fourth tier of play—and yet, since it's all confined in one dungeon, little story can be expected to develop. Further, a high mortality rate can be expected given Undermountain's lack of civilization and overabundant perils.": "这个冒险是一个奇特的冒险。它旨在让冒险者从5级到传奇第四层级的游戏中体验—然而，由于一切都局限在一个地牢中，很少会有故事发展。此外，由于安德瞄地下城缺乏文明且危险重重，可以预期死亡率较高。",
	"A campaign that reaches 17th-level, let alone 20th, is the stuff of dreams for many a player. However, given WDMM's lack of narrative, characters might lack for personal growth unless you, the DM, go out of your way to intertwine the adventurers' personal development with the dungeon or allow them a brief foray to the surface. Several quest hooks are included to alleviate WDMM's inherent flaw.": "许多玩家梦寐以求的是达到17级，更不用说20级了。然而，鉴于《WDMM》缺乏叙事，角色可能缺乏个人成长，除非你作为DM特意将冒险者的个人发展与地牢交织在一起，或者允许他们短暂地前往地表。为缓解《WDMM》固有的缺陷，包含了几个任务钩子。",
	"Despite being advertised as a sequel to Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, this adventure can't be any more different.

If your players are intent on bringing their Dragon Heist characters, don't skimp out on this warning.": "尽管被宣传为《瓦特德普：龙藏富翁》的续集，这个冒险却完全不同。《瓦特德普的龙神之迷》不仅鼓励，而且要求角色在战斗中进行优化，进行地牢探险——而不是为了揭开阴谋并在社交场合表现出色而设计的角色。如果你的玩家坚持要使用他们的《龙藏富翁》角色，不要忽视这个警告。",
	"This adventure is, without all the bells and whistles, a mega-dungeon crawl, harkening back to the ancient days of D&D. While other published 5E adventures do their best to dispel the necessity of having a dedicated healer and a dedicated defender, WDMM essentially requires it. Parties that don't follow this paradigm will find themselves in trouble later.": "这个冒险，简而言之，是一个大型地牢探险，回溯到D&D的古老时代。虽然其他已出版的5版冒险尽力消除需要专门的治疗者和防御者的必要性，但《(WDMM)》基本上要求这样做。不遵循这一范式的队伍将会在后期陷入麻烦。",
	"The adventurers will be hard-pressed to find the time or safety for a long rest. They may often be forced to travel through one or two levels before they can actually rest—they shouldn't expect to begin or finish a new level with the benefit of a long rest. Thus, a party that is overly-reliant on long rests, as opposed to short rests, will struggle while parties with fighters, warlocks, and monks will fare a bit better.": "冒险者们将很难找到时间或安全条件进行长时间休息。他们经常会被迫在能够真正休息之前穿越一到两个层级，他们不应该指望在开始或完成新层级时能够享受长时间休息的好处。因此，一个过分依赖长时间休息而不是短时间休息的队伍将会遇到困难，而拥有战士、术士和武僧的队伍会稍微好一些。",

	"While hardly mentioned, it's more than likely that a few {@creature deep gnome|WDMMC|deep gnomes} eke out a living in Undermountain. One {@creature druid|MM} in particular once tended to a Zurkhwood grove on Level 4 before the {@creature aboleth|MM} Illuun arrived.

	"The bowels of Undermountain teem with {@creature drow|MM} as Houses Freth and Auvryndar duke it out for sovereignty.

	"Since ancient days, the {@creature duergar|MM} have claimed the depths of Undermountain as their own. Their clans now comb the dungeon for riches.

	"From the Crystal Labyrinth, a githyanki force wages war against the {@creature mind flayer|MM} colony of Seadeeps. Additionally, a group of githzerai inhabit Level 15, ready and willing to aid their distant cousins if the need arises.

	"{@creature bugbear|MM|Bugbears}, {@creature goblin|MM|goblins}, and {@creature hobgoblin|MM|hobgoblins} permeate the upper reaches of Undermountain, often serving in the Xanathar Guild, the Legion of Azrok, or the Goblin Bazaar. Goblinoid adventurers could be recruited from any of these factions with motivations of expanding its influence or escaping out from under the thumb of their rulers. For example, a member of the Legion of Azrok might discover that {@creature intellect devourer|MM|intellect devourers} have replaced the minds of many of the Legion's finest. Fearing for their own life, they might get out before it's too late. See Volo's Guide to Monsters for details on goblinoid player characters.": "{@creature bugbear|MM|Bugbears}, {@creature goblin|MM|goblins}, and {@creature hobgoblin|MM|hobgoblins}渗透到安德矿山的上层地区，通常效力于Xanathar公会、Azrok军团或者哥布林市场。哥布林冒险者可能从这些派系中的任何一个招募，动机可能是扩大影响力或摆脱统治者的控制。例如，Azrok军团的一名成员可能发现{@creature intellect devourer|MM|intellect devourers}已经取代了许多军团中最优秀的成员的思想。担心自己的生命安全，他们可能会在为时已晚之前离开。有关哥布林玩家角色的详细信息，请参阅《沃罗怪物指南》。",
	"The Port of Shadows has existed for so long that it's feasible for almost any character of any race to emerge as an adventurer. Characters are bound only (mostly) by their imagination.

	"Why venture to Undermountain? It's a good question, one to be asked by both you and your players. Unlike other adventures whose motives boil down to saving the world or escaping some dark prison, WDMM is one that is, seemingly, spurred only by the lust for gold and glory. It therefore falls upon you to keep your players invested in Undermountain. The universal motives of gold, glory, and power can only interest the adventurers for so long, especially as they get to the more lethal levels. It's recommended you instead turn to your own players as a source of creativity.": "为什么要冒险前往地下山（Undermountain）呢？这是一个很好的问题，应该由你和你的玩家共同提出。与其他冒险的动机是拯救世界或逃离某个黑暗监狱不同，WDMM 是一个看似只受到对黄金和荣耀的欲望驱使的冒险。因此，你需要让你的玩家对地下山保持投入。黄金、荣耀和权力这些普遍的动机只能吸引冒险者们一段时间，特别是当他们到达更危险的层次时。建议你转而将注意力放在你自己的玩家身上，作为创造力的源泉。",

Therefore, this level is an exercise of restraint and tact on the part of the party.": "这一章是叙事性质的，而非探索性质的。冒险者们应该与{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}进行密切互动，并逐渐意识到这位自然典范具有巨大、无情的愤怒。因此，这个层次是一种对冒险队来说需要克制和策略的练习。",
	"It's autumn when the party arrives. Day is darkening into dusk and a full moon is due.": "当派对抵达时，正值秋天。白天渐渐变暗，夜幕降临，一轮满月即将升起。",
	"While your adventurers are likely to take a long rest early, you want them to first meet {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} (see Act II below), as many events occur at night.": "尽管你的冒险者可能会早早地休息，但你希望他们首先遇到{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} (见下文第二幕)，因为许多事件发生在夜间。",
	"Tunnels connect to both Levels 6 & 7 (see A8 & 10). To prevent the party from taking these tunnels, you can require they secure {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} permission first—as entering her domain is easy but leaving is forbidden. She only grants permission if the adventurers wipe out the {@creature werebat|WDMM} colony.": "隧道连接到6级和7级（见A8和10）。为防止冒险者通过这些隧道，你可以要求他们首先获得{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的许可——因为进入她的领地很容易，但离开是被禁止的。只有当冒险者消灭{@creature werebat|WDMM}殖民地时，她才会授予许可。",
	"Three arcane gates are on this level: one to L2 (see A3B), L3 (see A6I) and L6 (see A9). The latter is too high of a level for the party to open.": "这一层有三个奥术之门：一个通往L2（见A3B），一个通往L3（见A6I），还有一个通往L6（见A9）。后者对于队伍来说是一个太高等级无法打开的门。",
	"{@creature Cloaker|MM|Cloakers} lair in A4. They can speak both {@language Deep Speech|PHB} and {@language Undercommon|PHB}, so prepare extra dialogue if the adventurers can speak either language.": "{@creature Cloaker|MM|Cloakers}巢穴在A4。它们可以说{@language Deep Speech|PHB}和{@language Undercommon|PHB}，所以如果冒险者会说其中任何一种语言，准备额外的对话。",
	"Halaster takes a backseat for this level, only appearing to share the secrets of {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} past. See Halaster's Visit in Special Events.": "Halaster在这一层退居幕后，只会出现来分享{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}过去的秘密。请查看特殊事件中的Halaster的访问。",

See Other Considerations below.": "为你的冒险者准备好签订或甚至请求{@creature werebat|WDMM} {@variantrule Player Characters as Lycanthropes|MM|lycanthropy}。请参阅其他注意事项。",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} makes for a fantastic antagonist for several reasons, but the most promising is this: no one ever suspects druids of being evil—and make no mistake, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} has great evil in her. Her alignment may officially be chaotic neutral, but there is nothing good, or even neutral, about murdering campers that dare start a fire to stay warm; promising genocide to a species that has no choice but to suck blood; and eradicating a cult—dedicated to a god of hunting—for the mistake of hunting too many boars. Alas, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} believes herself to be just and right—and that's what makes her truly evil.": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 之所以成为一个出色的反派，原因有很多，但最有潜力的是这一点：没有人会怀疑德鲁伊会是邪恶的——毫无疑问，{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 的内心充满了邪恶。她的立场可能正式是混乱中立，但在杀害那些敢于生火取暖的露营者时，承诺对一种只能吸血的物种进行种族灭绝，以及根除一个以狩猎之神为信仰的邪教——因为错误地猎杀了太多野猪，这些行为中没有任何善良，甚至中立的成分。可惜，{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 自认为自己是正义和正确的化身——这正是使她真正邪恶的原因。",
	"The {@creature archdruid|VGM} is a creature of unending compassion—for wildlife. People, however, stoke the coals of her paranoia and remind her of all she's lost. {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} nurses two fears that dominate her entire personality: growing attached to another person, and admitting that the awakened sycophants she's surrounded herself with aren't enough to satisfy her—she can frolic with beasts all she likes, but they can never be human.": "{@creature archdruid|VGM}是一个永无止境的怜悯之物——对于野生动物。然而，人们却煽动了她的偏执，让她想起了自己失去的一切。{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}养育着两种主导她整个人格的恐惧：与另一个人产生依恋，并承认她所包围的那些觉醒谄媚者并不能满足她——她可以与野兽嬉戏，但它们永远不会是人类。",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} is also adamant with her prejudices and opinions:": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 也对她的偏见和观点坚定不移：",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} considers the dragon a valued member of the forest and demands visitors show \"{@item Tearulai|WDMM}\" respect.": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}认为龙是森林中受尊敬的成员，并要求访客对\"{@item Tearulai|WDMM}\"表示尊重。",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} considers and describes the {@creature werebat|WDMM|werebats} as insatiable vermin infesting her realm. They have no \"natural place\" in her woods, nor the circle of life itself. She tolerated such pitiable creatures until recently when the gluttony of one {@creature werebat|WDMM} convinced her that they're nothing more than parasites. She wants them gone from her realm immediately and no means are too red.": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}认为并描述{@creature werebat|WDMM|werebats}为滋扰她领地的贪婪害虫。他们在她的树林中没有\"自然位置\"，也不在生命循环中。她曾容忍这些可怜的生物，直到最近一个{@creature werebat|WDMM}的贪婪让她相信他们只是寄生虫。她希望立即将它们从她的领地中清除，不惜任何手段。",
	"In {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} mind, she can do no wrong—and any wrong is, of course, justified. She had to kill Crissann; his mind was bent by Halaster. Slaughtering the Cult of Malar was nothing short of justice for the wildlife they slaughtered. And all the adventurers that have passed through this forest? They all had it coming. When confronted with her crimes, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} doesn't lie or cover up her deeds, but instead owns them with pride. Only the death of her late husband, Yinark, haunts her—and there is no way for her to justify her actions.": "在{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的心目中，她没有做错的事情——任何错误当然都是有道理的。她不得不杀死克里桑；他的思想被哈拉斯特扭曲了。屠杀玛拉尔教派绝对是为了他们屠杀的野生动物而行的正义之举。而所有穿过这片森林的冒险者？他们都是活该。当面对她的罪行时，{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}并不撒谎或掩盖她的行为，而是自豪地承认。只有她已故丈夫伊纳克的死亡让她感到内疚——而她无法为自己的行为辩解。",
	"Despite her vow to never again let a mortal touch her heart, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} still yearns for companionship. The trouble, she rationalized, was being with men of the blade or the Arcane. If a druid, ranger, nature cleric, or other person with a strong bond to Nature entered her domain, she might consider taking them as a consort.": "尽管誓言再也不让凡人触及她的心，{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 仍然渴望伴侣。她理智地解释说，问题在于与持刀或奥术之人为伴。如果一个德鲁伊、游侠、自然牧师或其他与自然有着强烈联系的人进入她的领地，她可能会考虑接纳他们为伴侣。",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} is the central character of this level; all roads lead back to her. Long before the adventurers realize her evil, they'll have wandered into her web. This intrigue can be cultivated through these points:": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 是这个层级的中心人物；所有的道路都通向她。冒险者们在意识到她的邪恶之前，很久以前就已经陷入了她的陷阱。通过以下几点可以培养这种情节：",
	"Play upon the druid's stereotype and adventurers' assumptions. All druids are just peace-loving hippies, right?": "玩弄德鲁伊的刻板印象和冒险者的假设。所有德鲁伊都只是爱好和平的嬉皮士，对吗？",
	"Paint an innocent faction as evil—the {@creature werebat|WDMM|werebats}.": "把一个无辜的派系描绘成邪恶的——{@creature werebat|WDMM|werebats}。",
	"Present {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} as a good or tragic hero that the adventurers will be inclined to side with. If they begin to accuse others of her crimes, you've done your job.": "将{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}塑造成一个好的或悲剧性的英雄，让冒险者倾向于支持她。如果他们开始指责其他人犯下她的罪行，那么你的工作就完成了。",
	"Inevitably, the adventurers will incur {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} wrath and the fly will realize it's been in the spider's web all this time.": "不可避免地，冒险者们将招致{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的愤怒，而这只苍蝇将意识到自己一直被蜘蛛网困住了。",
	"Consider the entirety of Wyllowwood as one story, which is divided into the following acts:": "将整个Wyllowwood视为一个故事，分为以下几个部分：",
	"The adventurers reach the splendor of Wyllowwood. The shock of its beauty will be thawed soon enough when they realize this isn't the idyllic wonderland it's painted as. They first find {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} sign in Area 2, then the discarded objects in Area 5. This is necessary foreshadowing of {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} evil—but to foil it, {@item Tearulai|WDMM}, the {@creature young green dragon|MM}, is seen soaring above the canopy to his platform (Area 9).": "冒险者们抵达了维洛伍德(Wyllowwood)的壮丽景色。当他们意识到这并不是被描绘成的田园仙境时，美丽的震撼很快就会消退。他们首先在区域2发现了{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的标志，然后在区域5发现了被丢弃的物品。这是{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}邪恶的必要铺垫——为了挫败它，{@creature young green dragon|MM}，作为{@item Tearulai|WDMM}，被看到在树冠上空中飞翔，飞往他的平台(区域9)。",
	"The adventurers find themselves face-to-face with {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} in any of the following ways:": "冒险者们以以下任何一种方式与{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}面对面：",
	"The party sights the tower (A6) and may press on towards it. Or, a sparrow under the effect of an {@spell animal messenger} spell invites them to visit. Sky's the limit, right?": "队伍发现了塔楼（A6），可以继续前往。或者，一只受到{@spell animal messenger}咒语影响的麻雀邀请他们前往。天空是极限，对吧？",
	"While traveling along the river or through the woods, they find {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} bathing. Ever confident, she emerges from the water to greet the party, inviting them to her tower for a \"more formal audience.\" She takes her leave by shapeshifting into a {@creature raven|MM} and making for Area 6.": "当沿着河流或穿过树林旅行时，他们发现{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}在沐浴。她自信满满地从水中走出来，邀请队伍去她的塔楼进行“更正式的会面”。她变形成{@creature raven|MM}后离开，前往第6区。",
	"The adventurers come across a glade in the woods. Napping at its center or in the boughs of a tree is {@creature Wyllow|WDMM}. If woken, she smiles and greets the adventurers, inviting them to her tower. She takes her leave by shapeshifting into a {@creature raven|MM}.": "冒险者们来到树林中的一个空地。在中心打盹，或者在树枝上的是{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}。如果被唤醒，她会微笑着向冒险者们打招呼，并邀请他们去她的塔楼。最后，她会变形成一个{@creature raven|MM}离开。",
	"Once the party meets {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} at her tower, she introduces herself and explains just how a forest has thrived so deep underground. So long as the adventurers don't harm the forest or its wildlife, she guarantees them safe harbor.": "一旦派对在她的塔楼遇见{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}，她会介绍自己并解释森林是如何在地下深处茁壮成长的。只要冒险者不伤害森林或其野生动物，她保证他们能得到安全庇护。",
	"While normally, visitors are free to enter and leave Wyllowwood, the {@i Companion} has twisted that. Entering is easy; leaving requires the {@creature druid|MM|druid's} permission, which she only grants if the adventurers wipe out the {@creature werebat|WDMM} colony (A12–16). {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} describes them as parasites and criminals that disobey her laws.": "尽管通常情况下，游客可以自由进出Wyllowwood，但{@i Companion}已经扭曲了这一点。进入很容易；离开则需要{@creature druid|MM|druid's}的许可，只有在冒险者消灭{@creature werebat|WDMM}殖民地(A12-16)后，她才会授予许可。{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}将他们描述为违背她法律的寄生虫和罪犯。",
	"All {@creature werebat|WDMM|werebats}, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} insists, must be put to the sword—and little do the adventurers know that that includes the children too. If the adventurers refuse to cut down the babes and return to her, they incur {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} wrath. See {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} Hunt below. See A6A below for dialogue and details.": "所有{@creature werebat|WDMM|werebats}，{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}坚持认为，必须被处以死刑——冒险者们并不知道这也包括儿童。如果冒险者们拒绝杀死婴儿并回到她那里，他们将招致{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的愤怒。请查看下方的{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}猎杀。有关对话和详细信息，请查看下方的A6A。",
	"After meeting with {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} and accepting her quest, the remaining omens must be broadcast to the adventurers. They serve to sow doubt in the players' minds and to push them into questioning {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} morality—or instead siding with their biases about druids. See, every time they're confronted by the evidence of {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} dark deeds, they should wonder: was it the druidess or the dragon or some other outside force? Surely sweet little {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} couldn't be capable of this.": "与{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}会面并接受她的任务后，剩下的预兆必须向冒险者们传达。它们旨在在玩家们的心中播下怀疑的种子，并推动他们质疑{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的道德——或者选择站在他们对德鲁伊的偏见一边。每当他们面对{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}邪恶行径的证据时，他们应该思考：是德鲁伊女祭司还是龙或其他外部力量？当然，可爱的小{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}不可能做出这种事情。",
	"The following omens should be presented to the party:": "以下征兆应该呈现给队伍：",
	"The skeletal remains of the Malar cult in A7. No weapon or burn marks mar the remains, suggesting these sixty humans all died to something toxic—and didn't the party already catch a glimpse of a green dragon?": "在A7中发现了玛拉教派的骷髅遗骸。没有发现任何武器或烧伤痕迹，这表明这六十名人类都死于某种有毒物质——而且难道派对不是已经瞥见了一只绿龙了吗？",
	"Malar's Haven, the abandoned complex (A18–20), which should have the adventurers wonder what catastrophe befell the inhabitants—after all, the possessions all lie untouched. It's as if they never knew what hit them.": "玛拉的避风港，这座被遗弃的建筑群(A18-20)，应该让冒险者们想知道居民们遭遇了什么样的灾难——毕竟，所有的财产都还未被动过。就好像他们从未意识到发生了什么。",
	"Having seen visitors enter Wyllowwood, Vool the Outcast approaches the adventurers. As a nocturnal creature, the most opportune moment would be at night while the party rests. However, the {@creature werebat|WDMM} is desperate enough to approach during the day. See A Desperate Vool in Special Events below.": "在看到游客进入(威洛伍德)后，被流放者(沃尔)接近了冒险者们。作为一个夜行性生物，最适合的时机应该是在晚上，当队伍休息时。然而，{@creature werebat|WDMM} 在白天也已经绝望到足够接近了。请参阅特殊事件中的《绝望的(沃尔)》。",
	"Sensing visitors to this realm, Valdemar, the {@creature young green dragon|MM}, uses the last of its will to send secret messages to the adventurers by reshaping twigs and leaves or by leaving whispers on the wind. All say, \"Free me. Please.\" Pepper them in as you see fit. Gentle winds blow towards Area 9.": "感知到来访者，瓦尔德马尔，{@creature young green dragon|MM}，利用最后一丝意志，通过重塑树枝和树叶或者在风中留下细语，向冒险者发送秘密信息。所有信息都说：“释放我。拜托。” 请根据需要适当插入。和风吹向区域9。",
	"Should they free Valdemar by pulling {@item Tearulai|WDMM} from its skull, the dragon promises its wrath if the party confronts {@creature Wyllow|WDMM}. This is a lie—unless the battle turns overwhelmingly in the party's favor. With {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} dead, the dragon will rule this land.": "如果他们通过从龙头上拔出{@item Tearulai|WDMM}来释放瓦尔德马尔，那条龙承诺如果队伍与{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}对抗，它会发泄怒火。这是个谎言——除非战斗明显倒向队伍一方。如果{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}死了，那条龙将统治这片土地。",
	"If {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} learns that the adventurers have freed Valdemar, she sets out to destroy them.": "如果{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}得知冒险者们已经释放了瓦尔德马，她会出发去摧毁他们。",
	"At last, the climax of this level. The adventurers incur {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} wrath—or confront her over her many crimes—and must face a guerrilla fighter served by the forest itself. See {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} Hunt for the play-by-play of how this battle turns out.": "终于，这一关的高潮来临了。冒险者们招致{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的愤怒—或者因她的众多罪行而与她对抗—他们必须面对由森林本身服务的游击战士。查看{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}《猎杀》以了解这场战斗的详细过程。",
	"When the adventurers incur {@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's} wrath, her \"justice\" is swift and brutal. A sadist deluded by her own lies, this predator hunts down the party in a myriad of ways. Facing her is a lesson in guerrilla warfare, for this one-woman army is a nightmare to behold. Never will they face her in a stuffy room or enclosed environment and never will she offer them a fair fight.": "当冒险者招致{@creature Wyllow|WDMM|Wyllow's}的愤怒时，她的“正义”是迅速而残酷的。这位被自己谎言蒙蔽的虐待狂者，以多种方式猎杀着队伍。面对她是游击战的一课，因为这位独行的军队是一场可怕的噩梦。他们永远不会在拥挤的房间或封闭的环境中面对她，她也永远不会给他们一个公平的战斗。",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} stages a series of ambushes, mainly determined by location or your own whimsy. The adventurers will lack for an easy battle, for the druidess strikes surgically from afar, armed with potent magic, loyal servants, and a terrain she knows better than anyone. This confrontation is not so much a battle but a desperate escape from her wrath, punctuated by motes of fire and fanged beasts.": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 策划了一系列伏击，主要取决于地点或你自己的心血来潮。冒险者们将不会轻易获得胜利，因为这位德鲁伊女祭司远距离精准打击，拥有强大的魔法、忠诚的仆从，以及她比任何人都熟悉的地形。这场对抗不仅仅是一场战斗，更像是从她的愤怒中绝望逃脱，伴随着火焰和獠牙兽的出现。",
	"When {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} begins her hunt, she visits her tower (Area 6) and sets the Calendar Stone to night, so that she can ambush her prey under the cover of darkness. She also forces winter upon Wyllowwood, making it an environment of {@hazard extreme cold} (see the sidebar above for its effects).": "当{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}开始狩猎时，她会前往她的塔楼（区域6）并将日历石设定为夜晚，这样她就可以在黑暗中伏击猎物。她还让冬天笼罩在Wyllowwood上，使其成为一个{@hazard extreme cold}的环境（请参见上面的边栏了解其效果）。",

	"Sour over their past behavior, {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} will not tolerate any more lycanthropes in her domain. She demands the cursed character submit to a cleansing ritual (in the form of a {@spell remove curse} spell) or be banished from her demesne.": "对于他们过去的行为感到愤怒，{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} 不会容忍在她领地内再有任何狼人。她要求那个被诅咒的角色接受一场净化仪式（以{@spell remove curse}咒语的形式）或被驱逐出她的领地。",
	"Hey, if one character is virtually immune to most attacks, that just means you can amp up combat from here on out, right? Halaster telepathically tells them, \"Now that you're cursed, I have no excuse to hold back. Enjoy!\" You, as the DM, now have carte blanche to add all sorts of baddies to future encounters.": "嘿，如果一个角色几乎免疫大多数攻击，那只意味着你可以从现在开始加强战斗，对吧？哈拉斯特（Halaster）通过心灵感应告诉他们：“现在你们被诅咒了，我没有理由再退缩。尽情享受吧！”作为DM，你现在可以放手在未来的战斗中加入各种坏家伙。",
	"Halaster can cause a ray of sunlight to always shine above the lycanthrope, disadvantaging it per the Sunlight Sensitivity trait.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）可以让一道阳光始终照耀在狼人（lycanthrope）头顶上，使其在太阳光敏感（Sunlight Sensitivity）特质下处于劣势。",
	"Your campaign might be drastically altered if the adventurers take {@item Tearulai|WDMM} (see A9). Not only is it an incredibly powerful weapon, it also has the will and drive to return to the place of its creation—with its wielder forced to come along for the ride.": "如果冒险者拿走{@item Tearulai|WDMM}（见A9），你的冒险可能会发生巨大变化。这不仅是一把极其强大的武器，它还有意志和动力回到它创造的地方——而持有者被迫跟着一起前往。",
	"If the adventurers claim this sword, you must be prepared for the campaign to take a sudden detour as {@item Tearulai|WDMM} attempts to return to Myth Drannor by means of its wielder—or just scrap that entirely. It would be far less disruptive to your game to give {@item Tearulai|WDMM} patience, but then there's no danger or drawback to using the sword.": "如果冒险者们拿到这把剑，你必须准备好战役突然改变方向，因为{@item Tearulai|WDMM}试图通过持剑者返回迷思德兰诺，或者干脆放弃这个设定。给{@item Tearulai|WDMM}耐心可能会减少游戏的干扰，但这样就没有使用这把剑的危险或不利之处了。",
	"Assuming you keep this danger in play, if its wielder's goals run counter to its own, {@item Tearulai|WDMM} attempts to take control of its wielder (subjecting it to a {@dc 17} Charisma saving throw). On a failure, the wielder is {@condition charmed} for {@dice 1d12} hours, during which {@item Tearulai|WDMM} attempts to reach the surface. The blade is cunning enough to wait until the adventurers encounter a quick means to the surface, such as one of Halaster's arcane gates. The most opportune gate is on Level 10, which links to Level 1. {@item Tearulai|WDMM} would take that very moment to strike.": "假设您保持这种危险存在，如果使用者的目标与其相悖，{@item Tearulai|WDMM} 会试图控制使用者（使其进行一次 {@dc 17} 魅力豁免检定）。如果失败，使用者会被 {@condition charmed}，持续 {@dice 1d12} 小时，在此期间 {@item Tearulai|WDMM} 会试图抵达地表。这把刀足够狡猾，会等到冒险者们遇到快速通往地表的方法，比如哈拉斯特的奥术之门之类的。最合适的门在第10层，连接到第1层。{@item Tearulai|WDMM} 会选择那个时刻发动攻击。",
	"{@item Tearulai|WDMM} admires great beauty, music, fine art, and poetry. Vain, the weapon strives to improve its appearance. It craves gemstones and seeks out better ones with which to adorn itself. Most of all, it longs to return to the forests around Myth Drannor, where it was created.": "{@item Tearulai|WDMM} 钦佩着伟大的美丽、音乐、精美的艺术和诗歌。这把武器是虚荣的，它努力改善自己的外表。它渴望宝石，并寻找更好的宝石来装饰自己。最重要的是，它渴望回到在米斯·德兰诺附近的森林，那里是它被创造的地方。",
	"If {@item Tearulai|WDMM} is acquired, you can use it as a new character for the adventurers. Use the sword as a mouthpiece for Undermountain, granting it vast knowledge of the dungeon—never enough to ruin a surprise, but able to reveal background information that you're struggling to convey to your players. The blade may even consider answering these questions as a quid pro quo, stacking up a debt—which can take the form as a cumulative −1 penalty to a character's Charisma saving throw to avoid being {@condition charmed} by {@item Tearulai|WDMM}.": "如果获得{@item Tearulai|WDMM}，你可以将其用作冒险者的新角色。使用剑作为地下山的代言人，赋予它对地牢的广泛知识——永远不会透露足以破坏惊喜的信息，但可以揭示你难以传达给玩家的背景信息。这把剑甚至可能会以问答的方式回答这些问题，积累一笔债务——这可以形成一个累积的-1惩罚，用于角色的魅力豁免投掷，以避免被{@item Tearulai|WDMM}所{@condition charmed}。",
	"The River of the Depths twists below the mountain, sometimes lit by iridescent fungi but more often cloaked in darkness. The farther on you go, the quicker it grows until the waters swell into rapids and its roar into thunder.": "深渊河在山脚下蜿蜒流淌，有时被虹彩般的真菌照亮，但更多时候被黑暗所笼罩。随着你继续前行，河流变得越来越急，直到水流膨胀成急流，轰鸣如雷。",
	"If the party arrives to Wyllowwood by means of a boat, you can kick off this level with a skill challenge. The river hits nasty rough water before spilling out into this idyllic wonderland. The party must navigate the rapids.": "如果队伍乘船抵达(維洛伍德)Wyllowwood，你可以通过技能挑战来开始这一关。河流在涌入这片田园仙境之前会经历恶劣的急流。队伍必须航行过急流。",
	"Skill challenges are a relic of 4th Edition that recently made an unofficial comeback in 5E. Rather than fight, players must navigate a danger through their skills (making ability checks). Think of it as a montage.": "技能挑战是第四版的遗留物，最近在第五版中非官方地卷土重来。与其战斗，玩家必须通过他们的技能（进行能力检定）来应对危险。可以将其想象成一段蒙太奇。",
	"The party must succeed on four ability checks before failing three. Once a character has used a specific skill, they personally can't use it again for the remainder of the challenge. This is to spur creativity and prevent the rogue from repeatedly use his {@skillCheck acrobatics 9} {@skill Acrobatics} skill. Players suggest skills to overcome obstacles, such as {@skill Perception} to sight the stalactites ahead before hitting them. At your discretion, a player can only use a skill they're proficient with, so as to lend importance to it.": "队伍必须在失败三次之前成功通过四次能力检定。一旦角色使用了特定技能，他们个人在挑战的剩余部分就不能再使用它。这是为了激发创造力，防止盗贼反复使用他的{@skillCheck acrobatics 9} {@skill Acrobatics}技能。玩家可以建议使用技能来克服障碍，比如{@skill Perception}来提前发现前方的钟乳石。酌情而定，玩家只能使用他们精通的技能，以突显其重要性。",
	"The challenge is divided into obstacles, described below. Roll initiative simply to have an order for the players to go in. They don't need to adhere to the order, but it does help critical thinking. On their turn, each player suggests a skill or tool to overcome an obstacle. Not coming up with a solution carries no penalty, unless no one can, in which case the party accumulates one failure—the price of indecision.": "挑战被分为障碍，如下所述。简单地进行先攻骰来确定玩家的顺序。他们不需要遵循这个顺序，但这有助于批判性思维。在他们的回合中，每位玩家提出一个技能或工具来克服一个障碍。如果没有想出解决方案，不会受到任何惩罚，除非没有人能够，那么团队将累积一次失败——这是犹豫的代价。",
	"Failing an ability check merely means the vessel takes damage. On the third failure, the vessel is destroyed, and the characters are overcome by the rapids. Eventually, they spill out into Wyllowwood after suffering {@damage 4d8} bludgeoning damage.": "在本地语言习惯的基础上，未通过能力检定仅意味着船只受到伤害。第三次失败时，船只被摧毁，角色被急流冲倒。最终，他们在承受{@damage 4d8}钝击伤害后漂流到了威洛伍德（Wyllowwood）。",
	"The following obstacles have been written for you; replace them as you see fit. The DCs of all ability checks are also left up to you, though they ought to be high considering the party is 8th level and this river is a treacherous one.": "以下障碍已经为您准备好了；根据需要进行替换。所有技能检定的难度等级也由您决定，考虑到队伍是8级，而这条河流非常危险。\n\n1. A narrow bridge made of rotting wood spans the river. The planks are loose and slippery, requiring a DC 18 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to cross safely.\n2. A strong current rushes through a narrow gorge, making it difficult to swim across. A DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check is needed to reach the other side without being swept away.\n3. A series of stepping stones are partially submerged in the fast-flowing water. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check is needed to spot the safest path across.\n4. A sudden gust of wind threatens to knock anyone on the bridge off-balance. A DC 16 Strength saving throw is required to remain steady.\n5. A slippery rock face must be climbed to bypass a waterfall. A DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check is needed to ascend safely.\n6. A hidden whirlpool lurks beneath the surface, ready to pull swimmers under. A DC 17 Constitution saving throw is required to break free if caught in its grasp.",
	"The party encounters rough waters that soon swell into rapids. Suggestions include vehicle (water) checks or {@skill Survival} to navigate the channel without crashing into rocks.": "队伍遇到了波涛汹涌的水域，很快就变成了急流。建议进行水上载具检查或者使用{@skill Survival}来避开撞到岩石的危险。",
	"A band of {@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks} are spearing fish along the river. Suggestions include {@skill Stealth} to remain undetected (as {@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks} are blind); {@skill Performance} to sound like a predator; {@skill Perception} to detect them long before they can; or {@skill Sleight of Hand} to toss an object so as to distract them. On a failure, the {@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks} hurl four {@item spear|PHB|spears} ({@hit 5} to hit, {@damage 1d6 + 3} piercing damage) at the characters or their boat.": "一群{@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks}正在河边用矛捕鱼。建议包括{@skill Stealth}保持隐蔽（因为{@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks}是盲的）；{@skill Performance}模仿捕食者的声音；{@skill Perception}能提前发现它们；或者{@skill Sleight of Hand}扔一个物体来分散它们的注意力。如果失败，这些{@creature grimlock|MM|grimlocks}会向角色或他们的船投掷四个{@item spear|PHB|spears}（命中{@hit 5}，造成{@damage 1d6 + 3}穿刺伤害）。",
	"The hull is breached by stones below the surface and water fills the vessel. With a successful {@skill Sleight of Hand} check, one could be quick enough to bail water, while {@item carpenter's tools|PHB} could patch up the hole, provided there's adequate material such as pitch or tar.": "船体被水下的石头击穿，水开始灌进船舱。通过成功的{@skill Sleight of Hand}检定，有人可以迅速舀水，而{@item carpenter's tools|PHB}可以修补漏洞，前提是有足够的材料，如沥青或焦油。",
	"Stalactites hang from the ceiling and are avoided—but where there are stalactites so too are there stalagmites, likely under the waterline. Characters proficient in {@skill Nature} or {@skill Survival} are likely to know that, and you can call a check for it, rather than the players suggesting it.": "钟乳石悬挂在天花板上，需要避开——但是在那里有钟乳石的地方，很可能也有钟乳石柱，可能在水下。擅长{@skill Nature}或{@skill Survival}的角色可能会知道这一点，你可以进行检定，而不是玩家提出建议。",
	"The river takes a sudden turn and the vessel crashes into rocks—not enough to arrest their movement but to overturn the boat. Suggestions include {@skill Athletics} to overpower the momentum or snatch a falling comrade; or {@skill Insight} to predict this fate as the vessel rushes towards the rocks.": "河流突然转弯，船只撞上了岩石——不足以阻止它们的运动，但足以使船翻倒。建议包括用 {@skill Athletics} 来克服动力或抓住掉落的同伴；或者用 {@skill Insight} 来预测船只冲向岩石的命运。",
	"Halaster manifests an illusion of a {@creature hydra|MM}, whose many heads rise up from the waters. The beast opens its maws and acid boils up from its legion throats—but true hydras don't spit acid, and a discerning character can make an {@skill Arcana} or {@skill Nature} check to know that; or an {@skill Investigation} check to see through the Illusion ({@dc 16}). All these checks can be called for by you, rather than be suggested by the players. If characters bail from the boat or attack the {@creature hydra|MM}, they accumulate a failure—for it was all a ruse to distract them from a waterfall that Halaster has cloaked and silenced under an illusion—a waterfall that was otherwise easily navigable given time and effort.": "哈拉斯特(Halaster)显现出一个{@creature hydra|MM}的幻象，它的许多头从水中升起。这个怪兽张开它的口，酸液从它众多的喉咙中涌出——但真正的九头蛇并不会喷酸，一个敏锐的角色可以进行{@skill Arcana}或{@skill Nature}的检定来了解这一点；或者进行{@skill Investigation}的检定来看穿这个幻象((Illusion)). 所有这些检定都可以由你来调用，而不是由玩家建议。如果角色们从船上逃跑或攻击这个{@creature hydra|MM}，他们会积累一个失败——因为这只是一个幌子，是为了转移他们的注意力，让他们不注意哈拉斯特用幻象掩盖和消音的瀑布——这个瀑布在时间和努力下本来是很容易穿越的。",
	"The river spills out into a vast cavern—no, not a cavern but a valley green with life: trees dyed in the autumnal shades of yellow and orange, and brush as thick as a vagrant's hair. You hear birds singing on the wind—yes, that's right, actual wind.": "河流流入一个巨大的洞穴——不，不是一个洞穴，而是一个充满生机的绿色山谷：树木染上了秋天的黄色和橙色，灌木丛像流浪者的头发一样浓密。你听到风中传来鸟儿的歌声——没错，确实是风。",

While Maddgoth is {@condition grappled}, a creature can attempt to take off the helm—an otherwise mundane task exacerbated by Maddgoth's rage, iron will and ego—via a {@dc 16} Strength saving throw. If he is {@condition incapacitated}, it can be taken off, no saving throw required.": "麦戈斯(Maddgoth)的首要任务是从25B区域取回他的头盔，这个头盔让他免疫所有伤害。当麦戈斯处于{@condition grappled}状态时，生物可以尝试摘下头盔——这本来是一项平凡的任务，但由于麦戈斯的愤怒、铁意志和自我，变得更加困难，需要进行{@dc 16}力量豁免检定。如果他处于{@condition incapacitated}状态，头盔可以被摘下，无需进行豁免检定。",
	"Maddgoth never goes anywhere without backup, namely his {@creature homunculus|MM}. If in need of further minions, he releases the {@creature gray slaad|MM} from A33 or the {@creature nycaloth|MM|nycaloths} from A44. These minions remain {@condition invisible} and at a distance until Maddgoth orders them to attack.": "Maddgoth（麦戈斯）从不在没有后备的情况下行动，即他的{@creature homunculus|MM}。如果需要更多的爪牙，他会释放A33的{@creature gray slaad|MM}或A44的{@creature nycaloth|MM|nycaloths}。这些爪牙会保持{@condition invisible}并保持距离，直到麦戈斯下令让他们发动攻击。",
	"Long before entering combat, Maddgoth casts {@spell mage armor} and {@spell mind blank} upon himself.": "在进入战斗之前，Maddgoth对自己施放{@spell mage armor}和{@spell mind blank}。",
	"If combat erupts, Maddgoth casts {@spell time stop} on his first turn. He casts the following spells, if given enough rounds, in the following order of priority: {@spell mirror image}, {@spell fire shield}, {@spell mage armor}, {@spell stoneskin} and, finally, a {@spell cone of cold} spell.": "如果战斗爆发，麦戈斯在他的第一个回合施放{@spell time stop}。如果有足够的回合，他按以下优先顺序施放以下法术：{@spell mirror image}，{@spell fire shield}，{@spell mage armor}，{@spell stoneskin}，最后是一个{@spell cone of cold}法术。",
	"Maddgoth is fond of {@spell detect thoughts} spells to glean insight into his foes' plans.": "Maddgoth喜欢使用{@spell detect thoughts}法术来洞悉他敌人的计划。",
	"When faced with a powerful, single target, Maddgoth casts {@spell banishment}. Thanks to his {@item horned ring|WDMM}, he can bypass Undermountain's restrictions on magic, defenestrating a foe's dumb ass from this plane of existence.": "当面对一个强大的单一目标时，Maddgoth 施放 {@spell banishment}。由于他的 {@item horned ring|WDMM}，他可以绕过安德玛丹的魔法限制，将敌人的蠢货从这个存在平面中抛出。",
	"Provided he still has his {@item horned ring|WDMM}, Maddgoth teleports to safety when he's at 40 hit points or fewer.

	"With infinite {@spell disguise self} and {@spell invisibility} spells at his disposal, Maddgoth makes for a slippery foe.": "拥有无限{@spell disguise self}和{@spell invisibility}法术的马德戈斯(Maddgoth)是一个难以捉摸的敌人。",
	"Khodnar, a LN {@creature mage}, is surprisingly friendly. He's in a good mood, since Maddgoth has promised to research the secrets of lichdom with him. He never suspects Maddgoth's true intention until it's too late. Once the mage realizes that his host intends to murder the guests, Khodnar sides with the party and does his best to escape with them. He isn't prepared to give up his life for strangers, however, and can be deluded by Maddgoth into believing he'll be safe—that it was only these \"trespassers\" that are to be \"punished.\"": "Khodnar，一位LN{@creature mage}，出奇地友好。他心情很好，因为Maddgoth承诺要与他一起研究巫妖的秘密。直到为时已晚，他才意识到Maddgoth的真正意图。一旦这位法师意识到他的主人打算谋害客人，Khodnar就站在了队伍一边，并尽力与他们一起逃脱。然而，他并不准备为陌生人牺牲自己的生命，并且可能被Maddgoth欺骗，相信自己会安全无恙——只是这些“闯入者”才会被“惩罚”。",
	"Maddgoth's Dance unfolds across three acts:": "Maddgoth的舞蹈分为三幕：",
	"Maddgoth returns to his castle to find intruders therein. Ideally, this occurs after the adventurers have discovered the spellbooks in A25, and A31 and A46. A meeting with the {@creature homunculus|MM} and a romp with {@creature Otto|WDMM} is also preferable.": "麦戈斯回到他的城堡发现有入侵者。理想情况是在冒险者发现A25，A31和A46中的咒语书后发生。与{@creature homunculus|MM}的会面和与{@creature Otto|WDMM}的冒险也是可取的。",
	"When Maddgoth arrives, with Khodnar in tow, read:": "当Maddgoth（Maddgoth）和Khodnar（Khodnar）一起到达时，请阅读：",
	"The castle shudders with an unseen force. Soft thunder echoes out from the heart of the courtyard and a pale brilliance lights up the halls for just a moment. Someone's come to the castle. Its master, perhaps?": "城堡因一股看不见的力量而颤抖。轻柔的雷声从庭院的中心回荡，苍白的光辉在大厅中短暂地闪耀。有人来到了城堡。是城堡的主人吗？",
	"Maddgoth's return instantly turns on all the interior lights in the castle (if they aren't on already) as if the middle lever of the Console (see A37) was pulled. The {@creature homunculus|MM} cracks a grin and literally jumps with joy; {@creature Otto|WDMM} cowers in fear like a child whose mother is about to discover the mess he made.": "麦戈斯的回归立即打开了城堡内所有的灯光（如果它们还没有打开），就好像控制台（见A37）的中间杠杆被拉动一样。{@creature homunculus|MM}露出了一个笑容，欣喜若狂地跳了起来；{@creature Otto|WDMM}像一个母亲即将发现他弄脏了东西的孩子一样惊恐地退缩。",
	"The magi arrive in the courtyard (A23), loudly discussing their evening plans. If Maddgoth sees signs of intrusion, he at first casts {@spell mage armor} and {@spell mind blank} on himself, but otherwise doesn't let his surprise show. His ego already at critical mass, he acts with an air of confidence.": "三位魔法师抵达庭院（A23），大声讨论着他们的晚上计划。如果麦戈斯（Maddgoth）发现入侵的迹象，他会首先对自己施放{@spell mage armor}和{@spell mind blank}，但不让自己的惊讶表现出来。他的自负已经达到临界点，他表现出一种自信的姿态。",
	"Even if the adventurers hide from Maddgoth, the {@creature homunculus|MM} betrays their presence with telepathy. When he encounters his uninvited guests, he greets them with a smile. If {@creature Otto|WDMM} is still alive, it immediately flees from Maddgoth—but the wizard skewers it with a {@spell magic missile} spell straight through its eyeball. \"That pest has been squatting here for months. Try as I might, it never did listen to me,\" he says.": "即使冒险者们躲避{@creature homunculus|MM}，{@creature homunculus|MM} 通过心灵感应泄露了他们的位置。当他遇到这些不速之客时，他微笑着向他们打招呼。如果{@creature Otto|WDMM} 仍然活着，它立刻逃离了{@creature homunculus|MM}——但巫师用{@spell magic missile} 法术直接刺穿了它的眼球。\"那个讨厌的家伙已经在这里蹲了几个月了。无论我怎么努力，它从来没有听我的话，\"他说。",
	"Having met the adventurers, Maddgoth insists they stay for dinner—and he refuses to take no for an answer. Dinner quickly becomes staying the night as the killer's ego gets the better of him. This, Maddgoth is convinced, is his magnum opus. By midnight, he'll have slain all his victims. As insurance, he poisons tonight's wine with {@item Midnight Tears|DMG} poison (see above). He has five doses of antidote and is unconcerned if he also ingests the poison.": "在与冒险者见面后，麦戈斯坚持让他们留下来吃晚餐——他拒绝接受拒绝。晚餐很快变成留宿一晚，因为杀手的自负占了上风。麦戈斯坚信这是他的杰作。到午夜，他将会杀死所有的受害者。为了保险起见，他在今晚的葡萄酒中投放了{@item Midnight Tears|DMG}毒药（见上文）。他有五剂解药，如果他也误服毒药，他并不担心。",
	"Maddgoth gives the party an hour to freshen up—but this is just to cover his antics. First, he frees the {@creature gray slaad|MM} from A33 and retrieves the poison from A45. Thereafter, he can be found in the kitchen, A27B, guiding his {@creature Living Unseen Servant|WDMM|living unseen servants} as they prepare tonight's meal. If uninterrupted, he poisons the wine through an intricate conjuration spell (see A27 for details) which costs him a 2nd-level spell slot. It's advised you have at least one adventurer run into him in the kitchen to foreshadow this.": "麦戈斯给了队伍一个小时的时间让他们休整——但这只是为了掩盖他的花招。首先，他从A33中解救出{@creature gray slaad|MM}，并从A45处取回毒药。之后，他会在厨房A27B里，指导他的{@creature Living Unseen Servant|WDMM|living unseen servants}们准备今晚的晚餐。如果没有打扰，他会通过一个复杂的魔法咒语（详见A27）来给酒中下毒，这需要他消耗一个2级法术位。建议至少让一名冒险者在厨房里碰到他，为此提前铺垫。",
	"Maddgoth sends his {@creature homunculus|MM} to gather his guests and bring them to A27A. If he couldn't poison their wine earlier, Maddgoth may cast {@spell time stop} to do so now with the same spell he would've used earlier. During dinner, he plays with his food, and asks the adventurers probing questions or suggests feats of daring and high-stakes wagers.": "麦戈斯派遣他的{@creature homunculus|MM}去邀请客人并将他们带到A27A。如果他之前无法毒害他们的酒，麦戈斯可能会施放{@spell time stop}来使用同样的法术。在晚宴期间，他玩弄食物，向冒险者提出探询性问题或建议大胆的壮举和高赌注。",
	"Assuming his guests consume the poison, Maddgoth suggests watching an \"operatic illusion.\" It's the highlights reel of his scarlet career. See Area 46.": "假设他的客人们都服下毒药，麦戈斯建议观看一场“歌剧幻象”。这是他猩红生涯的精华片段。请查看46区域。",
	"Maddgoth insists the guests stay the night and has his {@creature Living Unseen Servant|WDMM|living unseen servants} prepare the guest rooms (A29–32). If the party refuses to stay, he pretends to not be bothered. He soon excuses himself to A37 and locks down the castle (see A37, \"Button 4\" for details).": "Maddgoth坚持让客人过夜，并让他的仆人们准备客房（A29–32）。如果冒险小组拒绝留下，他会假装不在意。他很快找借口离开到A37，并锁定了城堡（详情请参见A37，“Button 4”）。",
	"If the adventurers agree to stay, Maddgoth bides his time until 10 minutes before midnight when he launches his attack. The serial killer would much rather murder any spellcasters in a duel and leave the mundane guests to die to poison. He'll even go as far as waking any sleeping spellcasters. He stations his minions (the {@creature gray slaad|MM} and two {@creature nycaloth|MM|nycaloths}) outside other rooms while his {@creature homunculus|MM} roams the hall, lending its strength wherever necessary. See A29–32 for details.": "如果冒险者同意留下，麦戈斯会等待时机，直到午夜前10分钟发动攻击。这位连环杀手更愿意在决斗中杀死任何法术施展者，让普通客人死于毒药。他甚至会唤醒任何正在睡觉的法术施展者。他会让手下的手下（{@creature gray slaad|MM} 和两个 {@creature nycaloth|MM|nycaloths}）驻守其他房间外，而他的 {@creature homunculus|MM} 则在大厅里游荡，必要时提供力量。详情请参阅A29–32。",
	"If this ploy goes poorly, Maddgoth has but one contingency plan: a {@creature living unseen servant|WDMM} in A37 that presses the button to teleport all inhabitants to the castle's rooftop, A47. It's here that Maddgoth makes his last stand before dying or fleeing.": "如果这个计谋失败了，Maddgoth 只有一个应急计划：在 A37 中有一个 {@creature living unseen servant|WDMM}，按下按钮将所有居民传送到城堡屋顶，A47。就在这里，Maddgoth 在临死或逃跑前做最后的抵抗。",
	"This level's factions suffer from a disconnect. What occurs in Maddgoth's Castle has nothing to do with the {@creature stone giant|MM|stone giants} and vice versa. Assuming the adventurers don't murder the giants on sight, their only contribution to the campaign is to once again demonstrate how screwed up Halaster is. Without any tie-in to the castle, their only value to the players are as passerby—and that assumes that the adventurers actually speak {@language Giant|PHB}.": "这个级别的派系存在脱节。马德戈斯城堡发生的事情与{@creature stone giant|MM|stone giants}毫无关系，反之亦然。假设冒险者们不是一见到巨人就杀掉他们，他们对冒险的唯一贡献就是再次展示哈拉斯特有多么疯狂。如果没有与城堡的联系，他们对玩家的唯一价值就是过客——这还假设冒险者们真的会说{@language Giant|PHB}。",
	"It truly is astounding that none of this level's inhabitants speak {@language Common|PHB}. If you want to hand-wave this language barrier, then Halaster has enchanted these caverns with a {@spell comprehend languages} spell, allowing all creatures to understand each other. This magic does not extend to Maddgoth's castle, however.": "真是令人惊讶，这个层级的居民竟然没有人会说{@language Common|PHB}。如果你想要忽略这种语言障碍，那么哈拉斯特（Halaster）已经用{@spell comprehend languages}咒语给这些洞穴施加了魔法，使所有生物能够彼此理解。然而，这种魔法并不延伸到麦戈斯（Maddgoth）的城堡。",

	"Ghnorsh's rotting corpse can be found in a caved-in cavern between Areas 9 and 13. Beside him are the crushed corpses of two adventurers. The cave-in has made it impossible for the giants to enter and they've forgotten why they had to clear such rubble.

Fearing that his first victim will be a screamer or alert their fellows by magic, Maddgoth stations his minions outside the other rooms (the {@creature gray slaad|MM} and the two {@creature nycaloth|MM|nycaloths}). His {@creature homunculus|MM} roams around the hall, ready to lend its strength where necessary. It can communicate with Maddgoth via its Telepathic Bond feature. Once all forces are ready, he attacks. Maddgoth has the antidote on his person.": "如果冒险者留宿一晚，他们会发现自己被分配到四间客房中（当时区域31的尸体已被移走并房间已清理干净）。 Maddgoth 担心他的第一个受害者会尖叫或通过魔法警告同伴，因此他让手下守在其他房间外（{@creature gray slaad|MM} 和两个{@creature nycaloth|MM|nycaloths}）。他的{@creature homunculus|MM}在大厅里四处巡逻，随时准备提供必要的支援。它可以通过心灵感应的特性与Maddgoth进行沟通。一旦所有力量准备就绪，他就会发动攻击。Maddgoth身上携带着解药。",

	"You have a few options on how to run this encounter. It would be more beneficial to Maddgoth's Dance if \"Zartem\" didn't attack the adventurers, thus preserving his life until the slaad is needed as extra muscle for the {@creature archmage|MM}.

The slaad hits-and-runs until Maddgoth arrives.": "你有几种选项来进行这次遭遇。如果“扎尔坦(Zartem)”不攻击冒险者，保留他的生命直到需要作为{@creature archmage|MM}的额外力量时，对“玛德高斯之舞(Maddgoth's Dance)”会更有利。另一种选择是它攻击冒险者，受伤后逃跑，依靠其再生特性来治愈伤口。邪龙蛙(slaad)进行打击-撤退，直到玛德高斯到来。",
	"If \"Zartem\" holds back, it instead tries to score sympathy with the adventurers. It's forbidden to leave the castle by Maddgoth (who has its control gem).

The adventurers will learn again why they ought not trust anyone.": "如果\"Zartem\"不离开城堡，Maddgoth及时回来邀请冒险者留下来吃晚餐。Zartem随后成为另一位客人，随时准备帮助Maddgoth。当斯莱德发动第一次攻击时，它脱去伪装，展现出真实的外表和本质。冒险者将再次了解到他们为什么不应该相信任何人。",
	"Adjust Maddgoth's Dance accordingly to account for this additional guest. However, as the creature lacks immunity or even resistance to poison damage, it's loathe to drink the {@condition poisoned} wine (see Area 27).

	"As described in A37, turning the castle's interior lights on allows the giants to see it. Qurrok hurls boulders, some of which land on the rooftop. The boulders are still shrunk by magic, but their momentum is preserved, and the attack deals its normal damage (using the {@creature stone giant|MM|stone giant's} Rock attack). Pick a random area for the boulder to land, subjecting one creature in that space to its effects.

Now both House Freth and Auvryndar must contend with the beast; too many have strayed into its cavern only to never return. The beast has grown bolder in recent days and is now exploring deeper parts of the warrens and preying upon the {@creature drow|MM}.": "他们错了。{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 对除了自己以外的任何事物都没有忠诚，并将这段文字变成了自己的（见第7区）。现在弗雷斯伯爵家和奥维恩达家都必须与这个野兽抗衡；太多人误入它的洞穴后再也没有回来。这只野兽最近变得更加大胆，现在正在探索更深的地下通道，并捕食{@creature drow|MM}。",
	"The {@creature balhannoth|MTF} possesses a dim, but alien, mind. It has an Intelligence score of 6 but also telepathy out to a mile. So, when the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} makes telepathic contact, it doesn't exactly say anything, but instead... audibly slavers and pants. This is an uncomfortable experience. Its attention is hot, like the sun, but uninviting. They can feel its desperate want, like a stray dog hungering for the scraps in your hand. It has no eyes, but its gaze is no less piercing. The beast is perpetually moist and telepathic interactions with it leave someone feeling greasy and unclean. They should come away feeling as if they're the meat on display in a deli.": "{@creature balhannoth|MTF}拥有一颗昏暗而异样的心灵。它的智力值为6，但也具有一英里范围的心灵感应能力。因此，当{@creature balhannoth|MTF}进行心灵接触时，它并不会说任何话，而是发出口水和喘息的声音。这是一种令人不适的体验。它的注意力炽热如太阳，但并不友好。他们能感受到它迫切的渴望，就像一只流浪狗渴望你手中的残羹剩饭。它没有眼睛，但它的凝视同样锐利。这只野兽总是湿漉漉的，与它进行心灵互动会让人感觉油腻和不洁净。他们应该感觉自己就像是在熟食店里展示的肉。",
	"Use these glowing descriptions for whenever the beast telepathically contacts an adventurer. You don't need words to creep your players out. Frequent contact with the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} is sure to drive a man mad—which is what happened to Orl in A8.": "每当野兽以心灵感应方式联系冒险者时，请使用这些发光的描述。你无需言语就能让玩家感到毛骨悚然。频繁接触{@creature balhannoth|MTF}肯定会让一个人发疯—就像A8中的奥尔那样。",
	"The {@creature balhannoth|MTF} is an otherworldly, apex predator. Area 7 counts as its lair, granting it Lair Actions. \"LA\" refers to its Legendary Actions. It uses the following tactics in and out of combat:": "{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 是一个来自异世界的顶级捕食者。第7区被视为它的巢穴，使其获得巢穴行动。\"LA\"指的是它的传奇行动。它在战斗内外使用以下战术：",

	"When prey escape its grasp, the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} uses its Vanish LA to flee and set up another ambush. Likewise, it runs down prey with its Teleport LA.": "当猎物逃脱它的控制时，{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 使用它的消失（Vanish）LA 逃跑并设立另一个伏击。同样地，它用传送（Teleport）LA 追捕猎物。",
	"As a predator, the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} cares only to snatch up one character and escape with its meal, utilizing its Teleport LA to do so. It can easily outpace most characters. Gaining altitude is more important than gaining lateral distance so that any pursuers must fly, and any prey are faced with a steep drop if they untangle themselves from the {@creature balhannoth|MTF}.": "作为捕食者，{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 只关心抓住一个角色并带着食物逃走，利用其传送生物能力来做到这一点。它可以轻松地超越大多数角色。获得高度比获得横向距离更重要，这样任何追赶者都必须飞行，而任何猎物如果从{@creature balhannoth|MTF}中解脱出来，将面临陡峭的下坡。",
	"As its lair actions aren't especially useful in combat, the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} is willing to stray from its lair once the party has shattered its illusion; it prefers to go to Area 5 so that it can {@action grapple|PHB} a character and teleport to above the sinkhole (which is a 60-foot drop from the ceiling).": "由于它的巢穴动作在战斗中并不特别有用，{@creature balhannoth|MTF}一旦被队伍打破了幻象，就愿意离开巢穴；它更喜欢前往5区，这样它就可以{@action grapple|PHB}一个角色并传送到洞穴上方（距离天花板有60英尺的下沉洞）。",

	"The {@creature behir|MM} is still a factor in Level 11.

	"Whether its target is alone or with allies, the {@creature behir|MM} casts {@spell sleep}; it has advantage on its next attack roll, which is a critical hit if the {@creature behir|MM} attacks from within 5 ft. It might also bake the target with its Lightning Breath, whose Dexterity saving throw they automatically fail while {@condition unconscious}.": "无论目标是独自一人还是与盟友一起，{@creature behir|MM}施放{@spell sleep}; 它在下一次攻击投掷中获得优势，如果{@creature behir|MM}在5英尺内进行攻击，则为暴击。它还可以用闪电吐息烤焦目标，其敏捷豁免投掷在{@condition unconscious}期间自动失败。",
	"Targets that aren't put asleep are then {@condition blinded} by a {@spell color spray} spell; the {@creature behir|MM} then gains advantage on attack rolls against these targets.": "没有被使眠的目标随后被{@condition blinded}咒语影响；然后施法者获得对这些目标的攻击投掷有利的优势。",
	"Once the {@creature behir|MM} has constricted and swallowed a target, it flees, using its legendary actions to inhibit the party and escape. If it has its way, it finds a winding crevasse 40 feet up in the cavern and goes 70 feet deep. Creatures that dare clamber into the crevasse are punished with a Lightning Breath.": "一旦{@creature behir|MM}约束并吞噬了目标，它会逃走，利用其传奇动作来阻碍队伍并逃跑。如果它得逞，它会找到一个在洞穴中40英尺高处并且深达70英尺的蜿蜒裂缝。那些敢于爬进裂缝的生物会受到闪电吐息的惩罚。",
	"The minutes swell into hours as you clamber down from {@creature Muiral|WDMM|Muiral's} Gauntlet.

	"If you use this temple as the beast's lair, read the following description:": "如果你把这座寺庙当作野兽的巢穴，阅读以下描述：",
	"You stumble into that which you least suspected to find in these wretched warrens: a temple devoted not to the vile {@creature drow|MM} gods, not to the {@creature troglodyte|MM|troglodytes'} deities, but to a god of light. Imagery of the rising sun can be found everywhere. Pews line a central chapel and cold sconces seem to beg for fresh fire. You feel at peace here—as if at last you've found respite after such a harsh and bitter journey.": "你意外地闯入了这个可怕的地下迷宫中最不可思议的发现：一个并非致力于邪恶{@creature drow|MM}神灵，也非{@creature troglodyte|MM|troglodytes'}神明，而是一个光明之神的神庙。到处都是日出的意象。长椅排列在中央礼拜堂，冰冷的烛台似乎在恳求点燃新的火焰。你在这里感到平静，仿佛终于在经历了如此艰难和痛苦的旅程后找到了休憩之所。",
	"Under this scene, the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} clings to the vaulted ceilings and can traverse between rafters. The ceiling stands up to 50 feet in height, just like Area 7's original dimensions.": "在这个场景下，{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 紧贴着拱形天花板，并可以在横梁之间移动。天花板高达50英尺，就像7区域的原始尺寸一样。",
	"The illusory front line's purpose was still to keep the hardy {@creature troglodyte|MM|troglodytes} in check, but the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} has changed that. Now the {@creature drow|MM} are stationed here to keep an eye on the beast. Keep everything the same, including the {@creature troglodyte|MM} {@creature zombie|MM|zombies}, with exception to Orl Telenna. The {@creature drow|MM} is shell-shocked and nearly mad after such frequent telepathic contact with the {@creature balhannoth|MTF}.": "幻觉前线的目的仍然是控制强壮的{@creature troglodyte|MM|troglodytes}，但{@creature balhannoth|MTF}已经改变了这一点。现在{@creature drow|MM}被驻扎在这里，以监视这个野兽。保持一切不变，包括{@creature troglodyte|MM} {@creature zombie|MM|zombies}，唯独奥尔·泰伦纳除外。在与{@creature balhannoth|MTF}频繁的心灵联系之后，{@creature drow|MM}受到了严重的打击，几乎疯狂了。",
	"So close to its lair, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} can attack here. If it hasn't accosted the party twice already, it ambushes the party. Orl Telenna can sense it coming; he's become sensitive to its presence after such frequent telepathic contact. When it approaches, he screams and casts {@spell rope trick}. An adventurer can use their reaction to make a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw to clamber up the rope after Orl, finding sanctuary in his pocket dimension. Those that fail are too slow; Orl pulls the rope in before the others can climb up. He struggles against those that would reopen the entrance to outsiders, fearing that the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} can slip inside (it can't). The beast flees if it loses a quarter of its hit points.": "如此接近它的巢穴，{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 在这里发动攻击并不令人惊讶。如果它已经两次袭击了队伍，它会埋伏队伍。奥尔·泰伦纳能感觉到它的到来；在频繁的心灵接触之后，他对它的存在变得敏感起来。当它靠近时，他尖叫着施展{@spell rope trick}。冒险者可以利用自己的反应力进行{@dc 13} 敏捷豁免检定，试图爬上绳子跟随奥尔进入他的口袋维度避难。那些失败的人太慢了；在其他人爬上来之前，奥尔把绳子收了起来。他与那些想要重新打开入口让外人进入的人斗争，担心{@creature balhannoth|MTF} 会溜进来（它不能）。如果它失去四分之一的生命值，那兽就会逃走。",
	"The {@creature drow|MM} have always wondered why the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} never approaches this area, despite being so close to its lair. They've a working theory that the beast detests the presence of their {@creature Shadow Demon|MM|shadow demons}. The {@creature drow|MM} are right, and if these demons are slain or removed, the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} quickly adds these caves to its territory.": "{@creature drow|MM}一直在想为什么{@creature balhannoth|MTF}从来不靠近这个地区，尽管它的巢穴如此之近。他们有一个工作理论，认为这个怪兽厌恶他们的存在。{@creature drow|MM}是正确的，如果这些恶魔被杀死或驱赶走，{@creature balhannoth|MTF}会迅速将这些洞穴纳入自己的领地。",
	"Without the demons, the adventurers are liable to an attack by the beast. It tries to push them towards Area 10, wherein it {@action grapple|PHB|grapples} its prey and teleports to above the sinkhole, so that any that manage to untangle themselves are punished with a 60-foot fall (taking {@damage 6d6} bludgeoning damage).": "没有恶魔的情况下，冒险者们很可能会遭到野兽的攻击。它试图将他们推向区域10，在那里它{@action grapple|PHB|grapples}猎物并传送到洞穴上方，以便任何设法挣脱的人都会受到惩罚，从60英尺高的地方摔下（受到{@damage 6d6}的钝击伤害）。",
	"Neither the {@creature behir|MM} nor the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} can tolerate this place so long as the strange runes exist. {@creature troll|MM|Trolls} are already tough enough prey when not altered by weird magic. They won't follow the party here.": "只要奇怪的符文存在，{@creature behir|MM}和{@creature balhannoth|MTF}都无法忍受这个地方。{@creature troll|MM|Trolls}在没有被奇异魔法改变时已经足够强大。他们不会跟随队伍来到这里。",
	"Glowing runes light this fanged cavern whose stalagmites resemble the Mad Mage himself, as if they were lazily carved statues. His carved robe is covered in lidless eyes; he's screaming at some distant horror thankfully invisible to you. Those forlorn runes float above every stalagmite.": "发光的符文照亮了这个长着尖牙的洞穴，它的石笋看起来像是疯狂法师本人，仿佛是懒洋洋地雕刻成的雕像。他雕刻的长袍上布满了无眼的眼睛；他正对着某个幸运地对你不可见的可怕事物尖叫着。那些可怜的符文漂浮在每个石笋上方。",
	"You absolutely must have the magic gate mentioned in WDMM spring into existence whilst the party is here. Read the following when it does:": "当派对在这里时，绝对必须让《WDMM》中提到的魔法之门出现。当它出现时，请阅读以下内容：",
	"The runes begin to glow, spin—the stalagmites of the Mad Mage begin to howl with fear and madness. A wind! A wind surges through the cavern, sucked into a yawning rift that glows violet and pink! As you steel yourselves for the horrors surely to come, that rift reshapes itself into an arcane gate and the first thing you hear from its strange and unwelcome depths are—roosters?": "符文开始发光，旋转——疯狂法师的石笋开始因恐惧和疯狂而咆哮。一阵风！一股风澎湃地穿过洞穴，被吸入一个发出紫色和粉色光芒的张开裂缝！当你们为即将到来的恐怖做好准备时，那个裂缝重新塑造成一个奥术之门，从其奇异而不受欢迎的深处传来的第一声声音是——公鸡？",
	"Half a dozen roosters spill out from the rift, squawking madly. You scratch your head, once again disappointed in whatever life choices led you to Undermountain—": "半打公鸡从裂缝中涌出，疯狂地啼叫着。你挠了挠头，再次对自己的生活选择感到失望，不知为何会来到《地下山》（Undermountain）这个地方。",
	"A roar interrupts your lamentations! Out from the gate stumble at least three {@creature troll|MM|trolls}, their hunger plain to see!": "一声吼叫打断了你的悲叹！至少有三个{@creature troll|MM|trolls}从大门中蹒跚而出，它们的饥饿显而易见！",
	"The sounds of war remind you of the world above—the futility of clashing armies, the crash of ideology, of steel, of men. Cries and curses are shouted in {@language Elvish|PHB}, shouted above the din of {@creature drow|MM} and demons. The cavern is painted under the strobing lights of {@spell faerie fire} spells; crossbow bolts fly and demons battle: a toadlike demon is fighting off two mosquito-like abominations while {@creature drow|MM} fire at each other from their dug-in trenches.": "战争的声音让你想起了地面上的世界——冲突军队的无效、意识形态的冲突、钢铁和人类的碰撞。呼喊和咒骂在{@language Elvish|PHB}中被喊出，盖过了{@creature drow|MM}和恶魔的喧嚣声。洞穴在{@spell faerie fire}法术闪烁的光线下被描绘出来；弩箭飞射，恶魔搏斗：一个类似蟾蜍的恶魔正在与两只类似蚊子的可憎生物搏斗，而{@creature drow|MM}则从他们掩体中相互射击。",
	"With the {@creature behir|MM} in the southwest and the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} in the northeast, this cavern has become the focal point of the {@creature drow|MM|drow's} war. Amp it up as a veritable No Man's Land, replete with trenches, mud, and corpses. Drastically inflate the number of {@creature drow|MM} here, adding them to the trenches. If the adventurers involve themselves in the battle, these extra {@creature drow|MM} are not included in the fight. Likewise, they're too focused on their foes to do anything but fire crossbow bolts if they pass through the middle portion of the cavern.": "随着{@creature behir|MM}位于西南方和{@creature balhannoth|MTF}位于东北方，这个洞穴已成为{@creature drow|MM|drow's}战争的焦点。将其升级为真正的无人区，充满战壕、泥浆和尸体。大幅增加这里的{@creature drow|MM}数量，并将它们添加到战壕中。如果冒险者参与战斗，这些额外的{@creature drow|MM}不参与战斗。同样，他们对敌人太过专注，除非穿过洞穴中部，否则他们只能射击十字弩。",
	"The battle the party happens upon was expected to be another fruitless, indecisive standstill. House Auvryndar, however, comes out ahead, barring any intervention by the party. The armies are unaware that both the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} and the {@creature behir|MM} are pressing in on them, gobbling up elves and claiming territory. The {@creature drow|MM} are too consumed with their petty war to realize that they're doomed.": "当队伍遇到的战斗预料之中地又是一场无果的僵持。然而，奥维恩达家族（House Auvryndar）却取得了优势，除非队伍干预。军队们并不知道{@creature balhannoth|MTF}和{@creature behir|MM}正在向他们逼近，吞噬着精灵并夺取领土。{@creature drow|MM}太过于沉迷于他们的小打小闹，无法意识到他们的命运已经注定。",
	"Six-foot-deep trenches have been dug on both ends of the caverns. Drow pepper each other with crossbow bolts from the relative safety of their hidey holes. These trenches face north-south. There are seven rows to each side, each won and lost count-less times.": "洞穴的两端挖了六英尺深的壕沟。黑暗精灵在他们藏身处相对安全地用十字弓箭相互攻击。这些壕沟朝南北方向。每边有七排，每一排都赢过输过无数次。",
	"The narrower passage between each larger cavern of Area 12 is filled with mud and corpses. It counts as {@quickref difficult terrain|PHB|3}.": "在12号区域每个较大洞穴之间的狭窄通道都被泥浆和尸体填满。这算作{@quickref difficult terrain|PHB|3}。",
	"If the adventurers choose neither side and aim only to skirt by, they're hit as collateral damage from stray spells and happened upon by enemies. Choose any of the following encounters:": "如果冒险者选择不支持任何一方，只是试图绕过，他们会被误打误撞的法术伤到，并被敌人发现。选择以下任何一场遭遇：",
	"A stray {@spell fireball|PHB} ({@dc 14}) cast by Spirreth Dalambra, the House Freth leader; a well-aimed arrow found his shoulder, causing his spell to go awry.": "一支由自由家族领袖斯皮瑞斯·达兰布拉(Spirreth Dalambra)释放的{@spell fireball|PHB}({@dc 14})魔法被一支精准的箭射中肩膀，导致他的法术失灵。",
	"A stray crossbow bolt ({@hit 4} to hit, with advantage, {@damage 1d6 + 2} piercing damage, and a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw from {@item drow poison|DMG} (see the {@creature drow|MM} statblock for details)).": "一支迷失的十字弩弓箭（{@hit 4} 命中，带有优势，造成{@damage 1d6 + 2} 穿刺伤害，并需要进行{@item drow poison|DMG} 的{@dc 13} 体质豁免检定（详情请参见{@creature drow|MM} 的属性块）。",
	"A squad of {@dice 1d4 + 2} {@creature drow|MM} led by a {@creature drow elite warrior|MM} that mistake the party as mercenaries hired by their enemies.": "一支由{@dice 1d4 + 2}个{@creature drow|MM}组成的小队，由一名{@creature drow elite warrior|MM}领导，他们错误地将该队伍误认为是被他们的敌人雇佣的雇佣兵。",
	"A freshly summoned {@creature chasme|MM} off to reinforce the front-line or flank its summoners' enemies.": "一个新召唤出来的{@creature chasme|MM}前往增援前线或者包抄其召唤者的敌人。",
	"A pair of {@creature giant spider|MM|giant spiders} that descend from the ceiling to dine on hapless fools.": "一对从天花板上降下来吃掉不幸的愚人的{@creature giant spider|MM|giant spiders}。",
	"This cavern is jungled with spidery webs within which squawk and chirp captured bats and lizards and stirges—those flying rat/mosquito abominations. Instinctively, you ready yourself for giant arachnids and cocooned victims.": "这个洞穴里到处都是长满蜘蛛网的，里面传来被捕蝙蝠、蜥蜴和吸血蝙蝠发出的尖叫和啁啾声。本能地，你为迎接巨大的蜘蛛和被裹尸的受害者做好了准备。",
	"Whilst here, the party hears the thunderous comings-and-goings of the {@creature behir|MM} in distant caverns. At your discretion, it can enter this area via a winding passage 25 feet from the cavern's floor. It scrambles down the walls under a spell of {@spell invisibility}, attacking the adventurers. It flees when it's lost a quarter of its maximum hit points. Likewise, if it can swallow a character, it retreats through that same passage, which empties out in A17D.": "在这里，冒险小组听到了远处洞穴中{@creature behir|MM}的雷鸣般来来往往。由你决定，它可以通过距离洞穴地面25英尺的蜿蜒通道进入这个区域。它沿着{@spell invisibility}的咒语攀爬墙壁，袭击冒险者。当它失去最大生命值的四分之一时，它会逃走。同样，如果它能吞下一个角色，它会通过同一通道撤退，通道通往A17D。",
	"The {@creature drow|MM} here have been spared the psychological torment of being so close to the {@creature balhannoth|MTF}. Their only concern has been the {@creature behir|MM}, which has yet to visit their cavern—which is about to change.": "这里的{@creature drow|MM}已经被免除了与{@creature balhannoth|MTF}如此接近而遭受心理折磨的命运。他们唯一的担忧是{@creature behir|MM}，但这个地方还没有被他们的洞穴所拜访—这将很快改变。",
	"The {@creature behir|MM|behir's} thunderous approach betrays its presence while the party is here. It cannot surprise them; however it comes under a spell of {@spell invisibility}, granting it advantage on its first attack. Likewise, the cavern's acoustics are so indulgent that its thunder actually masks where it specifically is, negating any advantage the party might have at locating the {@creature behir|MM}. When the {@creature behir|MM} attacks, the {@creature drow|MM} instinctively flee, leaving the adventurers to deal with the beast.": "{@creature behir|MM|behir's}那震耳欲聋的隆隆声透露了它的存在，当派对在这里时。它无法让他们感到惊讶；然而，它受到了{@spell invisibility}的咒语影响，使其在第一次攻击时获得优势。同样，洞穴的声学效果如此慷慨，以至于它的雷声实际上掩盖了它具体的位置，消除了派对可能在定位{@creature behir|MM}方面的任何优势。当{@creature behir|MM}发动攻击时，{@creature drow|MM}本能地逃离，将冒险者留给野兽应对。",
	"Unlike the {@creature balhannoth|MTF}, the {@creature behir|MM} doesn't tolerate any intruders to its lair. It fights with wild abandon and will pursue prey that flee from this area unless it's severely wounded. No changes are necessary.": "与{@creature balhannoth|MTF}不同，{@creature behir|MM}不容忍任何闯入其巢穴的人。它会疯狂地战斗，并会追击逃离该区域的猎物，除非它受了严重的伤。",
	"When the party first finds the pathway to Level 12, the {@creature behir|MM} either comes storming out from the path—driving them back into Level 11 proper—or forces them downward. Dealer's choice.": "当冒险队首次发现通往12级的路径时，{@creature behir|MM}要么从路径中冲出来，将他们逼回到11级，要么迫使他们向下。由荷官决定。",
	"You can run this special event for Level 11—or rather your players can orchestrate it:": "你可以为11级角色举办这个特殊事件—或者说你的玩家们可以策划它：",
	"The adventurers can engineer a conflict between the {@creature behir|MM} and the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} by luring both to the same cavern, such as Area 6, the heart of the warrens. The two apex predators immediately duke it out, pausing only to strike back at bystanders that attack them. Once this conflict begins, a legion of {@spell arcane eye|PHB|arcane eyes} appear in the cavern to film the event. The Mad Mage himself appears to shoutcast the fight. He quickly applauds the adventurers for engineering the fight, which he features on his hit, transplanar gameshow, Dungeon of the Mad Mage.": "冒险者可以在{@creature behir|MM}和{@creature balhannoth|MTF}之间制造冲突，诱使它们都来到同一个洞穴，比如区域6，战争之地的核心。这两只顶级掠食者立即展开激烈的对决，只在被攻击时才会暂停反击旁观者。一旦这场冲突开始，一群{@spell arcane eye|PHB|arcane eyes}出现在洞穴中拍摄这一事件。疯狂法师本人出现在现场为这场战斗进行解说。他迅速为冒险者的策划点赞，并将这场战斗展示在他的跨平面热门游戏节目《疯狂法师的地牢》中。",

	"Ultimately, the {@creature behir|MM} wins out against its opponent. The {@creature balhannoth|MTF} tries to flee, but the {@creature behir|MM} runs it down with constant {@spell misty step} spells and its greater movement speed. Likewise, the {@creature behir|MM} blasts at the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} from behind with its Lightning Breath. When the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} dies, Halaster approaches the {@creature behir|MM} and strokes it lovingly, as if it were a dog—which it is to him. Looking into the {@spell arcane eye|PHB|arcane eyes}, he declares tonight a true \"clash of the titans\" and promises another match one day soon.": "最终，{@creature behir|MM}战胜了对手。{@creature balhannoth|MTF}试图逃跑，但{@creature behir|MM}通过持续的{@spell misty step}法术和更快的移动速度追赶上了它。同样，{@creature behir|MM}从背后向{@creature balhannoth|MTF}放出闪电吐息。当{@creature balhannoth|MTF}死去时，哈拉斯特走近{@creature behir|MM}，爱抚着它，就像对待一只狗一样——对他来说，它就是一只狗。凝视着{@spell arcane eye|PHB|arcane eyes}，他宣布今晚是一场真正的“泰坦之战”，并承诺不久将来举行另一场比赛。",

	"Having good reason to believe that Halaster is more than mortal, Erelal Freth once struck a bargain with him. In return for a favor long already cashed in, she could force him to agree to one request of her choosing. She's thus engineered this wedding to ensure that that agreement is to be her subservient husband and lend both legitimacy and power to her claim over Undermountain.": "有充分理由相信哈拉斯特(Halaster)不是凡人，厄拉尔·弗雷斯(Erelal Freth)曾经与他达成过一笔交易。作为一项早已兑现的恩惠，她可以强迫他同意她选择的一个请求。因此，她策划了这场婚礼，确保协议是让他成为她的顺从丈夫，为她对安德山(Undermountain)的主张提供合法性和权力。",
	"Erelal's wrong. Very wrong. Halaster is no fey or fiend bound by cosmic law and deals past rendered. Were this to be even the true Halaster, he could simply renege. Alas, she hasn't even got that part right and has captured the Mad Mage's {@spell simulacrum}.": "Erelal错了。非常错误。哈拉斯特(Halaster)不是被宇宙法律束缚的仙灵或恶魔，也不是过去所达成的交易。即使这是真正的哈拉斯特，他也可以轻易食言。可惜，她甚至连这一点都搞错了，已经俘虏了疯狂法师{@spell simulacrum}。",
	"{@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim} was created by Halaster to entertain guests or fulfill commitments he himself couldn't be bothered with. He's forgotten {@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim's} very existence and would surely destroy him if he remembered. {@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim}, who frankly enjoys existing, does his best to sneak under the Mad Mage's radar.

	"{@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim} shares much of Halaster's personality, but little of his power or insanity. His power is capped, per the {@spell simulacrum} spell, and his attachment to the Knot in the Weave is virtually nonexistent. He's thus much less powerful than the true Mad Mage. Since Erelal Freth is sure to destroy him if she learns the truth, he only shares that truth with would-be rescuers.": "{@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim} 与哈拉斯特(Halaster)的个性很相似，但他的力量和疯狂却少之又少。根据{@spell simulacrum}法术，他的力量被限制了，而他对编织之结的依恋几乎不存在。因此，他远不及真正的疯狂法师强大。由于埃瑞拉尔·弗雷斯(Erelal Freth)如果得知真相肯定会摧毁他，所以他只会与那些希望拯救他的人分享这个真相。",
	"If you're running the {@i Companion's} game show element, {@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim} is aware of the show.

	"As a {@spell simulacrum}, {@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim} is severely handicapped, explaining his capture and meekness: he cannot regain hit points except in an alchemical laboratory, forcing him to avoid confrontations; he can't ever regain expended spell slots, many of which he's wasted over the years, effectively reducing him to a 7th-level spellcaster; and he lacks the capacity to learn, meaning he will never increase in power. All in all, this creates a meek, feeble, and terrified version of the infamous Mad Mage.": "作为一个{@spell simulacrum}，{@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim}严重受损，解释了他被捕获和懦弱的原因：他除非在炼金实验室中才能恢复生命值，迫使他避免与人对抗；他永远无法恢复已用掉的法术位，其中许多年来被浪费掉，实际上将他降为了一个7级法术施法者；而且他缺乏学习的能力，意味着他永远不会增加力量。总的来说，这创造了一个懦弱、虚弱和恐惧的版本，这个臭名昭著的疯狂法师(Mad Mage)。",
	"{@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim} has pestered Erelal into inviting the party to the wedding; one is due to be his best man. These invitations can be found floating throughout the level.

The nuptials shall be fierce!\"": "{@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim}已经不断地纠缠着Erelal，要求邀请整个队伍参加婚礼；其中一人将成为他的伴郎。这些邀请函可以在整个层次中找到。一旦触摸到邀请函，一个幻象会显现出他们的形象，{@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim's}的声音喊道：“冒险者们！你们被诚挚邀请参加我的婚礼！{@creature drow|MM}不会伤害你们，只要你们带着这份邀请！前往蜘蛛守望堡！婚礼将会激烈异常！”",

	"Erelal truly believes she's ensnared Halaster through a clever twist of their old bargain. She is not kind to her fiancé, keeping him locked up in Area 19K. She takes sick pleasure in berating, humiliating, and lording over him. She shows him off as a trophy, proudly saying she's captured \"the infamous Mad Mage.\" Together, she promises, they'll have plenty of half-elf children, whom she glowingly refers to as future demi-gods—for she believes Halaster to be more than mortal.": "Erelal真心地相信她通过一个巧妙的方式，将Halaster纠缠在了他们旧协议的扭曲中。她对她的未婚夫并不友善，将他关在19K区域里。她享受着责骂、羞辱和高高在上地对待他的快感。她把他展示出来，像展示一个奖杯一样，自豪地说她俘获了“臭名昭著的疯狂法师”。她承诺他们会一起拥有许多混血儿，她兴高采烈地称他们为未来的半神，因为她相信Halaster不仅仅是凡人。",

Since the Shadowdusks have already made the Mad Mage's offer of apprenticeship, he understands that {@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim} is not who he claims to be—but rather than suspecting him to be a {@spell simulacrum}, he thinks Halaster is just playing some strange game. He also thinks that this marriage is a means to sweeten Halaster's deal.

A faux sun even rises above Spiderwatch Keep, nearly blinding all the {@creature drow|MM}.": "一旦哈拉斯特（Halaster）做出他的宏伟揭示，他挥动手臂，使{@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim}变得如同冰一般透明。他咯咯笑着称埃瑞拉尔（Erelal）为傻瓜——随着她的愤怒升腾，奇异的魔法开始在蜘蛛守望堡（Spiderwatch Keep）中生效：眼睛在墙壁、塔楼上生长；烟花冲入空中；在18G区和18H区被囚禁的{@creature goblin|MM|goblins}和{@creature troglodyte|MM|troglodytes}被传送到庭院，他们的锁链系在一个欢乐的五月柱上，五月柱的顶端坐着一个微型的哈拉斯特。{@creature drow|MM}守卫们从塔楼中尖叫着冲出来，或者从屋顶上摔下来，额头和腋窝长出触手状附肢。甚至在蜘蛛守望堡上方升起了一个人造太阳，几乎让所有{@creature drow|MM}眩目。",
	"As this all unfolds, read the following:": "当一切揭晓时，请阅读以下内容：",

	"The Mad Mage leans forward, fresh with a grin—and Erelal crumbles to her knees. Her wedding dress has grown wet and her face contorts with pain. \"You asked me to marry you, my dear,\" Halaster says, \"and remember: it's 'til death do we part.\"": "疯狂法师向前倾身，脸上带着灿烂的笑容——而Erelal跪倒在地。她的婚纱已经被浸湿，脸上扭曲着痛苦。“你曾经请求我娶你，亲爱的，”Halaster说道，“记住：直到死亡将我们分开。”",
	"As Erelal goes into magically induced, premature labor, Halaster pulls out a dagger and goes to gut {@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim} ({@hit 11} to hit, {@damage 1d4 + 4} piercing damage). If he reduces {@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim} to 0 hit points, the {@spell simulacrum} melts as snow.

	"Whenever Halaster leaves, it's with Erelal. One moment she's there, the next she's gone. A scrap of paper floats where she once stood and reads, \"Best accept that offer now.\" This refers to {@creature Drivvin Freth|WDMM|Drivvin's} offer of apprenticeship under the Mad Mage. With his sister (and her baby) held hostage, the elf has no choice but to accept. The remaining elves' spirits are too broken by the abduction of their matriarch to offer any violence to the adventurers, who are free to go.": "每当哈拉斯特（Halaster）离开时，都会带着艾瑞拉（Erelal）。她刚刚还在那里，下一刻就消失了。一张纸片飘落在她曾经站立的地方，上面写着：“最好现在接受那个提议。”这指的是{@creature Drivvin Freth|WDMM|Drivvin's}接受疯狂法师（Mad Mage）的学徒提议。由于他的姐姐（和她的宝宝）被扣为人质，这位精灵别无选择，只能接受。剩下的精灵因为族长被绑架而精神崩溃，无法对冒险者们施加任何暴力，他们可以自由离开。",

The stench of rot and death is everywhere, brought in a roiling fog that kills visibility. You can hardly see more than an arm's reach.": "Warrens（战栈）的恶臭已经渗入了你的衣服，带来了粪便和腐肉的气味——在这个新的深处，情况更是如此。腐烂和死亡的气味无处不在，被一股滚滚的雾气带来，使能见度降低。你几乎看不到超过一只手臂的距离。",

This is your last vacation before my true game begins.\"": "“欢迎，”疯狂法师在你的脑海中宣布，“来到迷宫层：在这里{@creature Minotaur|MM|minotaurs}向他们哑巴领主{@creature Baphomet|MTF}祈祷，却毫无意义。在这里，弗雷斯家族的{@creature drow|MM}敢于密谋夺取我的领地。很少有人深入其中，更少有人返回。我邀请你欣赏这里的景色、气味，并享受你在这里的时光。这是你在我的真正游戏开始之前的最后一次度假。”",
	"Before the adventurers leave Area 1, they hear the {@creature bore worm|WDMM} in Area 13 as it comes up from Level 13.": "在冒险者离开1区之前，他们听到从13级升起的声音，声音是{@creature bore worm|WDMM}。",
	"Amidst the fog looms the rusted remains of some construct. Much of its body has been stolen away, but some parts remain like the discarded metal guts of a corpse. Its head is like an empty helm left behind on a red battlefield. After close inspection, you find an inscription in {@language Elvish|PHB}.": "在雾气中，一些构造物的锈迹斑斑。它的大部分身体已经被盗走，但仍有一些部分保留下来，就像一具尸体的抛弃金属内脏。它的头部就像是留在红色战场上的空头盔。经过仔细检查，你发现了一个{@language Elvish|PHB}语言的铭文。",
	"The destroyed {@creature shield guardian|MM} was a gift from Erelal Freth to her brother {@creature Drivvin Freth|WDMM|Drivvin}. The inscription reads, in {@language Elvish|PHB}, \"To dearest {@creature Drivvin Freth|WDMM|Drivvin}, may this guardian protect your virtue.

	"You can add some weight to the {@item lute|PHB} found here. If you're aware of any adventurers' acquaintances that might have been kidnapped by Houses Auvryndar or Freth and brought to Undermountain, like the Sing-Alongs, the nabbed halfling quintet on Level 10, then attach a different name to the {@item lute|PHB}. Otherwise, this Korynn was a well-known musician in Waterdeep, whose acquaintance was earned by one of the party members (such as {@class Bard|PHB|bards}, or characters of the {@background Entertainer} backgrounds). Award {@variantrule inspiration|DMG} if the player really bites into it, roleplaying their sorrow. Alternatively, they may have met him in Skullport. If they return with news of his death, his widow, Gloria, awards them 10 gp.": "你可以在这里找到{@item lute|PHB}，为其增加一些重量。如果你知道有任何冒险者的熟人可能被奥文达尔家族或弗雷斯家族绑架并带到地下山，比如“歌唱家”(Sing-Alongs)，在第10层被抓的半身人五重奏，那么将一个不同的名字附加到{@item lute|PHB}上。否则，这位科林(Korynn)是沃特德普(Waterdeep)一位知名音乐家，其熟人是该队中的一名成员（比如{@class Bard|PHB|bards}，或者{@background Entertainer}背景的角色）。如果玩家真的投入其中，扮演出他们的悲伤，奖励{@variantrule inspiration|DMG}。或者，他们可能在头颅港(Skullport)遇见他。如果他们带着他去世的消息回来，他的遗孀格洛丽亚(Gloria)会奖励他们10金币。",
	"If any adventurer came to Undermountain to seek out an old friend, change this \"Korynn\" to fit that, if possible. They've found no corpse yet, so it's still possible he lives; perhaps he's a prisoner of the {@creature drow|MM}?": "如果有任何冒险者来到地下山洞寻找一位老朋友，将“Korynn”更改为适合的名字，如果可能的话。他们还没有找到尸体，所以他还有可能活着；也许他是{@creature drow|MM}的囚犯？",

	"The Mad Mage has trapped this passage with one of his favorite antics: a Large steel, half-sentient steel boulder. Once characters reach the dead end, the trap animates. It's an improved version of Halaster's Crushing Eye from Level 2. Halaster has emblazoned a confusing image on the boulder; while it's rolling, characters notice that it forms a moving picture of Halaster cackling.": "疯狂法师用他最喜欢的把戏之一——一个大型的钢制、半有意识的钢石块——困住了这段通道。一旦角色们到达死胡同，陷阱就会被激活。这是哈拉斯特在2层的压碎之眼的改进版本。哈拉斯特在石块上刻上了一个令人困惑的图像；当石块滚动时，角色们会注意到它形成了一个移动的哈拉斯特发笑的画面。",
	"Halaster, of course, is a kind and benevolent tyrant that will forewarn passerby of this trap. When characters enter the dead-end passageway, his voice echoes off the stones to say: \"Turn back! Begone or be dead!\" When the boulder is released, it comes through the stone wall as if it were under a {@spell meld into stone} spell or similar magic.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster），当然，是一个仁慈和慈善的暴君，他会预先警告过路人这个陷阱。当角色进入这条死胡同时，他的声音在石头间回荡：“回头吧！离开，否则就会死！”当巨石被释放时，它穿过石墙，就好像受到了一个{@spell meld into stone}法术或类似魔法的影响。",
	"Once the boulder is released, all present characters roll initiative, including the boulder, with a {@skillCheck initiative 8} bonus to its initiative roll. The boulder has a speed of 60 ft. and doesn't rely on gravity to take it forward. Thanks to its magical nature, it can make turns when needed. On its turn it moves forward; it can move through other creatures' spaces. When it enters a creature's space or a creature enters its space while its rolling, that creature must succeed on a {@dc 15} Dexterity save or take 55 ({@damage 10d10}) bludgeoning damage and also be knocked {@condition prone}.": "一旦巨石被释放，所有在场的角色都要进行先攻检定，包括巨石在内，巨石的先攻检定投掷时获得{@skillCheck initiative 8}的加值。巨石的移动速度为60英尺，不依赖重力前进。由于其具有魔法属性，它可以在需要时转向。在它的回合里，它向前移动；它可以穿过其他生物的空间。当它进入一个生物的空间，或者有生物在它滚动时进入它的空间时，那个生物必须成功通过一个{@dc 15}的敏捷豁免才能避免受到55点({@damage 10d10})的钝击伤害，并且被击倒{@condition prone}。",
	"A creature within 5 feet of the boulder can attempt to slow it down by using an action to make a {@dc 20} Strength check. On a successful check, the boulder's speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the boulder's speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat until the start of its next turn—but any bludgeoning damage it inflicts that turn is reduced to 17 ({@damage 3d10}). It reaches its full speed at the start of its next turn after that, provided no character reduces its speed again.": "一个在巨石5英尺内的生物可以尝试通过使用动作进行一次{@dc 20}力量检定来减缓它的速度。在成功检定后，巨石的速度减少15英尺。如果巨石的速度降至0，它将停止移动，并在下一个回合开始前不再构成威胁—但是它在那个回合造成的任何钝击伤害都减少到17 ({@damage 3d10})。在此之后的下一个回合开始时，它会恢复到全速，前提是没有角色再次减缓它的速度。",
	"Once all creatures vacate the dead-end, the boulder reverses direction and returns to its space behind the stone wall. Halaster's voice shouts, \"I told you so!\"": "当所有生物离开死胡同时，巨石改变方向，返回到石墙后的位置。哈拉斯特的声音喊道：\"我早就告诉过你们！\"",
	"Use the fog to your advantage: remind the party of those other adventurers they've passed or slain. The faces might even whisper or shout at the adventurers, demanding justice or charging them with murder.

The Mad Mage charges the party with returning {@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM|Zox} to Area 7, so that he may resume his work.

	"Despite her cult following, despite carving out power and freedom in the ashes of her exile, Yargoth is unsatisfied with her lot and hounded by doubt. Doubt poisons every decision and every hope. Insanity has bloomed from within her skull, but that wild stallion has been tamed—for now. As insanity rages in its paddock, she cannot help but wonder if her true title is no longer \"the Breaker\" but instead \"the Broken.\" Such fear has made her brittle.": "尽管(Yargoth)拥有一大批追随者，尽管在被放逐的废墟中获得了权力和自由，但她对自己的处境感到不满，并被怀疑所困扰。怀疑毒害着每一个决定和每一个希望。疯狂在她的脑中蔓延，但那匹狂野的雄马已经被驯服了——至少暂时是这样。当疯狂在它的围栏中肆虐时，她不禁想知道自己真正的称号是否不再是“破坏者”，而是“被打破者”。这样的恐惧使她变得脆弱。",
	"Yargoth's plans are in similar disarray: she knows that she must find {@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM} and steal his ring to seize control of the {@creature scaladar|WDMM}, but she has yet to decide whether to use the constructs to satisfy her estranged liege, Doomcrown, or usurp him. Finding the gnome has become her sole mission and the only floodgate holding back true hopelessness.": "Yargoth的计划也陷入了类似的混乱：她知道她必须找到{@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM}并偷走他的戒指来控制{@creature scaladar|WDMM}，但她还没有决定是使用构造体来满足她疏远的领主，末日王冠(Doomcrown)，还是篡位。找到这个侏儒已经成为她唯一的使命，也是阻止真正绝望的唯一闸门。",
	"Under the {@i Companion}, {@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM|Zox's} erratic goals remain the same: to create a vast machine capable of duplicating whatever goes through it.

	"With his ring back, {@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM|Zox} asks the party to take him to Area 12, to check on the myconid colony that sheltered him from the {@creature hobgoblin|MM} raiders. Last he saw of it, the flames were leaping higher and higher. Consumed by guilt, he strikes off for the area with or without the adventurers.

	"When the {@creature hobgoblin|MM|hobgoblins} broke down the doors to his palace, {@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM|Zox's} {@creature shield guardian|MM} held the line—until Yargoth the Breaker cleaved off its head. {@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM|Zox} insists they visit Area 9 to collect enough steel and then visit Area 8 to have the {@creature azer|MM|azers} there smelt him a body for Rex.": "当{@creature hobgoblin|MM|hobgoblins}冲破他的宫殿大门时，{@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM|Zox's} {@creature shield guardian|MM} 顶住阵线 — 直到破坏者亚尔戈斩下它的头颅。{@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM|Zox} 坚持他们去9区收集足够的钢材，然后去8区让那里的{@creature azer|MM|azers} 为雷克斯熔炼一个身体。",
	"With his ring and guardian restored, {@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM|Zox} is ready to return to his palace. However, by now Yargoth (following Halaster's whispers) has gathered her host and is ready to knock down the palace's walls—this time with {@creature Shockerstomper|WDMM} in tow, if the machine wasn't destroyed. She herself drives a {@creature hellfire engine|MTF} stolen from the Nine Hells by Halaster (see Appendix B).": "随着他的戒指和守护者被恢复，{@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM|Zox}准备返回他的宫殿。然而，此时雅戈斯（听从哈拉斯特的耳语）已经聚集了她的部队，并准备推倒宫殿的墙壁——这次如果那台机器没有被摧毁的话，将带着{@creature Shockerstomper|WDMM}一同前来。她本人驾驶着一辆{@creature hellfire engine|MTF}，这辆车是哈拉斯特从九层地狱偷来的（见附录B）。",
	"If {@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM|Zox} survives, Halaster teleports the party from the level. If they fail to protect him, they find the tunnel to Level 14 after {@dice 2d4 + 3} days of wandering the Graveyard or until a player thinks to follow the {@creature bore worm|WDMM|bore worm's} trail—risking a conflict with the great machine.": "如果{@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM|Zox}存活下来，哈拉斯特会将队伍从这一层传送走。如果他们未能保护他，他们将在游荡于墓地{@dice 2d4 + 3}天后，或者直到有玩家想到跟随{@creature bore worm|WDMM|bore worm's}的痕迹，才会找到通往第14层的隧道——这样做会冒着与大机器发生冲突的风险。",
	"This hellscape is dominated by vehicles held together only by hope and duct tape. These vehicles are early inventions of {@creature Trobriand|WDMM}, before Halaster warned him to knock it off. They run off of diesel fuel, which can be harvested from a third pool in Area 9 and found in caches throughout the wastes. They've since been salvaged by the {@creature hobgoblin|MM|hobgoblins}, who don't know how to gain more fuel; only {@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM|Zox} has figured that out.": "这个地狱般的景象被仅靠希望和胶带维持在一起的车辆所主导。这些车辆是{@creature Trobriand|WDMM}的早期发明，在哈拉斯特警告他停止之前制造的。它们以柴油为燃料，可以从第9区的第三个池塘中提取，并在荒地中的储藏中找到。它们后来被{@creature hobgoblin|MM|hobgoblins}所打捞，他们不知道如何获得更多燃料；只有{@creature Zox Clammersham|WDMM|Zox}已经弄清楚了。",
	"Simplicity's the norm for these vehicles. Vehicles are made of two parts: the body and the wheels, each with an AC and hit point maximum.

To hell with the {@creature hobgoblin|MM|hobgoblins}, the {@creature Fire Giant|MM|fire giants}, and all their hard work, the Mad Mage thinks.

	"Halaster prevents the party from leaving Arcturiadoom by sealing the exits with a {@spell wish} spell. However, the weapon cannot affect creatures in zones of antimagic (such as Areas 4 and 32) or those that get to Area 37. If the party chooses to follow through with this plan, let them.

	"It's once the adventurers enter Area 3 that Halaster lays this challenge at the feet of the party. An alarm blares throughout the level, but only the contestants can hear it; all other creatures are completely unaware of their impending doom.

	"For once, time is of the essence and the adventurers might find themselves dusted if they take too long searching for keys or fighting foes. Without making it a chore, track time with these principles:": "有时候，时间至关重要，冒险者们如果花太多时间寻找钥匙或与敌人战斗，可能会发现自己被埋没。在不让其变成一项琐事的情况下，可以通过以下原则来追踪时间：",
	"Timekeeping must be as straight forward and transparent as possible. Use ten tokens, notes, or some other visual aid such as a clock to show your players approximately how much time has passed since the WMD was armed.": "时间记录必须尽可能直接和透明。使用十个代币、笔记，或其他视觉辅助工具，比如时钟，向玩家展示自大规模杀伤性武器(WMD)被激活以来大约经过了多少时间。",
	"Approximate the length of any conversations the party has with NPCs; there's little time for full negotiations.": "在与NPC（Non-Player Characters）的对话中尽量简洁，没有太多时间进行完整的谈判。",

	"Additionally, choose one of these methods to track time, if you haven't already devised one of your own:": "此外，如果您还没有自己的时间追踪方法，请选择以下其中一种方法：",
	"You can approximate ten minutes of game time for one minute spent in-game. This gives the players one hour and forty minutes to find all the keys. If you're lenient, or your players are notorious dawdlers, extend it to three hours; you know your players best.": "你可以将游戏内的一分钟近似为十分钟的游戏时间。这样玩家们就有一个小时四十分钟的时间来找到所有的钥匙。如果你愿意宽容一点，或者你的玩家以拖拖拉拉著称，可以将时间延长到三个小时；你最了解你的玩家。",
	"The disadvantage to this method is that you need to adjust real-world time for instantaneous events in-game. For example, if the adventurers were to spend thirty precious seconds picking a lock or searching a room, that can be resolved instantly at the table; they wouldn't lose any time unless you subtract that from the hour-forty or three hours (real-time) they have to shut off the WMD. Thus, consider these:": "这种方法的缺点是你需要调整现实时间来处理游戏中的瞬间事件。例如，如果冒险者花了三十秒来撬锁或搜索一个房间，这在桌上可以瞬间解决；他们不会浪费任何时间，除非你从他们关闭WMD所剩的一个小时四十分钟或三个小时（真实时间）中减去这段时间。因此，请考虑这些：",
	"Under the hour-forty model, subtract five minutes from their time for every thirty seconds in-game.": "根据每小时四十分钟模型，在游戏中每30秒减去5分钟。",
	"Under the three-hour model, subtract nine minutes from their time for every thirty seconds in-game.": "根据三小时模型，在游戏中每30秒减去他们的时间九分钟。",
	"Attempting to break down a door, pick a lock, search a room or the like on this level takes 30 seconds, without regard to how well or how poorly they rolled. The time it takes for these tasks is often handwaved, but on this level it must be accounted for.": "在这个级别上，试图破门而入、撬锁、搜查房间或类似的动作需要30秒，不论他们掷骰子的好坏。通常这些任务所需的时间会被忽略，但在这个级别上必须予以考虑。",
	"It is highly recommended that you don't track time by movement and initiative. It will grind your game down to a halt. If you do go this way, you masochist, then assume the adventurers are always sprinting—and only use one token to represent the party (or subgroups, if they split up). The irritation of this method is lessened on a virtual tabletop, since distance can be measured quickly. Don't bother asking each player for their turn; they move as a group until presented with anything that would provoke a change, such as investigating a statue or searching a room. Again, this method will be painful—but precise.": "强烈建议不要通过移动和先攻来跟踪时间。这会使你的游戏变得非常缓慢。如果你选择这种方式，你这个虐待狂，那就假设冒险者们一直在全速奔跑——只使用一个标记来代表整个队伍（或者分组，如果他们分开行动）。在虚拟桌面上使用这种方法的烦恼会减轻一些，因为距离可以快速测量。不要费心询问每个玩家轮到他们时要做什么；他们作为一个团队移动，直到遇到任何可能引起变化的事情，比如调查雕像或搜索房间。再次强调，这种方法会很痛苦——但是精确。",
	"Under this method, you're just counting down from 100 and measuring by the number of areas they travel to. When the party moves to an adjacent, nearby area, subtract 1. When moving to a distant area, such as from Area 3 to Area 15, roll a {@dice d4} and subtract the result. For the particularly long areas, like A6, or the long route through Area 14, this die increases to {@dice 1d4+2|d6 with a minimum roll of 3}.": "根据这种方法，你只需从100开始倒数，并根据他们前往的区域数量来测量。当队伍移动到相邻的附近区域时，减去1。当移动到远处的区域，比如从区域3到区域15时，掷出一个{@dice d4}的骰子并减去结果。对于特别长的区域，比如A6，或者穿过区域14的长路线，这个骰子增加到{@dice 1d4+2|d6 with a minimum roll of 3}。",
	"After Halaster's spiel is over in Area 3, where he lays down the challenge and activates {@creature Arcturia|WDMM|Arcturia's} WMD, he leaves a handful of notes with an adventurer that describes how to find the mithral keys.

Look not at the eyed tapestry, but to the crystal door!\"": "J键藏在第13区; Halaster的笔记中提到这把钥匙：\"夹在少女和时间守护者之间，在锻造和黑板之间，在工作和学习之间。不要看着有眼的挂毯，而是看向水晶门!\"",
	"The U key was originally hidden in Area 27 but was found by Vanar Freth and is with him in Area 29; Halaster's notes for this key read: \"A {@creature drow|MM} has infiltrated {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} and has found a key—wouldn't Erelal Freth be proud.

	"Alussiarr, the {@creature rakshasa|MM}, and the two {@creature young blue dragon|MM|young blue dragons} in Area 39 will weather the blast (although barely).

What could that be for, you must wonder—for to wonder about that tapestry of eyes, the one stretched across the wall, the one that gazes at you with burning jealousy, the one that menacingly flaps its living flesh, might just rend your sanity.": "当你走进房间时，你的大脑本能地避开了你的眼睛，本能地避开了不应该存在的东西——因此你首先关注这个房间的其他方面。在你的左边有一扇水晶门。它是蓝色的，透明的。三根黑色石柱——你注意到是玄武岩，非常漂亮，非常漂亮——每根上面都有一个银色的门把手。那可能是用来干什么的，你一定会想——因为去思考那幅眼睛的挂毯，那幅横跨墙壁的挂毯，那个用燃烧的嫉妒凝视着你，那个威胁性地拍动着活肉的挂毯，可能会摧毁你的理智。",
	"Touching any knobs on the pillars represents a huge setback for the adventurers, unless they needed to teleport back to the lair's entrance. Even still, they're liable to the {@spell polymorph} trap in A5.": "触摸柱子上的任何旋钮对冒险者来说都是巨大的挫折，除非他们需要传送回巢穴入口。即便如此，他们仍然可能遭遇A5区域的{@spell polymorph}陷阱。",
	"It makes no sense that the panels are inside the Alteration Chamber, so they're placed here in Area 13A instead.": "在变形室里放置面板毫无意义，所以它们被放置在13A区域内。",
	"The ruined {@creature beholder|MM} is just bored. It's mad with boredom and will give anything for entertainment—alas, it has nothing to give but its own company, and who would want that? Xebekal doesn't want to die, but instead be restored to its \"glorious\" form. During a telepathic conversation, it \"gifts\" participants with visions of its old self disintegrating {@creature drow|MM} and {@creature goblin|MM|goblins}, carving great chasms with its eye rays, and generally lording over \"lesser\" creatures.": "这个毁灭的{@creature beholder|MM}只是感到无聊。它对无聊感到疯狂，愿意为了娱乐而付出任何代价——可惜，它没有别的可以给予，只有它自己的陪伴，但谁会想要呢？泽贝卡尔不想死，而是希望被恢复到它“辉煌”的形态。在一次心灵感应的对话中，它“赠送”参与者看到它旧时的自我分解{@creature drow|MM}和{@creature goblin|MM|goblins}，用它的眼光刻出巨大的峡谷，并且通常统治着“低等”生物。",
	"Like any sane delver, you look through the glass before entering this strange chamber. The ceiling sports a crystal lamp that sheds a pale light—and at the chamber's heart, you spot a key.": "和任何明智的探险者一样，在进入这个奇怪的房间之前，你透过玻璃看了一眼。天花板上挂着一盏水晶灯，散发着微弱的光芒——在房间的中心，你看到了一把钥匙。",
	"As described above, the brass panels are in Area 13A and not 13B. However, there are buttons inside the chamber that can open or close the crystal door.": "如上所述，黄铜面板位于13A区而不是13B区。然而，室内有按钮可以打开或关闭水晶门。",
	"The mithral key is unprotected—although Xebekal, who sorely needs entertainment, can make mischief. It can occasionally summon enough willpower to press the buttons in 13B telekinetically. It does so now, when adventurers are in the chamber. Roll initiative; Xebekal has a {@skillCheck initiative 2} bonus to its roll. On its first turn, it closes the door; on the next, it presses the left button, shrinking characters inside. It's then satisfied and ceases its tomfoolery, unless the characters reverse the shrinking. Cue a tug-of-war between Xebekal and the adventurers, as it repeatedly shrinks them or shuts the door. As written in WDMM, every time the left or right buttons are pressed, roll a {@dice d6} to see if the chamber malfunctions, damaging all creatures in the chamber. Throughout all this, the tapestry of eyes' eyes blink rapidly and it grunts with exertion.": "这把秘银钥匙毫无保护——尽管急需娱乐的泽贝卡尔可能会捣蛋。它偶尔能够召唤足够的意志力，以念力按下13B的按钮。现在正是这个时候，冒险者们正位于房间内。进行先攻检定；泽贝卡尔在其投掷中获得了{@skillCheck initiative 2}的加值。在它的第一个回合，它关闭了门；接着，它按下了左侧按钮，使房间内的角色缩小。然后，它感到满足并停止捣蛋，除非角色们逆转了缩小的效果。接着是泽贝卡尔和冒险者之间的拉锯战，它会反复缩小他们或关闭门。按照WDMM所述，每次按下左侧或右侧按钮时，进行{@dice d6}的检定，查看房间是否发生故障，对房间内所有生物造成伤害。在这一切过程中，眼睛图案的眼睛会迅速眨动，它会吃力地呻吟。",
	"The doors open upon a massive hall, at least a hundred fifty feet in height, supported by towering stone pillars. A {@creature Fire Giant|MM|fire giantess} paces the hall, grumbling to herself.": "门打开，通向一个巨大的大厅，高度至少一百五十英尺，由高耸的石柱支撑着。一个{@creature Fire Giant|MM|fire giantess}在大厅里踱步，自言自语地抱怨着。",
	"Smack-dab in the middle of the chamber is a giant construct of finely-forged steel, humanoid in shape, a hundred feet tall—and it's still missing a head. Its body is engraved with lid-less eyes and its fists are decorated in unpowered runes. Its open neck bulges with fitted cogs and gears.": "在房间的正中央是一个巨大的精钢构造体，呈人形，高达一百英尺—但它还缺少一个头部。它的身体上刻有无眼的眼睛，拳头上装饰着未激活的符文。它敞开的颈部凸起着配套的齿轮和齿轮。",
	"Even without the head, you know what this is: an iron giant crafted in Halaster's image. A {@creature Mecha-Halaster|WDMMC}. Are you even surprised? Is this the most absurd thing you've seen in Undermountain? Or is this just a normal day for you?": "即使没有头，你也知道这是什么：一个按照哈拉斯特形象打造的铁巨人。一个{@creature Mecha-Halaster|WDMMC}。你甚至感到惊讶吗？这是你在安德山见过的最荒谬的事情吗？还是对你来说只是一个平常的日子？",
	"When {@creature Emberosa|WDMM} hears the doors open, she shouts in {@language Giant|PHB}, \"I told you the inspection was not to be disturbed!\" Roll initiative; the party has a chance to hide before she turns around. If discovered, she attacks them on sight, shouting \"Halaster warned us that you might swing by!\"": "当{@creature Emberosa|WDMM}听到门打开时，她用{@language Giant|PHB}大声喊道：“我告诉过你们不要打扰检查！” 摇骰子决定先攻顺序；队伍有机会在她转身之前藏起来。如果被发现，她会立即攻击他们，大声喊道：“哈拉斯特警告过我们，你们可能会过来！”",
	"This chamber is one massive timekeeper: wizard statues point towards an iron disk suspended above the chamber. A symbol of the sun decorates its underside, and by its hinges you can tell that it is meant to spin in its place.": "这个房间是一个巨大的计时器：巫师雕像指向悬挂在房间上方的铁盘。太阳的符号装饰着它的底部，从它的铰链可以看出它是打算在原地旋转的。",
	"By when the adventurers reach this place, it is daytime on the surface. The Timekeeper reflects this; the symbol of the sun hangs above the chamber.": "当冒险者们到达这个地方时，地表已经是白天了。时间守护者反映了这一点；太阳的符号悬挂在房间上方。",
	"The key found here was moved from A7, its original placement. When the chamber is scrutinized under a spell of {@spell detect magic|PHB}, conjuration magic can be sensed here, as well as the evocation and transmutation already described in WDMM. Halaster has squirreled away the key so as to force characters into defying the Timekeeper, triggering its lightning when a character manually flips the disc to show the moon (representing night). Afterwards, the mithral key is conjured from a pocket dimension and clatters at the center of the chamber. Halaster is quite the sadist indeed.": "这里找到的钥匙已经从原本的A7位置移动了。当在一个{@spell detect magic|PHB}法术的检视下，可以感知到传送魔法，以及WDMM中已经描述的附魔和变形魔法。哈拉斯特将钥匙藏起来，以迫使角色违抗时间守护者，当一个角色手动翻转盘面展示月亮（代表夜晚）时，触发其闪电。之后，秘银钥匙从一个口袋维度被召唤出来，在房间中央发出咔哒声。哈拉斯特确实是一个虐待狂。",
	"This key was originally found in Area 27, but Vanar Freth has since taken it. He's unaware of its purpose but knows it's mithral—and that alone makes it valuable. He's been trying the key on every lock he's since come across, but to no avail. Vanar will only part with the key to save his life, or if convinced of the WMD's countdown (which, given that the alarm is only heard by the adventurers, requires a successful {@dc 22} Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check).": "这把钥匙最初是在第27区发现的，但范纳尔·弗雷斯（Vanar Freth）后来拿走了它。他不知道它的用途，但知道它是秘银制成的—这一点就使它有价值。他一直在尝试用这把钥匙打开他遇到的每一把锁，但都没有成功。范纳尔只会在为了自己的生命或者被WMD倒计时的倒计时说服时才会放弃这把钥匙（考虑到只有冒险者听到警报，这需要成功的{@dc 22} 魅力 ({@skill Persuasion}) 检定）。",
	"Vanar's first instinct upon encountering the party is to flee this room under a spell of {@spell invisibility}. He takes the door to A30 (leaping over the {@spell polymorph} trap, which he's already spotted) and unlocks the {@creature carrion ogre|WDMM} in that chamber using the {@spell mage hand} cantrip and his own deft fingers. Afterwards, he makes for A31—and loops back to A29.": "Vanar在遇到队伍时的第一反应是在一个{@spell invisibility}的咒语下逃离这个房间。他走向A30的门（跳过他已经发现的{@spell polymorph}陷阱），用{@spell mage hand}的cantrip和他灵巧的手指打开了那个房间的{@creature carrion ogre|WDMM}。之后，他前往A31—然后绕回A29。",
	"This rigamarole continues until he's cornered. He isn't above shouting for the {@creature hobgoblin|MM|hobgoblins} in A32, if he can make it that far. Otherwise, he tries to escape via A14, taking the junction south to A3—only to find that, like the party, he too is sealed in Arcturiadoom. Throughout this entire Benny Hill-esque chase, his {@creature shadow demon|MM} accosts the party.": "这种折腾一直持续到他被逼入绝境。如果他能走到那里，他会毫不犹豫地大声呼喊在A32中的{@creature hobgoblin|MM|hobgoblins}。否则，他会试图通过A14逃跑，沿着南边的交叉口到A3——只是发现，就像派对一样，他也被困在阿克图里亚厄的厄运中。在这整个类似本尼·希尔(Benny Hill)追逐的过程中，他的{@creature shadow demon|MM}一直在骚扰着派对。",
	"Other tricks at his disposal are spells of {@spell misty step}, {@spell web|PHB} and {@spell Evard's black tentacles|PHB}, which he uses to tie up the party while he makes a coward's run.": "他还掌握着{@spell misty step}、{@spell web|PHB}和{@spell Evard's black tentacles|PHB}等法术，他会利用这些法术来束缚队伍，以便在懦夫般地逃跑时获得时间。",
	"Vanar is a trickster by heart, an absolute squirrel of an elf. He's clever and prone to half-baked plans that somehow work out in the end. When cornered, he runs his mouth until he spots another opportunity to escape.": "Vanar是一个以欺诈为本性的人，一个绝对像松鼠一样的精灵。他很聪明，倾向于一些勉强凑合的计划，但最终总能奇迹般地成功。当被逼入绝境时，他会滔滔不绝直到发现另一个逃跑的机会。",
	"Vanar is aware of the legends concerning {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} and has since discovered the {@creature Fire Giant|MM|fire giants'} project, which he has correctly guessed will be used in some zany plot to conquer the surface just for the sake of it. Additionally, Vanar speaks {@language Giant|PHB}—and has listened to {@creature Emberosa|WDMM|Emberosa's} grumbling; he knows that Halaster promised them an ancient rune vital to upending the Ordning and the world. He's unconcerned.": "Vanar知晓关于{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}的传说，并且最近发现了{@creature Fire Giant|MM|fire giants'}计划，他猜测这个计划将被用于某种疯狂的阴谋来征服地表，仅仅出于兴趣。此外，Vanar会说{@language Giant|PHB}，并且听说了{@creature Emberosa|WDMM|Emberosa's}的抱怨；他知道Halaster承诺给他们一块古老的符文，对颠覆Ordning和世界至关重要。他并不担心。",
	"It's hideous, this thing—a creature chained to the floor, with the body of an {@creature ogre|MM} and the head of a {@creature carrion crawler|MM}. Mucus and spittle fly as it snarls and struggles in its chains, desperate to have at you. In the corners of this better-left-alone chamber are two corpses: an {@creature ogre|MM|ogre's} head and a {@creature carrion crawler|MM|carrion crawler's} body.": "这个东西太丑陋了——一个被锁在地板上的生物，有着{@creature ogre|MM}的身体和{@creature carrion crawler|MM}的头颅。它咆哮着，挣扎着，口水和鼻涕四溅，拼命想要攻击你。在这个最好别靠近的房间角落里，有两具尸体：一个{@creature ogre|MM|ogre's}的头颅和一个{@creature carrion crawler|MM|carrion crawler's}的身体。",
	"When chased by the party from Area 29, Vanar Freth flees here and looses the {@creature ogre|MM} from its chains using his own deft fingers and a {@spell mage hand} cantrip.": "在被来自第29区的队伍追赶时，瓦纳尔·弗雷斯逃到这里，并用他灵巧的手指和一个{@spell mage hand}的戏法解开了链条上的{@creature ogre|MM}。",
	"You can weather a guess at what sort of creature made this place into a home. The walls are decorated with sculpted tentacles capped with skulls. At the foot of a slime pool cloaked in reeking miasma sits a simpleton in a loincloth too busy sucking his thumb to notice you.": "你可以猜测一下是什么样的生物把这个地方变成了家园。墙壁上装饰着雕刻的触手，顶端镶着头骨。在一池散发着恶臭雾气的粘液池边，一个只穿着腰布的傻瓜正忙着吮吸他的拇指，完全没有注意到你。",
	"If the {@spell feeblemind} spell is reversed, Ellix can inform the party of the whereabouts of three mithral keys. Only a spell of {@spell greater restoration}, {@spell heal|PHB} or {@spell wish} can end the spell.": "如果{@spell feeblemind}咒语被逆转，Ellix可以告知队伍三把秘银钥匙的下落。只有{@spell greater restoration}、{@spell heal|PHB}或{@spell wish}的咒语才能结束这个咒语。",
	"If chased by the adventurers, Vanar Freth loops back to Area 29 by way of this area.": "如果被冒险者追赶，瓦纳尔·弗雷斯会通过这个区域回到29区。",
	"With the WMD armed, Doomcrown is nothing more than a distraction and red herring. If the adventurers happen across this area, they overhear Doomcrown complain to Ernie, the {@creature flumph|MM}, \"I'm not giving up the bloody key\" in {@language Common|PHB} (or {@creature Goblin|MM}, if the party is versed in it; the point is to get them to chase after this red herring). Expect them to bust in, demanding the key and wasting precious time. The \"key\" he refers to is the one to the storeroom, Area 20, where there's apparently wine and ale galore. His captains have been hounding Doomcrown to expand the \"booze ration\" for the sake of morale.": "拥有大规模杀伤性武器后，毁灭王冠不过是一个干扰和误导。如果冒险者碰巧来到这个区域，他们会听到毁灭王冠向{@creature flumph|MM}厄尼抱怨：“我不会放弃那该死的钥匙”，用{@language Common|PHB}（或{@creature Goblin|MM}，如果队伍熟悉的话；目的是让他们追逐这个干扰）。预计他们会闯进来，要求那把钥匙，浪费宝贵的时间。他所指的“钥匙”是通往储藏室，区域20的钥匙，那里显然有大量的葡萄酒和麦酒。他的船长们一直在纠缠毁灭王冠扩大“酒精配给”，以提高士气。",
	"Once the party enter the chamber, read:": "当派对进入房间时，读取：",
	"It's like a kid with building blocks has been on a caverns kick. Seven-foot-tall stalagmite-shaped spires of blocks decorate this chamber. You've caught a {@creature hobgoblin|MM} in the act: he's busy on the seventh spire when you bust in; he's decorated with stained medals and wears his armor as if it were a second skin. Beside him floats a strange jellyfish-like creature whose flesh shifts from blue to bloody orange at your presence. All of you freeze, as if this was an intimate moment better left alone. The hell's going on here?": "就像一个玩积木的孩子沉迷于洞穴。这个洞穴装饰着七英尺高的钟乳石形状的尖塔积木。你抓住了一个{@creature hobgoblin|MM}正在行动：当你闯入时，他正忙着在第七座尖塔上装饰; 他身上挂满了染色勋章，穿着盔甲仿佛是第二层皮肤。在他身旁漂浮着一个奇怪的类似水母的生物，它的肉在你的出现下从蓝色变成血红色。所有人都僵住了，仿佛这是一个最好不被打扰的亲密时刻。到底发生了什么？",
	"No friendship is more precious than a boy and his {@creature flumph|MM|flumph's}.": "没有什么友谊比一个男孩和他的{@creature flumph|MM|flumph's}更珍贵。",
	"The {@creature hobgoblin warlord|MM|Warlord} is a brute at heart with a gentleman's flair for the dramatic and the tactical wit of a military genius. He has no idea what the mithral keys are but has happened across the WMD's chamber before—although he has no idea what its purpose is. \"Magic,\" Doomcrown's fond of saying, \"is better left to greybeards and shamans.\"": "{@creature hobgoblin warlord|MM|Warlord} 本质上是一个粗暴的人，但却有着绅士般的戏剧性和军事天才般的战术智慧。他不知道什么是秘银钥匙，但之前偶然发现过WMD的密室——尽管他不知道它的用途是什么。“魔法，”末日王喜欢说，“最好还是留给长者和萨满们。”",
	"Doomcrown is hopelessly evil, despite Ernie's best efforts to convert him. He'd rather fight the party and die in glorious combat than risk dying as a mewling cur kept in chains. If he shouts loud enough, he can alert the {@creature hobgoblin captain|MM|hobgoblin captains} in Area 32C, who rush to investigate the disturbance.": "末日王冠(Doomcrown)是邪恶至极的，尽管厄尼(Ernie)竭尽全力想要改变他。他宁愿与队伍战斗并在光荣的战斗中死去，也不愿冒着作为被囚禁的懦弱之狗而死的风险。如果他大声喊叫，他可以引起区域32C中{@creature hobgoblin captain|MM|hobgoblin captains}的注意，他们会赶来调查这场骚动。",
	"The {@creature flumph|MM} has no name except the one given to it by Doomcrown: Ernie, after his cousin who died from drinking still water, a story Doomcrown has shared and that Ernie now shares with others. As a {@creature flumph|MM}, its mood is reflected in the color of its membranes. Ernie is particularly sensitive to the moods of nearby creatures; thus, when it sees the party, it turns dark orange to reflect their immense stress.": "这个{@creature flumph|MM}除了末日皇冠赋予的名字外没有其他名字：厄尼，取自他的表弟，他因喝了静水而死，这是末日皇冠分享过的一个故事，现在厄尼也与他人分享。作为一个{@creature flumph|MM}，它的情绪体现在膜的颜色上。厄尼对附近生物的情绪特别敏感；因此，当它看到队伍时，会变成深橙色以反映他们巨大的压力。",
	"Ernie is also hopelessly nihilistic, despite yearning to return home. If informed of the WMD, Ernie does not despair, but instead revels in its impending death. Ernie does not, however, oppose the party in their goal to shut off the WMD. It knows not where any of the mithral keys lie. It can be coaxed to join the party if they promise it safety—\"Why not?\" says Ernie, telepathically, \"We are all doomed to dust one day.\"": "厄尼（Ernie）同样深陷虚无主义，尽管渴望回家。如果被告知有大规模杀伤性武器（WMD），厄尼并不绝望，反而沉浸在它即将到来的死亡中。然而，厄尼并不反对队伍关闭WMD的目标。它不知道任何秘银钥匙的下落。如果队伍承诺给予它安全，它可以被说服加入队伍——“为什么不呢？”厄尼以心灵感应说，“我们终究都注定会归于尘土。”",
	"Plates line the walls of this domed chamber—shining with the unmistakable sheen of mithral. Seven narrow alcoves bite into the walls, just wide enough to squeeze into.": "墙壁上挂满了盘子——闪闪发光，带着明显的秘银光泽。七个狭窄的壁龛咬入墙壁，刚好宽到可以挤进去。",
	"If you're worried that your party will just hide in the alcoves here, you can change it that the six mithral keys unlock the chamber and the WMD is controlled instead by a big, red button and other mechanisms. Obviously, you'll have to contrive this barrier before they get into the chamber.": "如果你担心你的队伍只会躲在这里的壁龛里，你可以改变这样的设定：六把秘银钥匙解锁密室，而大规模杀伤性武器(WMD)则由一个大红色按钮和其他机制控制。显然，在他们进入密室之前，你需要设计这个障碍。",
	"With the WMD armed, a {@spell magic mouth} spell counts down in {@creature Arcturia|WDMM|Arcturia's} reedy voice. The room is also lit in scarlet while the WMD is armed, not the yellow light of the crystal dome.": "当WMD武装起来时，一个{@spell magic mouth}法术在{@creature Arcturia|WDMM|Arcturia's}沙哑的声音中倒计时。房间也被猩红色照亮，而不是水晶圆顶的黄光。",

	"The opulence at display here is fit for kings. Lavishly furnished, this boudoir sports wall-to-wall carpeting, gold silk cushions, and black basalt braziers that smolder with melting incense. Two hammocks are strung between chiseled pillars, and in one naps an Adonis of a man wearing nothing but a golden silk skirt and fine sandals. Track marks march up and down his forearms.": "这里展示的奢华适合国王。这个卧室装饰豪华，墙到墙铺着地毯，金色丝绸靠垫，黑色玄武岩火盆里燃烧着融化的香。两个吊床悬挂在雕刻的柱子之间，其中一个躺着一个只穿着金色丝绸裙子和精美凉鞋的阿多尼斯。他的前臂上有一串串的痕迹。",
	"Alussiarr is in the throes of a dream that's about to end. If you'd like to strike a comical tone, he's pawing at an invisible ball of yarn.

	"The fiend is cunning and presents itself as the ultimate paramour, a peerless lover. Its accent is thick and intriguing, but fake. It takes great advantage over its innate {@spell disguise self} spell and, if its true nature is discovered, promises it can be whatever a potential \"suitor\" wants. The fiend is a hedonist of the deepest debaucheries.": "这个恶魔很狡猾，它表现得像是无与伦比的情人，一个无与伦比的爱人。它的口音浓重而迷人，但是虚伪的。它充分利用自己内在的{@spell disguise self}法术，如果它真实的本性被发现，它承诺可以成为潜在“追求者”想要的任何样子。这个恶魔是一个深陷淫乱的享乐主义者。",
	"Alussiarr only hides behind its mortal façade until it knows that such a disguise can serve it no more. At first, before it drops it, it claims that it is kept as {@creature Arcturia|WDMM|Arcturia's} slave and that any \"right and moral man\" would set it free by breaking the seal of binding that keeps it here. If this argument doesn't work, it drops all pretense and lets the party guess at its otherworldly nature. It promises secrets, loot, and \"the key to prevent your demise.\" As the party learns, the fiend is aware of the armed WMD—but it does not need to worry, for its Limited Spell Immunity trait will protect it from the blast.": "Alussiarr（Alussiarr）只是隐藏在它的凡人伪装背后，直到它知道这样的伪装再也无法为它服务。一开始，在它放弃伪装之前，它声称自己被囚禁为{@creature Arcturia|WDMM|Arcturia's}奴隶，任何“正直和道德的人”都会通过打破囚禁它在此的封印来释放它。如果这个论点不起作用，它会放下所有伪装，让冒险者猜测它的异世本质。它承诺揭示秘密、战利品和“防止你灭亡的钥匙”。当冒险者了解到，这个恶魔知道武器贮备管理局（Armed WMD）的存在——但它不需要担心，因为它的有限法术免疫（Limited Spell Immunity）特性将保护它免受爆炸的影响。",

	"A sudden shock surges through the man, illuminating a form hiding beneath that flesh: a tiger-like humanoid with backward palms. The creature looses a sharp scream and sucks in a heavy breath. \"Fine, mage! Fine!\" he shouts, before turning to you. \"It is true that I intend to work all manner of evil in the city above. Plots, schemes, tomfoolery and vengeance. Stiffing waiters and taxis and the like.\" His lips curl into a smile. \"Now, how about breaking that seal?\"": "一股突如其来的震撼冲击着这个男人，照亮了那层肉体下隐藏的形态：一个类似老虎的人形生物，手掌朝后。生物发出尖锐的尖叫声，深吸一口气。“好吧，法师！好吧！”他大喊一声，然后转向你。“我确实打算在地上的城市里做各种邪恶勾当。阴谋、计划、愚蠢行为和复仇。不付小费给侍者和出租车司机之类的。”他的嘴角勾起一丝微笑。“那么，现在怎么破解那个封印呢？(D&D)\"",

They assume their true forms and attack the party if they move to undo the seal of binding outside Area 39A.": "释放Alussiarr也有可能会引起39B区域的龙（在{@i Companion}）的注意，他们的任务是守护这里的{@creature rakshasa|MM}。当他们听到对话时，他们会闯入并要求邪恶生物保持沉默。如果团队试图在39A区域外解除封印，他们会变成真实形态并对团队发动攻击。",

	"If two characters enter the chamber unmenacingly, the couple swaps partners, sweeping up a character in their waltz. They do not take \"no\" for an answer and introduce themselves. The dancers might ask the adventurers who they are and their purpose here, unaware that the WMD is armed.": "如果两个角色毫无敌意地进入房间，这对夫妇会交换搭档，将一个角色卷入他们的华尔兹中。他们不会接受“不”作为答案，并介绍自己。舞者们可能会问冒险者们是谁以及他们在这里的目的，不知道这个(`WMD`)已经被武装起来。",
	"The drakes play the part of vapid nobles on vacation.

Nay, the fans demand blood, they demand entertainment, and so Halaster expects the party to best Netherskull, who was previously an optional boss. To facilitate this, a sealed, magical door separates Levels 15 and 16, which can only be opened by the bone keys that were previously found in Areas 19 and 30B. Now the keys are carried by Netherskull or left in Area 39C. With this change, the doors to Netherskull's lair must be open when the party has experienced enough of the Obstacle Course. This discretion is left to you and facilitated by Halaster. If the party reaches Area 39C too early, you can have the doors locked, if you so wish.": "{@i Companion}在这个层次上只做了一个真正的改变：对于哈拉斯特或观众来说，派对仅仅到达第37区并进入通往第16层的隧道是不够的。不，粉丝们要求血腥，他们要求娱乐，因此哈拉斯特期望派对能战胜尼德斯库尔，他之前是一个可选的boss。为了实现这一点，15层和16层之间有一扇封闭的魔法门，只能用先前在19区和30B区找到的骨头钥匙打开。现在这些钥匙由尼德斯库尔携带，或者留在39C区。有了这个改变，当派对经历了足够的障碍课程时，尼德斯库尔的巢穴的门必须打开。这个决定留给你，由哈拉斯特协助。如果派对太早到达39C区，你可以选择将门锁上，如果你愿意的话。",

Even if the party hasn't met the githzerai, he can still pluck at the heart strings through a vision showing Ezria being tortured by githyanki.": "在符合当地语言习惯的同时，Halaster提醒队伍关于Ezria。即使队伍还没有遇到这位githzerai，他仍然可以通过一场幻象来触动他们的同情心，展示Ezria正在被githyanki折磨。",

	"Playing on their greed or lust for power, Halaster informs them of the {@item manual of gainful exercise} and {@item tome of clear thought} possessed by {@creature Al'chaia|WDMM}, the githyanki commander.

If your version of the Mad Mage can break the fourth wall, then he even says \"Intelligence score\" and \"Strength score.\"": "在满足他们的贪婪或对权力的欲望时，哈拉斯特告诉他们关于吉斯战士指挥官{@creature Al'chaia|WDMM}拥有的{@item manual of gainful exercise}和{@item tome of clear thought}。他会直截了当地告诉他们这些魔法物品可以增强一个人的力量和智力。如果你的疯狂法师版本可以打破第四道墙，那么他甚至会说“智力值”和“力量值”。",
	"The {@i Companion} likes to relate characters to real pop-culture. To that end, it is suggested that you think of the gith in the lens of Star Wars. If the githzerai are jedi, then the githyanki are best described as the sith. Theirs is a militant, Machiavellian culture hellbent on avenging their ancestors by eradicating illithids—and anyone else in their path.": "{@i Companion} 喜欢将角色与真实流行文化联系起来。为此，建议您将吉思视为星球大战中的角色。如果吉思贼人是绝地武士，那么吉思炎魔就最好描述为西斯。他们是一个好战、权谋的文化，决心通过消灭食脑者和任何挡路的人来为祖先复仇。",

	"The second phase of combat pits the party against the drake on the surface of the asteroid. This can happen naturally if the adventurers are in Area 12 or 20, but it can be forced through a twisted use of the {@spell passwall} spell: she opens up a hole right beneath the party, who falls towards the asteroid's gravity plane and are then shunted to the opposite side. Alternatively, if most of the party fails against her Frightful Presence, cue a harmless montage in which the party tramples across the asteroid's surface in utter and abject fear.": "战斗的第二阶段将队伍置于小行星表面与龙兽对抗。如果冒险者们在区域12或20，这可能会自然发生，但也可以通过对{@spell passwall}法术的扭曲使用来强制发生：她在队伍正下方开了一个洞，队伍掉落到小行星的引力平面上，然后被推到对面。另外，如果大部分队伍未能抵抗她的恐怖气场，那么就会出现一个无害的蒙太奇，展示队伍在极度恐惧中跋涉穿越小行星表面。",
	"Regardless of how it's conceived, {@creature Ashtyrranthor|WDMM} comes clambering across the surface from afar. Out here, she can attack without the worry of harming the githyanki.

They can be shattered easily, and the adventurers can drop down into any area of your choosing. If the party is on the bottom half of the asteroid, these windows propel them upwards into an area of your choosing. Area 23 is the best destination, as it puts the party close to the portal back to Stardock. Once {@creature Ashtyrranthor|WDMM} sees what the party is trying to do, she intercepts. If they escape, she chases after them with a {@spell gaseous form} spell.": "星舰坞 (Stardock) 里不仅仅是石头；偶尔会有窗户，是前一批小行星租户制造的。它们很容易被打碎，冒险者可以掉落到您选择的任何区域。如果队伍在小行星的下半部分，这些窗户会将他们推向您选择的区域。第 23 区是最佳目的地，因为它让队伍靠近返回星舰坞的传送门。一旦 {@creature Ashtyrranthor|WDMM} 看到队伍的意图，她会介入。如果他们逃脱，她会用 {@spell gaseous form} 法术追赶他们。",

Your mind conjures up many a dream: a mountain of gold or a race through the skies—or a kingdom turned to ash by that red leviathan. Greed, wonder, and dread mix together into a sour concoction that leaves you uneasy.": "仿佛你会被假蛋愚弄一样——天真！感到温暖且有点得意，你环顾四周这个隐藏的孵化场。在熔岩池中，有一颗独自一只的带着红斑点的蛋。你的脑海中浮现出许多梦想：一座金山，或者穿越天空的比赛，又或者被那只红色巨兽化为灰烬的王国。贪婪、惊奇和恐惧混合在一起，形成一种让你感到不安的苦涩混合物。",
	"At last you come to the dragons' hoard. Your insides feel as if they're lined with grease. You cannot help but remember the tales of old, of the riches paid tribute to the great leviathans of ancient days. That much is here, piled up without care. Red scales litter the hall and in them sparkle the sheen shed by the piled gold.": "最终，你来到了龙的宝藏。你的内心感觉就像被油脂包裹着一样。你不禁想起古老的传说，那些向古代巨龙致敬的财富。这里堆积着大量的财富，毫不在意地堆放着。红色的鳞片散落在大厅里，在它们之间闪烁着被堆积金币反射出的光泽。",
	"Twin statues watch over this hoard, carved in a likeness you've never seen or heard of in tome or tale. They lack all familiar frills and horns iconic to the world's known dragons.": "这个宝藏上方有一对双生雕像，雕刻成一种你从未在任何典籍或传说中见过或听说过的样子。它们缺乏世界已知龙类常见的所有熟悉的花纹和标志性的角。",

	"Scatter piles of treasure throughout the room; if the dragons are awoken, roll initiative. This gives party members the chance to hide behind treasure mounds.

Thus, they start this level already inside Alterdeep and their progression through the level is inverted, as they must break out of the {@creature mind flayer|MM|mind flayers'} compound after emerging from the simulation.": "这一章节假设你正在进行前一章节中包含的任务：哈拉斯特在派对从星码回来时让他们入睡，并将他们交给了埃克斯特里顿的控制。因此，他们从Alterdeep内部开始这一层的探索，他们的进度是倒置的，因为他们必须在从模拟中脱身后逃离{@creature mind flayer|MM|mind flayers'}的围墙。",

	"If you're running the {@i Companion's} game show element, this is but another episode of Dungeon of the Mad Mage—and now that the entire Multiverse can see and appreciate Extremiton's genius, the {@creature ulitharid|VGM|ulitharid's} fragile ego has swollen to an unfathomable girth.": "如果你正在运行{@i Companion's}游戏节目元素，这只是《疯狂法师之迷宫》的又一集——现在整个多元宇宙都能看到并欣赏到艾克斯特里米顿的天才，{@creature ulitharid|VGM|ulitharid's}脆弱的自尊心已经膨胀到难以想象的程度。",

	"Running Alterdeep is a challenge; not only do you need to deceive your players while also dropping hints that they're in a simulation, you must also run an \"in-town\" episode. Extremiton has no real end-goal for the adventurers, no grand plot besides keeping them in the simulation for as long as it can. Thus, run this simulation in vignettes: let the party trample across Waterdeep, resolving plotlines, taking care of personal errands, and hitting up shops. Seed into this laid-back session vignettes (see below) that can hint at the truth.": "在运行《深渊变动》时是一项挑战；你不仅需要欺骗玩家，同时也要暗示他们处于模拟中，还必须运行一个“城镇”剧集。Extremiton对冒险者没有真正的最终目标，除了尽可能长时间地让他们留在模拟中，没有宏伟的情节。因此，以小插曲的形式来运行这个模拟：让队伍穿越沃特德普，解决情节线，处理个人事务，并逛商店。在这个轻松的场景中，播种一些小插曲（见下文），可以暗示真相。",
	"If your party also ran {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}, you can throw in characters from that campaign that the party has a relation with.

	"As described in Area 14, there are nine other victims to Extremiton's game. You need only concern yourself with a handful of them. Some are detailed in the vignettes below. The party should run into a few of these characters, who understand that something's just not right about Waterdeep.": "正如第14区所描述的那样，有另外九名受害者被卷入了Extremiton的游戏。你只需要关注其中的一小部分。以下是一些受害者的详细信息。队伍应该会遇到其中一些角色，他们意识到瓦特德普发生了一些不对劲的事情。",
	"Extremiton is absolutely fascinated by mortals. Sure, they're cattle to be fed upon, but aren't they so cute? Aren't they hilarious? While its Alterdeep simulation has the benefit of priming the people of Waterdeep for enslavement, the true purpose is that Extremiton just wants to pal around with regular humans and elves, to see for itself how they think and work, to understand their maudlin emotions. Alterdeep is its playground to fulfill the fantasies it's had since it was a tadpole.": "Extremiton（艾克斯特雷米顿）对凡人非常着迷。当然，它们只是被当作食物的牲口，但它们不是很可爱吗？它们不是很滑稽吗？虽然它的Alterdeep（奥特迪普）模拟有助于让水深之都的人民为奴役做好准备，但真正的目的是，Extremiton（艾克斯特雷米顿）只是想和普通人类和精灵一起玩耍，亲自了解他们的思维方式和工作方式，理解他们的伤感情绪。Alterdeep（奥特迪普）是它实现自己从蝌蚪时代起就一直梦想的地方。",
	"Extremiton's foremost goal, other than its and the colony's survival, is the Alterdeep experiment. No matter how juicy its new test subjects are, the experiment comes first, even at the cost of their lives and sanity. Knowing they are hardier than its usual cattle, Extremiton uses them as test dummies for more of its wilder experiments. It's also curious to test an illithid invasion to see how mighty adventurers like themselves will act amidst the carnage: if they'll flee, run, how they might best the {@creature mind flayer|MM|mind flayers'} and their thralls, and so on.": "Extremiton（艾克斯特里米顿）的首要目标，除了自身和殖民地的生存之外，是Alterdeep（奥特深渊）实验。无论其新的测试对象有多么吸引人，实验始终排在第一位，即使以牺牲他们的生命和理智为代价。知道它们比通常的牲畜更坚韧，Extremiton（艾克斯特里米顿）将它们用作更多疯狂实验的试验品。它还很好奇测试一次恶心的侵略，看看像他们这样的强大冒险者在混乱中会如何行动：他们会逃跑、逃走，如何最好地对付{@creature mind flayer|MM|mind flayers'}及其奴隶等等。",
	"Extremiton's simulation isn't perfect. As described in WDMM, if confronted with a flaw, the {@creature ulitharid|VGM} tries to correct it or draw attention away from it. The following list represents several of Alterdeep's flaws, which you can present to the party:": "Extremiton的模拟并非完美。正如《WDMM》中所描述的那样，如果遇到缺陷，{@creature ulitharid|VGM} 会尝试纠正它或转移注意力。以下列表代表了Alterdeep的几个缺陷，您可以向小队展示：",
	"Extremiton speaks {@language Common|PHB}, but not {@language Dwarvish|PHB}, {@language Elvish|PHB}, or {@language Infernal|PHB}. The party find few dwarves, elves, or tieflings in the city.

	"Errors—\"bugs\" as Extremiton calls them, though its fellow illithids know not why—sometimes creep up in simulated characters. These bugged individuals may repeat the same lines, walk into walls or other obstacles, or appear catatonic. If you'd like to strike a comedic tone, actual insects appear when these errors occur (e.g., malfunctioning simulated characters become fixated on a nearby beetle).": "错误——“臂端”称之为“臂虫”，尽管其同类鲎人不知其所以然——有时会在模拟角色中出现。这些出现错误的个体可能会重复相同的台词，走进墙壁或其他障碍物，或者出现痴呆状态。如果你想要营造滑稽的氛围，当这些错误发生时，实际上会出现昆虫（例如，故障的模拟角色会被附近的甲虫吸引）。",
	"Every so often, the {@creature neothelid|VGM} in Area 8 rages enough against its prison to send tremors throughout the caverns, loosening stalactites hanging over the underground river. When they fall, they smash into the dynamo's walls, slowing the water flow. This can cause a brief power outage before the illithids psionically destroy or remove the obstruction. During an out-age, Alterdeep slows down; its sky darkens and details out-side any subjects' immediate notice freeze (e.g., birds freeze in mid-flight until a subject looks at them). This outage does not wake any subjects. Nervous, Extremiton follows up with the subjects as various characters, brushing off the event with phrases like, \"The weather's crazy these days!\" or \"City of Splendors, eh? More like City of Inconvenience!\" or \"Magic, am I right?\"": "每隔一段时间，区域8中的{@creature neothelid|VGM}会足够愤怒地反抗其监禁，从而在洞穴中引发震动，使悬挂在地下河上方的钟乳石松动。当它们掉落时，会砸向发电机的墙壁，减慢水流。这可能导致短暂的停电，直到邪恶食脑者通过精神力量摧毁或移除障碍物。在停电期间，奥特深渐渐减缓；天空变暗，超出任何主体直接注意范围的细节会冻结（例如，鸟儿在半空中冻结，直到有主体看向它们）。这种停电不会唤醒任何主体。紧张的艾克斯特里米顿会跟进主体，扮演各种角色，用诸如“这些天天气疯狂啊！”或“辉煌之城，嗯？更像是不便之城！”或“魔法，对吧？”等短语来淡化事件。",
	"While running Alterdeep, you need to drop subtle hints that things aren't as they seem. However, going into detail will blow the whole ruse. Instead, drop some of these unassuming lines into your narrations:": "在进行《深域变动》时，你需要透露一些微妙的线索，暗示事情并非表面看起来那样。然而，详细说明会破坏整个诡计。相反，可以在叙述中插入一些不起眼的台词：",
	"\"The weather has grown warm as of late,\" if the campaign is set during the colder months. Likewise, replace with \"cool\" if the current season is summer.": "如果战役设定在寒冷的月份，“最近天气变暖了。”。同样，如果当前季节是夏天，替换为“凉爽”。",
	"While the party's navigating the streets or headed to a shop, \"You take a familiar street, but as you make the bend, you notice that little bakery you fancied has closed down and been replaced with a cobbler's shop.\"": "当队伍在街上行进或前往商店时，“你走过一条熟悉的街道，但当你转弯时，你注意到你喜欢的那家小面包店已经关闭，取而代之的是一家皮匠店。”",
	"\"The wind is mighty curious today: you can hear it blowing through the streets, blowing straight past you, but you don't feel it against your skin, nor does it rifle any banners, flags, or tent flaps.\"": "\"今天风很奇怪：你可以听到它穿过街道吹过，直接掠过你，但你却感觉不到它触及你的皮肤，也不会吹动任何旗帜、国旗或帐篷帘。\"",
	"If the party's suspicion is aroused after they interact with a familiar character that seems off, Extremiton panics and tries to paint that character as a {@creature doppelganger|MM}, instead of risking the entire simulation from being blown. Unfortunately, after the second \"{@creature doppelganger|MM},\" it's easy for an adventurer to see through this flimsy ruse.": "如果队伍与一个看起来有问题的熟悉角色互动后引起了怀疑，艾克斯特雷米顿会惊慌失措，并试图把那个角色描绘成一个{@creature doppelganger|MM}，而不是冒着整个模拟被揭穿的风险。不幸的是，在第二个“{@creature doppelganger|MM}”之后，冒险者很容易看穿这个脆弱的伪装。",
	"The adventurers start in the Yawning Portal, vomited out from the eponymous pit that drops Undermountain. Read:": "冒险者们从打开地下城的同名深坑中被呕吐出来，开始在打开地下城（Yawning Portal）中启程。阅读：",

A glass slips from someone's hand, shattering on the floor. A game master running Krakens and Coves in the corner pauses his sweeping oratory. All eyes are upon you—until {@creature Durnan|WDH}, that familiar face, shouts, \"It's just a bunch of adventurers gettin' spit outta Undermountain. Big whoop! Come off it!\"": "当你从那座使打哈欠之门得名的沉塔中被呕吐出来时，整个世界仿佛在咆哮。你倒在地板上，震惊了所有的客人。有人手中的玻璃杯滑落，摔碎在地板上。一个在角落里运行着《(%Krakens and Coves)》的游戏主持人停下了他慷慨激昂的讲述。所有的目光都投向了你——直到{@creature Durnan|WDH}，那个熟悉的面孔，大声喊道：“这只是一群冒险者从安德玛之下被吐出来而已。有什么了不起的！别大惊小怪！”",
	"With that, the tavern resumes its busy cacophony. The Mad Mage's voice whispers into your minds, \"Enjoy your time on the surface. I've, uh, teleportation networks to fix. I'll be back for you shortly, dearest contestants!\"": "随着这句话，酒馆恢复了繁忙的喧嚣声。疯狂法师的声音在你们的脑海中低语道：“享受你们在地表的时光吧。我有一些传送网络要修理。很快我会回来找你们，亲爱的参赛者们！”",

	"The sky's the limit for Alterdeep; give the party as much time as they wish to dawdle, mingle, and run amok. While Extremiton plays as {@creature Durnan|WDH}, the adventurers could play cards with other characters or update any of their past quest givers. If the party goes looking for a new quest for Undermountain, they find that all their usual suspects have to offer are rumors to chase throughout Waterdeep, not the dungeon.": "Alterdeep的可能性无限; 给予队伍尽情消磨时间，交际，尽情放肆。当Extremiton扮演{@creature Durnan|WDH}时，冒险者可以与其他角色玩牌或更新他们过去的任务委托者。如果队伍寻找Undermountain的新任务，他们会发现所有他们通常的线索只是在Waterdeep周围追逐的谣言，而不是地下城。",
	"Remind the party that the City of Splendors is a city of laws, not men. Even such mighty adventurers are expected to obey the law—and in Waterdeep, self-defense is not a valid defense in a court of law for violence or murder. Extremiton, for its part, cares not whether the party escapes the long-arm of the law, but will send the City Watch after them nonetheless. These forces consist of {@creature veteran|MM|veterans} and even {@creature mage|MM|mages} if need be, all created by the simulation. If you've ever wanted to see your party become wanted fugitives but not have to worry about cleaning up the legal fallout later, now's your chance.": "提醒队伍，辉煌之城是一个以法律为准绳的城市，而不是人。即使是如此强大的冒险者也应遵守法律——在瓦特德普，自卫不是在法庭上对暴力或谋杀的有效辩护。至于艾克斯特里米顿，它并不在乎队伍是否逃脱法律的长臂，但仍会派遣城市守卫追捕他们。这些力量包括{@creature veteran|MM|veterans}，甚至{@creature mage|MM|mages}如果需要的话，都是由模拟程序创建的。如果你曾想让你的队伍成为通缉犯，但又不必担心后续的法律问题，那么现在就是机会了。",
	"After leaving the Yawning Portal, ask the party what they want to do now that they've found some \"downtime\" on the surface.

They seek out the adventurers, taking on a variety of disguises to evade Extremiton's scrutiny, who can't sense them and initially writes them off as bugs in the system. The adventurers themselves might grow suspicious, for the githzerai run into the party multiple times but abort their plan, for they can feel Extremiton turning its attention from other subjects in the simulation back to them. Thus, the party might take note of these strange characters.": "一群吉斯赛人，可能由15级的Yrlakka领导，远程渗透模拟环境以释放被囚禁者并结束Extremiton的游戏。通过精心操纵他们自己的思维，这四名{@creature githzerai zerth|MM|githzerai zerths}可以在Alterdeep中潜行而不被察觉。他们寻找冒险者，变换各种伪装以躲避Extremiton的审查，后者无法察觉到他们，并最初将他们视为系统中的错误。冒险者们可能会产生怀疑，因为吉斯赛人多次与队伍相遇，但又中止了他们的计划，因为他们能感觉到Extremiton将注意力从模拟环境中的其他主体转回他们身上。因此，队伍可能会注意到这些奇怪的角色。",

	"Unfortunately, the adventurers' newfound awareness ripples throughout Alterdeep, raising Extremiton's suspicion. Within the next 10 minutes, Extremiton returns from unclouding the {@creature githzerai zerth|MM|zerths'} psychic feedback.

As described above, the cult's plot must be learned by the party by now, so as to add weight to their decision to thwart the cult now or let them be.": "如果冒险者逃离这个地方，付出代价的将不是他们，而是Waterdeep（翡翠之都）—具体来说是{@deity Selûne|Faerûnian|SCAG}和{@deity Lathander|Faerûnian|SCAG|Lathander's}最虔诚的寺庙。如上所述，该邪教的阴谋现在必须被队伍了解，以便为他们决定是现在阻止邪教还是让它们继续发展增加分量。",
	"As you gaze across the ruined chamber, a vision slips its way into your brain, rooting itself behind your eyes.": "当你凝视着这个废墟般的房间时，一个幻象悄然进入你的脑海，扎根在你眼前。",
	"When you blink, the chamber is pristine, glorious. Not yet has that proud throne been reduced to rubble—and slumped within it is a skeletal lord with crimson pinpricks that burn in his empty eye sockets.": "当你眨眼时，房间是一尘不染的，辉煌的。那座骄傲的王座尚未被摧毁，而在里面瘫坐着一个骷髅领主，他空洞的眼眶中闪烁着燃烧的深红色针孔。",
	"\"Is this it?\" the skeletal lord ponders. \"Is this to be my legacy? The legacy of the 'great' Vanrak Moonstar?

	"With that, the vision slips away from you.": "随着这句话，你的视野渐渐模糊了。",
	"Out from the choking mists loom iron hooks set into the walls. Once decorated with portraits, they lie barren, forgotten, red with rust and neglect. Hanging from a hook is a golden war horn encrusted with rubies and sapphires.": "从令人窒息的雾气中，铁钩凸显在墙上。曾经装饰着肖像，如今荒废、被遗忘，生锈斑斑，被忽视。悬挂在一个钩子上的是一只镶嵌着红宝石和蓝宝石的金色战号。",
	"As your eyes make out that gilded horn, your mind reels back with a vision of the past. Gone are you from this cramped chamber and instead in a great hall buttressed by six columns. Stone-hewn steps climb to a dais whose far wall is flanked with marble black statues, one carved in the likeness of a cloaked woman wielding a dagger—and the other in the visage of the Mad Mage himself.": "当你的眼睛看到那个镀金的号角时，你的思绪随之回到过去。你离开了这个狭窄的房间，转而置身于一个由六根柱子支撑的大厅中。石雕的台阶通向一个高台，远墙两侧是用大理石雕成的黑色雕像，一个是一个披着斗篷、手持匕首的女人的雕像，另一个是疯狂法师本人的面容。",
	"The two statues glare at one another as if they were mortal enemies. You look about, noticing that your immense body is scaled and clawed. A hollow voice calls out from the dark, \"Give these fools the death they deserve, {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}!\"": "两尊雕像互相怒视，仿佛它们是死敌。你四处张望，注意到你巨大的身躯覆盖着鳞片，手爪锋利。一个空洞的声音从黑暗中传来，“给这些愚蠢的家伙他们应得的死亡，{@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}！”",
	"You look out: bound to each column is a blindfolded prisoner, six in all, all weeping, all whimpering before their doom. Sucking in a breath, you unleash a blast of shadow that swallows the nearest prisoner—a dwarf. As his body withers away, a {@creature shadow|MM} rises from his corpse, bowing to the dark. With that bow comes the present, delivering you from the wretched past.": "你朝前看去：每根柱子上都绑着一个被蒙住眼睛的囚犯，总共六个，他们全都在哭泣，在厄运降临之前呜咽。你吸了口气，释放出一股吞噬最近的囚犯——一个矮人的阴影冲击。当他的身体消逝时，一个{@creature shadow|MM}从他的尸体中升起，向黑暗鞠躬。随着那个鞠躬，现在的时刻来临，将你从那可怕的过去中解救出来。",
	"The character that experiences this vision can make a {@dc 17} Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check to identify the cloaked statue as a depiction of {@deity Shar|Faerûnian|SCAG}. The party may wonder what sort of beef the Mad Mage apparently has with the goddess.": "这个角色可以进行一次{@dc 17}智力检定，来识别披着斗篷的雕像是{@deity Shar|Faerûnian|SCAG}的一个描绘。队伍可能会想知道疯狂法师似乎与女神有什么矛盾。",
	"Beyond that shadowed curtain lies a gloomy hall decorated with the bones of the dead and gone. As you step over the threshold, a wave pushes past your body as if you just now dove into a black sea. The world drains away, colorless and forlorn, as dark and foreboding as the depths of the lightless earth.": "在那阴影幕后，是一间用死者的骨头装饰的阴暗大厅。当你跨过门槛时，一股浪潮掠过你的身体，仿佛你刚刚潜入黑暗的海洋。世界消失了，无色而凄凉，像无光的大地深处一样黑暗而不祥。",
	"Make no mistake: you've gone from your world to another, this one empty and wanting. A world without light, without warmth, and certainly without hope. It is hollow—and so too are you, as if your very being has been cheapened by crossing this planar threshold—as if there is a part of you you'll never get back. You know it deep in your bones this merciless truth: things will never be the same again.": "毫无疑问：你已经从你的世界来到了另一个世界，这个世界是空荡荡的，渴望着什么。一个没有光明、没有温暖，当然也没有希望的世界。它是空洞的——而你也是如此，仿佛你的存在被穿越这个位面门槛而贬低了，仿佛有一部分的你永远无法找回。你深深地知道这残酷的真相：事情再也不会一样了。",
	"When a character experiences the vision of the past, read:": "当一个角色经历了过去的幻象时，请阅读：",

	"The warrior stumbles to his feet and reaches for a bladeless hilt. With an arcane word whispered from his lips, a blade of pure sunlight bursts forward. \"Remember this, drake? Your gift to me? Challenge me again, and I'll carve out that big heart of yours and eat it!\"": "战士蹒跚站起身来，伸手抓住一个没有刀刃的柄。他从嘴唇轻声低语一道奥术咒语，一把纯净阳光之刃迸发而出。“龙啊，还记得这个吗？你送给我的礼物？再来挑战我，我会削下你那颗大心脏并吞下它！”",
	"Your body twists and enlarges, becoming draconic in nature. Your perspective elevates as you look down at Vanrak, your comrade, your brother. \"Vanrak!\" you cry again. \"I'm your friend! Listen to me—listen! She's using the pain of your father's death to lead you down the darkest of all paths! For the love of {@deity Selûne|Faerûnian|SCAG}, turn away from {@deity Shar|Faerûnian|SCAG|Shar}!\"": "你的身体扭曲并变大，变得像龙一样。你的视角升高，俯视着范拉克，你的同伴，你的兄弟。“范拉克！”你再次呼喊。“我是你的朋友！听我说—听我说！她正在利用你父亲死亡的痛苦引导你走上最黑暗的道路！为了{@deity Selûne|Faerûnian|SCAG}的爱，请远离{@deity Shar|Faerûnian|SCAG|Shar}！”",

	"With an uttered arcane word, sunlight springs forth from the sword's hilt, shedding its golden light across the chamber. The knight, you now see, is a corpse. His face is but bone and his eyes burn with a fire that sheds no light. Likewise, you now see your own form: draconic claws peel at the stone floor; your scales are the color of pregnant shadows.": "随着一个咒语的低语，阳光从剑柄中迸发，将金色的光芒洒向房间。骑士，你现在看到，已经是一具尸体。他的脸上只剩下骨头，眼睛中燃烧着一团不发光的火焰。同样地，你现在看到了自己的形态：龙爪在石板地面上划过；你的鳞片是孕育着阴影的颜色。",

	"The Caverns of Ooze are already absurd, but it's time to dial that up to eleven. Since the genies already sing, we might as well play some... copyrighted songs throughout the level.

His smile is just as greasy and he beams it at you like torchlight.": "当你周围充满胜利的气氛，并且魂器已交给你的恩人时，哈拉斯特(Halaster)的形象从墙壁中走出，就像一扇门。他的手油腻，头发也是；用一种难闻的油脂梳理得整整齐齐。他的微笑也同样油腻，像火炬般照射在你身上。",

No longer...\"": "\"干得好，干得好，干得好！\"哈拉斯特大声喊道，他的声音在洞穴中回荡。图像因静电而摇摆不定。“我亲爱的参赛者，我的朋友，我的明星。{@creature Ezzat|WDMM|Ezzat'll}永远也无法忘怀。事实上，他再也无法活下去了！”哈拉斯特仰头大笑，兴奋地拍打着自己的膝盖。“他再也不会困扰我的思绪！我再也不会因曾经的记忆和可能的未来而哭泣！我再也不需要记得我如此深爱和珍惜的兄弟。再也不会了……\"",
	"The image of Halaster rapidly begins to fade, first losing all color, then definition. \"No longer... must I feel human. No longer must I feel at all...\" The image sobers, giving you a blank look. His eyes go wide with the realization of it all. The Mad Mage blinks—once, twice—and by the third time, he's gone to lament the loss of one he loved so well.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）的形象迅速开始消失，先是失去了所有的颜色，然后失去了轮廓。“我不再需要感受人类。我不再需要任何感觉……”图像变得严肃起来，给你一个空洞的眼神。他的眼睛因为意识到一切而瞪大了。疯狂法师眨了眨眼睛——一次，两次——到第三次，他已经消失了，悲叹着失去了他深爱的人。",

	"Act I starts when the adventurers are first brought to Area 23, where they meet {@creature Fazrian|WDMM}. The {@creature planetar|MM} is already aware of the party's crimes, having been told by Halaster, whose letter is on the arm of {@creature Fazrian|WDMM|Fazrian's} throne. This brief part consists of {@creature Fazrian|WDMM} charging the party and laying down the rules of the trial.

	"With that, {@creature Fazrian|WDMM} grants the adventurers their leave, graciously allowing them to take up Area 10 as their temporary residence. However, before they leave, he has each of them swear the following oath, using his Divine Awareness trait to determine whether they will defy his rule: \"I swear to remain here in the Deep Mines until the trial's conclusion; I swear to respect the verdict rendered unto us by the jury and to accept the sentence meted out, should guilt be found.\"": "随后，{@creature Fazrian|WDMM} 慷慨地允许冒险者们离开，并允许他们将区域10作为他们的临时住所。然而，在他们离开之前，他让每个人发誓以下誓言，利用他的神圣感知特性来确定他们是否会违抗他的规则：“我发誓要留在深矿中直到审判结束；我发誓要尊重陪审团对我们作出的裁决，并接受判决结果，如果被判有罪的话。”",
	"{@creature Fazrian|WDMM} focuses on which clause a character lies about. Even if they lie, he still wishes to go through the farce of a trial before executing them.": "{@creature Fazrian|WDMM} 关注的是角色撒谎的内容。即使他们撒谎，他仍然希望在执行之前经过一场审判的闹剧。",
	"After being dismissed, the party must compile a list of witnesses (preferably five) that they can count on to provide favorable testimony, and deliver that list to {@creature Fazrian|WDMM} directly or indirectly via a minion. Remind your players that you yourself will be roleplaying these NPCs, so they must give you notice. Not calling witnesses all but dooms their defense. Also remind them that they are representing themselves, whereas, apparently, a prosecutor has been appointed.": "被解雇后，该队必须编制一个可以信赖的证人名单（最好是五个），并将该名单直接或间接通过手下交给{@creature Fazrian|WDMM}。提醒你的玩家，你将会扮演这些NPC，因此他们必须提前通知你。不传唤证人几乎注定了他们的辩护失败。同时提醒他们，他们是在自我辩护，而显然，已经任命了一个检察官。",
	"If the party is at full strength, they can likely prevail over {@creature Fazrian|WDMM}. He knows this; the Mad Mage knows this; and they, of course, suspect it. If you cannot afford for the party to achieve a long rest, have Halaster drop a {@creature beholder zombie|MM} on them whenever they try to finish one.": "如果队伍人手齐整，他们很可能能战胜{@creature Fazrian|WDMM}。他知道这一点；疯狂法师知道这一点；当然，他们也怀疑这一点。如果你无法让队伍获得长休息，可以让哈拉斯特在他们试图完成长休息时投下一个{@creature beholder zombie|MM}。",
	"Act II begins the next day with an unannounced visit by the {@creature nycaloth|MM}, Raxxus, who escorts the party to Area 23. When they arrive, {@creature Fazrian|WDMM} is not yet there, but the jurors and prosecution are. As described in Area 23B, the prosecution stands before the crystal menhirs; the jurors (and witnesses) share the north wall. Meanwhile, the defense must stand with their backs against the open pit, just beyond the reach of the {@creature otyugh|MM|otyughs} lairing there.": "第二幕的第二天，{@creature nycaloth|MM} Raxxus 未经通知地造访，护送着队伍前往23区。当他们到达时，{@creature Fazrian|WDMM} 还未到场，但陪审团和控方已经在场。正如23B区所描述的，控方站在水晶巨石前；陪审团（和证人）则在北墙。与此同时，辩方必须背靠着开放的深坑站立，就在那里{@creature otyugh|MM|otyughs}潜伏着。",
	"Generally, the party is barred from speaking to the jury; Raxxus moves in if they try, insisting (with his axe drawn) that they take their places near the pit.": "通常情况下，团队被禁止与陪审团交谈；如果他们尝试这样做，Raxxus（手持斧头）会出现，并坚持让他们站在坑边。",
	"The {@i Companion} assumes the party is already familiar with {@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim}, having met him on L12. Adjust accordingly if you never included him or he died.

It's you guys! What are you doing here?\"": "你朝着控方望去——竟然是哈拉斯特本人。{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}！他竟然在一个他肯定自己策划的审判中起诉你！愤怒之火在你的血液中燃烧，你冲了过去，但当那位法师转身时，你听到的却是{@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim}，{@spell simulacrum}的喵喵声音：“哦，嘿！是你们啊！你们在这里干什么？”",
	"It takes {@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim}, who's a bit daft, to remember that it's the party that he's prosecuting this time. He explains that, after untangling himself from House Freth, he found his way to the Terminus Level. Since he is not truly alive, {@creature Fazrian|WDMM} could not judge him (\"He just about short-circuited,\" {@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim} says) and thus decided to hire him for a \"greater purpose.\" Initially, that was to counsel and represent defendants, but after proving himself to be a little too green, {@creature Fazrian|WDMM} relegated him to prosecution instead.": "这位有点傻的{@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim}记得这次是他在起诉这个团队。他解释说，在与弗雷斯伯爵家脱离纠缠后，他找到了终点层。由于他并非真正活着，{@creature Fazrian|WDMM} 无法判决他（\"他差点短路了，\" {@creature Halaster's simulacrum|WDMMC|Sim} 说），因此决定雇佣他为一个\"更伟大的目的\"。最初是为了辩护和代表被告，但在证明自己太过幼稚后，{@creature Fazrian|WDMM} 将他降级到了起诉工作。",
	"When the trial is about to commence, {@creature Fazrian|WDMM} enters the chamber (from Area 24, if you don't mind betraying the location of the secret door; in which case he was cradling the headless corpse of the cleric Brythia, believing it will keep him \"true\" and \"just\").

	"Tailor the proceeding dialogue to your party. If they have a group name use it. Otherwise, {@creature Fazrian|WDMM} calls on their true and full names.

	"The trial is divided into three \"rounds\" interrupted by recesses. Both the prosecution and defense can call a recess which can last 10 minutes to an hour.

	"The prosecution calls the first witness; the defendants, of course, have a chance to cross-examine that character. The defense can then call their witness.

	"Whenever a party objects to how the opposition questions a witness, they must succeed on an Intelligence ({@skill History}) check to convince {@creature Fazrian|WDMM} to sustain or overrule this behavior.

	"Without the last card of his {@item Three-Dragon Ante Set|PHB|Three-Dragon Ante} firmly in his pocket, Malgorn is swayed solely by logic.

	"Heartless, {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} is swayed only by logic. He cares not for the morality of one's actions, only if they were justified legally or naturally.

	"As you turn the head around, you can't help but think that she was pretty in life. Not so much in death. As you lift your eyes from hers—already half-eaten by maggots—you see that the blood stains on the far wall depict a giant hand... the symbol of {@deity Torm|Faerûnian|SCAG}, God of Courage and Self-Sacrifice.": "当你转过头去时，你不禁觉得她生前很漂亮。但在死后就不那么美了。当你从她那已经被蛆虫啃食了一半的眼睛上抬起目光时，你看到远处墙上的血迹描绘出一个巨大的手……那是{@deity Torm|Faerûnian|SCAG}，勇气与自我牺牲之神的象征。",
	"What a farce.": "真是一场闹剧。",
	"They've done it, the madmen. The adventurers have reached 17th level, triumphing over nearly all of Undermountain's troubles. Only one level remains between them and the Mad Mage.

With a mind of their own, they can attack a creature within 10 feet of them ({@hit 6} to hit). On a hit, the creature is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 14}) and takes {@damage 1d6} psychic damage. The tentacle nest has 16 hit points and an AC of 14. Inside each nest is a cloudy eye that leaks a milky-white fluid.": "正如《哈拉斯特的游戏》所描述的那样，与遥远位面的接触已经在地下山脉的许多地方，尤其是暗影黄昏要塞，生长出了触手。这些触手有着自己的意识，它们可以攻击距离它们10英尺以内的生物（攻击加值{@hit 6}）。命中后，生物被{@condition grappled}（摆脱{@dc 14}）并受到{@damage 1d6}点精神伤害。触手巢穴有16点生命值和14点护甲等级。在每个巢穴内都有一个混浊的眼睛，流出乳白色的液体。",

	"The energies of the Far Realm are wreaking havoc on the physics of Shadowdusk Hold. At any moment, an area or character—but not an aberration—can suffer from one of the following effects:": "远域的能量正在对暗影黄昏要塞的物理产生破坏。在任何时刻，一个区域或角色——但不包括畸变生物——可能会受到以下效果之一的影响：",
	"Gravity no longer affects creatures equally in Shadowdusk Hold, subjecting some to the effects of a {@spell reverse gravity} spell. At your discretion, a creature must roll a {@dice d20}. On a result of 1–11, gravity remains normal for the creature. On a roll of 12–15, gravity vertically reverses; on a result of 16–19, it shifts 90 degrees so that they fall towards the east.

	"Under this variant, the Shadowdusks have stabilized their portal to the Far Realm and an inaugural class of star spawn—horrors featured in Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes—have stormed the sanctum, slaughtering anyone not of Shadowdusk blood.

	"The creatures of Shadowdusk Hold must seek out the adventurers, charging them down as they're detected.

Give no quarter, no respite.": "Shadowdusk Hold的生物必须寻找冒险者，一旦发现他们就会向他们发起冲锋。将责任从队伍身上转移——而不是逐个调查房间并遇到敌人，敌人必须主动找到他们，这样才能营造出Dead Hold的氛围。不留情面，不给喘息之机。",
	"As noted several times below, in the sixth encounter of Dead Hold, one mortal must be given (or give themselves) to the Far Realm to host a {@creature star spawn seer|MTF}.

	"Most aberrations on this level, including the {@creature nothic|MM|nothics} and slaadi, have been cosmetically changed to star spawn.": "这一层的大多数异常生物，包括{@creature nothic|MM|nothics}和斯拉迪，都被改变成了星界孵化物。",

	"As noted in WDMM, star spawn periodically visit Shadowdusk Hold. These horrors are described in Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes and are featured in the Dead Hold variant. Do not be deceived by their listed CR's: star spawn are deadly.

	"Even the lowly {@creature Star Spawn Grue|MTF|grues} can doom a party, as they impose disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws on non-aberrations within 20 feet—without a saving throw to resist that aura. {@creature star spawn grue|MTF|Grues} are pitiful by themselves but become a deadly nuisance when mixed with other creatures.": "即使是卑微的{@creature Star Spawn Grue|MTF|grues}也能使一个队伍受到厄运，因为它们会对20英尺内的非畸变生物造成攻击和豁免扑克牌的劣势——而没有豁免来抵抗那个光环。{@creature star spawn grue|MTF|Grues}单独时很可怜，但当与其他生物混合时就会变成致命的麻烦。",
	"The {@creature Star Spawn mangler|MTF|mangler} is rated as a CR 5 monster—and that could not be further from the truth. This horror can make up to six attacks in a single turn, with advantage against a target that has yet to act in the first turn of combat—and with its {@skillCheck stealth 7} bonus to {@skill Stealth} checks, it's more than likely to {@quickref surprised|PHB|3|0|surprise} someone in the party. Were the {@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler} to make all six attacks against one target, it would deal an average of 48 slashing damage and 42 psychic damage—and a critical hit isn't unlikely. Ask yourself how much health your party's wizard or sorcerer has before you merrily unleash the {@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler} upon them.": "这只怪物被评定为CR 5——而事实上相去甚远。这个恐怖存在可以在一个回合内进行多达六次攻击，对于在战斗的第一个回合还未行动的目标有优势——加上它在{@skill Stealth}检定上的{@skillCheck stealth 7}加值，很可能会{@quickref surprised|PHB|3|0|surprise}队伍中的某人。如果这只{@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler}对一个目标进行了所有六次攻击，平均会造成48点割伤伤害和42点精神伤害——而且暴击并非不可能。在轻松释放这只{@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler}对他们的时候，请先考虑一下你的队伍中的巫师或术士有多少生命值。",
	"The {@creature Star Spawn Hulk|MTF|hulk} is both an aberrant bruiser and tank. If it strikes the same target with both Slam attacks, it can {@condition stunned|PHB|stun} them—a condition that is deadly at all levels of this game. Because of their Psychic Mirror trait, other star spawn, namely the {@creature star spawn seer|MTF|seer}, will target them with psychic damage so that it bounces off and harms the {@creature star spawn hulk|MTF|hulk's} foes. Do not forget that even if two {@creature star spawn hulk|MTF|hulks} are within 10 feet of each other, they cannot create an endless feedback loop of psychic damage. The triggering psychic damage bounces off the {@creature star spawn hulk|MTF|hulk} only once; the other {@creature star spawn hulk|MTF|hulk} is simply immune to the damage.": "{@creature Star Spawn Hulk|MTF|hulk}既是异常的破坏者又是坦克。如果它用两次猛击攻击同一目标，它可以{@condition stunned|PHB|stun}他们——这种状态在游戏的所有级别中都是致命的。由于它们的心灵镜特性，其他星体产物，即{@creature star spawn seer|MTF|seer}，会以心灵伤害攻击它们，然后反弹并伤害{@creature star spawn hulk|MTF|hulk's}的敌人。不要忘记，即使两个{@creature star spawn hulk|MTF|hulks}在彼此之间距离不到10英尺，它们也不能制造无尽的心灵伤害反馈循环。触发的心灵伤害只会反弹一次；另一个{@creature star spawn hulk|MTF|hulk}只是免疫这种伤害。",
	"The {@creature Star Spawn Seer|MTF|seer} is our penultimate villain in Dead Hold. It can only be formed by a foul union between a mortal and sentient energy from the Far Realm. One of the Shadowdusk {@creature Archmage|MM|archmagi} must be sacrificed for this purpose (preferably Melissara or Cassiok). In combat, the {@creature star spawn seer|MTF|seer} targets its pet {@creature star spawn hulk|MTF|hulks} with the Psychic Orb ability, splashing its foes with psychic damage.": "在《死亡控制》中，{@creature Star Spawn Seer|MTF|seer} 是我们倒数第二个反派。它只能由一个凡人和来自遥远领域的有意识能量的邪恶结合形成。为此，必须牺牲一个影暮{@creature Archmage|MM|archmagi}（最好是梅丽莎拉或卡西奥克）。在战斗中，{@creature star spawn seer|MTF|seer} 会利用其“心灵宝珠”技能瞄准宠物{@creature star spawn hulk|MTF|hulks}，向敌人施加心灵伤害。",
	"The {@creature Star Spawn Larva Mage|MTF|larva mage} comes out to play only if eight hours pass without the party closing the portal to the Far Realm in Area 32. Unfortunately for our heroes, even if they slay the creature, it might later return, per its Return to Worms trait.": "只有在八小时内没有关闭区域32中通往遥远位面的传送门时，{@creature Star Spawn Larva Mage|MTF|larva mage}才会出来玩耍。不幸的是，即使英雄们杀死了这个生物，根据其“返回蠕虫”特性，它也可能会再次出现。",
	"For a mad asylum in frequent contact with the Far Realm, Shadowdusk Hold doesn't have enough star spawn. There are aberrations, sure, but not enough of those mind-rending horrors.

	"Most {@creature nothic|MM|nothics} on this level are now star spawn in name and appearance while retaining their normal statistics.

The {@i Companion} notes which {@creature nothic|MM|nothics} have been turned into star spawn.": "这个级别上大多数{@creature nothic|MM|nothics}现在以名字和外表都变成了星界衍生物，但保留了它们正常的属性。它们各不相同；只能被描述为“多臂恐怖”，它们的触手肢体上长满了带牙齿的锯齿。{@i Companion}记录了哪些{@creature nothic|MM|nothics}已经变成了星界衍生物。",
	"While they are indeed aberrations, slaadi have been seen before the party—and they come from Limbo, not the Far Realm. They are instead reptilian ooze-creatures whose limbs somehow cut sharper than forged steel.": "虽然它们确实是异常存在，但在队伍之前已经见过斯拉迪(slaadi)—它们来自阴府(Limbo)，而不是远境(Far Realm)。它们是爬行的粘液生物，其肢体比锻造的钢铁还要锋利。",
	"{@creature Dezmyr Shadowdusk|WDMM|Dezmyr's} council of {@creature wraith|MM|wraiths} are instead creatures of a sickly light, roughly humanoid in shape—for that is the closest association a mortal mind can make when confronted by these things.": "{@creature Dezmyr Shadowdusk|WDMM|Dezmyr's}议会的{@creature wraith|MM|wraiths}实际上是一种病态光线的生物，大致呈人形——因为这是凡人面对这些事物时能做出的最接近的联想。",
	"Because {@creature Dezmyr Shadowdusk|WDMM|Dezmyr} and {@creature Zalthar Shadowdusk|WDMM|Zalthar} were paladins in life that fell from grace, you need not change them much. Dark powers of any sort can create a {@creature death knight|MM}. Perhaps instead of skeletons clad in armor, they're now faceless creatures in an exoskeleton of chitin—your choice.": "因为{@creature Dezmyr Shadowdusk|WDMM|Dezmyr}和{@creature Zalthar Shadowdusk|WDMM|Zalthar}在生前是堕落的圣武士，你无需改变他们太多。任何形式的黑暗力量都可以创造{@creature death knight|MM}。也许，他们现在不再是穿着盔甲的骷髅，而是无面孔的甲壳生物—由你决定。",
	"Dead Hold is designed to evoke terror and urgency. It is run as a series of encounters aimed at getting the party from Area 1 to Areas 23, 32, 34 and 35, the last of which gets them to Level 23. In an ideal world, the party will free the {@creature couatl|MM} in Area 34, which can close the portal in Area 32 by sacrificing itself. Thereafter, the party can take the arcane gate in Area 35 to Level 23—hopefully sacrificing the Shadowdusks' {@item black crystal tablet|WDMM}, found in Area 23, which began this entire mess in the first place. Under this variant, any magic item sacrificed to gain passage to Level 23 is permanently destroyed.": "《死亡困境》旨在唤起恐惧和紧迫感。它被设计为一系列遭遇，旨在将冒险小队从区域1带到区域23、32、34和35，最后一站将他们带到23级。在理想的情况下，冒险小队将在区域34中解救{@creature couatl|MM}，它可以牺牲自己来关闭区域32的传送门。此后，冒险小队可以通过区域35的奥术之门到达23级，希望能够牺牲在区域23中发现的引发整个混乱的影暮族{@item black crystal tablet|WDMM}。在这种变体下，为了通往23级而牺牲的任何魔法物品都将被永久摧毁。",
	"Dead Hold is not a slow burn. The party is entering Shadowdusk Hold after it's already fallen. They must be confronted with horror at every turn. It's only after that all seems lost that they're given a glimmer of hope in the form of closing the portal to the Far Realm and sparing the world from these aberrant horrors.": "《死亡要塞》不是一个缓慢燃烧的故事。队伍进入(Shadowdusk Hold)已经沦陷的要塞。他们在每一个转角都必须面对恐怖。只有在一切似乎都已经失去希望之后，他们才会看到一线希望——关闭通往(远境)的传送门，拯救世界免受这些畸变恐怖的侵袭。",
	"Because the inclusion of star spawn adds more challenge to an already deadly level (again, there's two {@creature death knight|MM|death knights}, multiple {@creature Archmage|MM|archmagi} and a {@creature adult blue dracolich|MM|dracolich}!), you can remove other creatures from the level to maintain a (relative) balance. These creatures are:": "由于星体的加入给已经致命的层面增加了更多挑战（再次，有两个{@creature death knight|MM|death knights}，多个{@creature Archmage|MM|archmagi}和一个{@creature adult blue dracolich|MM|dracolich}！），你可以移除层面上的其他生物，以保持（相对）平衡。这些生物是：",

	"One of the {@creature Archmage|MM|archmagi}, who must be sacrificed for the {@creature star spawn seer|MTF} to take a mortal form. Preferably, this is Melissara (of A10), who is dragged kicking and screaming to the portal after the party meets her. Otherwise, use Cassiok (Area 39) because, c'mon, the body of a beetle isn't horrific, it's just ridiculous. Alternatively, do both, if Melissara does not end up fighting the party.": "必须献祭{@creature star spawn seer|MTF}以获得凡人形态的{@creature Archmage|MM|archmagi}之一。最好选择Melissara(A10)，当队伍遇到她后，她被拖着尖叫着走向传送门。否则，选择Cassiok(Area 39)，因为嘿，一个甲壳虫的身体并不可怕，只是荒谬可笑。或者，如果Melissara最终没有与队伍对抗，那就两个都用吧。",
	"Three of the six {@creature wraith|MM|wraiths} in A38 to make up for Encounter 6.": "在A38中的六个{@creature wraith|MM|wraiths}中选择三个来完成第6次遭遇。",
	"On this level, more than any, creatures already dwelling in other rooms—such as the many {@creature nothic|MM|nothics} and {@creature grell|MM|grells}, should investigate other sounds, should the party fail to be stealthy. You want doors being kicked down and hordes of horrors to descend upon the party. The first level is relatively quiet, but the second and third are where they come under fire from throngs of monsters.": "在这个层次上，与其他房间已经居住的生物——比如许多{@creature nothic|MM|nothics}和{@creature grell|MM|grells}——应该调查其他声音，如果队伍不够隐秘的话。你希望门被踢开，一群恐怖生物袭击队伍。第一层相对安静，但第二和第三层是他们受到大批怪物攻击的地方。",
	"After the party meets Jeras, the {@creature cultist|MM} added to Area 1, the encounters below—the Dead Run, more or less—begins.": "在聚会遇到杰拉斯之后，{@creature cultist|MM}被添加到区域1，以下的遭遇——死亡奔跑，开始了。",
	"The first encounter of Dead Hold features the {@creature star spawn mangler|MTF}, a terrifying, multi-armed creature. After the party are appraised of the situation by Jeras, they're liable to an ambush by the {@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler}. It begins to hunt them and will attack before they descend to the second level of Shadowdusk Hold. It prefers to attack in Area 3 or 9 (replacing the area's preexisting combatants if need be) after the party returns from an adjacent room. It can also attack in the stairwell if they immediately make for it. When the adventurers return to either of these areas, they find the hallway dark; all sconces have been snuffed—curious, since they were lit with {@spell continual flame} spells.": "在《死亡牢狱》的首次遭遇中，出现了{@creature star spawn mangler|MTF}，一个令人恐惧的、多臂的生物。在杰拉斯向队伍介绍情况后，他们可能会遭到{@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler}的伏击。在他们下到影暮要塞的第二层之前，{@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler}就开始追踪并发动攻击。它更倾向于在3或9区域发动攻击（必要时替换该区域原有的战斗参与者），在队伍从相邻房间返回后进行攻击。如果他们立即朝楼梯跑去，它也可以在楼梯间发动攻击。当冒险者们回到这些区域时，他们会发现走廊变暗了；所有的壁灯都被熄灭了——这很奇怪，因为它们原本是用{@spell continual flame}的法术点亮的。",
	"The {@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler} clings to the ceilings or hangs from the walls, dropping amidst the party when it attacks. It immediately unleashes its Flurry of Claws attack. Don't forget to utilize its {@skillCheck stealth 7} bonus to its {@skill Stealth} checks.": "当{@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler}紧贴天花板或悬挂在墙上时，会在袭击时突然掉落在聚会中。它会立即释放它的爪子连击攻击。不要忘记利用它的{@skillCheck stealth 7}加值来进行{@skill Stealth}检定。",
	"If the {@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler} is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, it takes the {@action Hide} action as a bonus action and flees. It clambers up the walls, its claws puncturing the stone, to avoid {@action opportunity attack||opportunity attacks}. If it can, it goes for the stairwell to Shadowdusk Hold's second level. It can then attack later on.": "如果{@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler}的生命值降至20点或更少，它会将{@action Hide}动作作为奖励动作并逃跑。它攀爬墙壁，爪子刺穿石头，以避开{@action opportunity attack||opportunity attacks}。如果可能的话，它会朝着通往Shadowdusk Hold的第二层的楼梯走去。然后它可以在稍后进行攻击。",
	"When the {@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler} attacks, describe it no more than as a \"a faceless, fleshless, eight-armed horror whose claws are the color of night.\" Don't try to fill in the blanks, but instead let the players' imaginations run wild. To that end, you want the {@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler} to escape, because then it becomes an object of dread to hang over the party, until its inevitable return. If it dies, the party can inspect its corpse and that scrubs away much of its mystery.": "当{@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler}发动攻击时，描述它为“一种无脸、无肉、八臂的恐怖存在，其爪子如夜色一般。”不要试图填补空白，而是让玩家的想象力自由驰骋。为此，你希望{@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler}逃脱，因为这样它就成为了一种悬挂在队伍头顶的恐惧对象，直到它不可避免地再次出现。如果它死了，队伍可以检查它的尸体，这将消除它的许多神秘感。",
	"On the heels of the {@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler's} attack comes a swarm of star spawn: {@dice 2d4 + 3} {@creature star spawn grue|MTF|star spawn grues} and {@dice 1d4 + 1} {@creature nothic|MM|nothics} that boil out of the stairwells in Area 3 or 9. They're chasing after {@dice 1d6 + 2} blubbering {@creature cultist|MM|cultists} that are making a break for the exit.": "在{@creature star spawn mangler|MTF|mangler's}攻击之后，一群星体后裔涌现出来：{@dice 2d4 + 3} {@creature star spawn grue|MTF|star spawn grues} 和 {@dice 1d4 + 1} {@creature nothic|MM|nothics} 从3区或9区的楼梯间涌出。它们正在追赶着{@dice 1d6 + 2}，那些正在朝出口逃跑的{@creature cultist|MM|cultists}。",
	"The {@creature nothic|MM|nothics} involved in this attack are only {@creature nothic|MM|nothics} mechanically. Cosmetically, they're star spawn, not cursed Shadowdusk arcanists. Subtract their numbers from the five {@creature nothic|MM|nothics} found in Area 20B. They're included in this encounter only because {@creature star spawn grue|MTF|grues} lose much of their potential if they're not joined by a non-{@creature star spawn grue|MTF|grue} ally (per their Aura of Madness trait).": "这次袭击中涉及的{@creature nothic|MM|nothics}只有{@creature nothic|MM|nothics}是机械的。在外观上，它们是星体生成物，而不是被诅咒的暗影黄昏秘术师。将它们的数量从区域20B中发现的五个{@creature nothic|MM|nothics}中减去。它们只包含在这次遭遇中，因为如果它们没有非{@creature star spawn grue|MTF|grue}盟友（根据它们的疯狂光环特性），{@creature star spawn grue|MTF|grues}的潜力将大大减弱。",
	"When the star spawn boil out from the depths, the Far Realm's influence poisons the oxygen in Shadowdusk Hold for the next 10 minutes. The party will likely associate this sudden change with the {@creature star spawn grue|MTF|grues}.": "当星体孵化物从深渊中涌出时，遥远位面的影响会在接下来的10分钟里污染影暮要塞的氧气。队伍很可能会将这突然的变化与{@creature star spawn grue|MTF|grues}联系起来。",
	"The third encounter is a social one that threatens to erupt into violence. The adventurers open a door—any door, it doesn't matter, for the Far Realm has warped space just as it has time—onto Area 10A, where they meet Melissara, the {@creature archmage|MM}.": "第三次遭遇是一次社交事件，有可能演变成暴力冲突。冒险者打开一扇门——任何一扇门都可以，因为法尔境域已经扭曲了空间，就像扭曲了时间一样——进入10A区域，他们遇到了梅丽莎拉，{@creature archmage|MM}。",
	"Melissara wants nothing more than to end this madness. The star spawns' recent arrival has shocked her to her core, but she dares not make an escape, believing that an \"eight-armed horror\" is waiting for her to make her move and that \"they\" will allow none of the Shadowdusk family to leave. \"They want their parade,\" Melissara says, \"they crave the welcoming my brethren so promised them.\" She implores them to seal the portal and slay her undead cousins.": "梅丽莎拉(Melissara) 想要的就是结束这场疯狂。星体孵化物的最近到来震惊了她的内心，但她不敢逃跑，相信一个“八臂恐怖”正在等待她采取行动，而“他们”不会让任何Shadowdusk家族的人离开。“他们想要他们的游行，”梅丽莎拉说，“他们渴望着我的同胞们所承诺的欢迎。”她恳求他们封闭传送门并杀死她的不死族表亲。",
	"She also tells them where to find the {@item black crystal tablet|WDMM} that started this entire mess. If they can find a way to destroy it, grand. If they cannot, the best thing they can do for this world, she says, is to take it far away from Shadowdusk Hold so that her brethren can never again use it to contact the Far Realm.": "她还告诉他们在哪里找到了导致整个混乱的{@item black crystal tablet|WDMM}。如果他们能找到摧毁它的方法，那就太好了。如果不能，她说，对这个世界最好的事情就是把它带远离影暮要塞，这样她的同胞们就再也无法利用它来联系遥远的位面。",
	"Melissara will allow the adventurers to rest in her suite, but they must contend with the irritable and overprotective Derrion (her husband, a {@creature champion|VGM}) who refrains from violence only at her request. However, if they do so, the seventh encounter of Dead Hold comes to pass.": "Melissara将允许冒险者在她的套房里休息，但他们必须应付易怒且过度保护的Derrion（她的丈夫，一个{@creature champion|VGM}），他只会在她的要求下才克制住暴力。然而，如果他们这样做，那么《死亡牢狱》的第七次遭遇就会发生。",
	"See Area 10 for further details and Melissara's dialogue for this encounter.": "请查看区域10以获取更多详细信息，并查看此次遭遇的Melissara的对话。",
	"This encounter should occur only on Shadowdusk Hold's second or third levels. When it does is up to you, but it should be done early in their exploration of Level 2.": "这次遭遇应该只发生在暗影黄昏要塞（Shadowdusk Hold）的第二或第三层。它发生的时间由你决定，但应该在他们探索第二层时尽早进行。",
	"By now, Tezca-Zyanya, the {@creature couatl|MM} trapped in the black obelisk of Area 34, has sensed the adventurers. The celestial is aware of the fell energies seeping out from the Far Realm portal in Area 35 and seeks to close it. To do so, Tezca-Zyanya must be freed from the obelisk.": "到目前为止，特兹卡-齐安娅，被困在第34区的黑色方尖碑中的{@creature couatl|MM}，已经察觉到了冒险者们。这位天界生物意识到了从第35区的法域传送门中渗出的邪恶能量，并试图关闭它。为了这样做，特兹卡-齐安娅必须从方尖碑中解救出来。",

	"\"Listen to me,\" whispers a saccharine voice. \"This world, this very reality, is in danger of falling apart. There yawns a portal on the lowest level of this mad asylum, a portal to a realm that should not be. Free me! It is my duty to spare this world from those horrors! Free me by toppling my prison—an obelisk guarded by a {@creature death knight|MM|knight of death}!

	"Tezca-Zyanya's only solution to the Far Realm portal is to enter it itself and close it from the other side. Doing so will subject the celestial to an eternity of torment and madness—a sacrifice it is more than willing to make, if given the chance.

This act of sacrifice should come as a twist later on, so don't reveal this to the party just yet.": "特兹卡-齐安娅（Tezca-Zyanya）对于远境之门的唯一解决方案是亲自进入并从另一侧关闭它。 这样做将使这位天界生物遭受永恒的折磨和疯狂——如果有机会的话，它宁愿做出这种牺牲。 有关此事，请参阅区域34中关于{@creature couatl|MM|couatl's}对话。 这种牺牲行为应该在后来作为一个转折出现，所以暂时不要向队伍透露这一点。",
	"This encounter can occur anywhere on Level 2 or 3, preferably in Areas 20 or 29, such as when the party is leaving Area 23 or about to descend the staircase to Area 30.

Now you don't really know what they are, only that they... breathe.": "你感受到一股风似乎在推动你的整个存在。地板和墙壁之间的线条扭曲了。在一些地方，石头似乎融化了。在其他地方，它们相交的角度让你感到头晕。支撑天花板的柱子，你的眼睛似乎不愿意看？它们曾经只是柱子。现在你真的不知道它们是什么，只知道它们...在呼吸。",

This can occur three times, after which the music box loses its magic.": "如果冒险者们听金色音乐盒的歌曲，歌曲需要{@dice 1d4 + 2} 回合才能播放完，那么在一个芭蕾舞者可能出现的地方，会神奇地出现一颗钻石。这种情况最多发生三次，之后音乐盒就会失去魔力。",
	"The simple fact is that the adventurers are just about to peak. It doesn't matter if they defeat this level's bosses; they're already 17th-level and they're slated to hit 20th-level after they defeat Halaster.": "简单的事实是冒险者们即将达到巅峰。无论他们是否击败了这一级别的boss，他们已经是17级，并且在击败哈拉斯特后将达到20级。",
	"If the adventurers ran through the Dead Hold encounter, give them the experience they would have earned if they tackled the {@creature adult blur dracolich|MM|dracolich}. If the party destroyed the {@item black crystal tablet|WDMM} and sealed the rift, the Shadowdusks' are effectively destroyed, all their efforts undone. Without the tablet, they can't so easily contact the Far Realm. Without the rift, the star spawn cannot waltz into this reality. The party has truly scored a victory for Toril and the Multiverse at large.": "如果冒险者们成功突破了死亡禁闭遭遇，给予他们他们如果应对{@creature adult blur dracolich|MM|dracolich}时会获得的经验。如果队伍摧毁了{@item black crystal tablet|WDMM}并封闭了裂缝，那么影幕家族已经被有效地摧毁，他们的所有努力都化为乌有。没有了那块石碑，他们就不能轻易地联系到远境。没有了裂缝，星界产物也无法轻易进入这个现实。队伍为托瑞尔和整个多元宇宙取得了真正的胜利。",
	"The Dead Hold variant is of so much importance that separate send-offs to end your session are written below. Regardless of which one you use, add in Halaster Bids to the end.": "Dead Hold（死亡握持）变体非常重要，因此下面写了单独的告别语来结束你的游戏。无论你使用哪种，最后都要加上哈拉斯特（Halaster）的祝福。",
	"You have always known Undermountain to be the opposite of paradise—but this, as they say in the worlds above, truly takes the cake. The foul efforts of these freaks can never be told, lest they inspire others to stranger heights. As you stand in the gate to Halaster's personal domain, you can't help but shudder with relief as you put an unknowable amount of distance between you and Shadowdusk Hold. You can only pray that the Mad Mage has a gateway there that will let you return home without ever again stepping foot in this madhouse.": "你一直知道地底山是天堂的反义词，但正如上面的世界所说，这真的是难以置信。这些怪物的恶劣行径无法言说，以免激发他人更疯狂的行为。当你站在哈拉斯特（Halaster）个人领地的大门前时，你不禁感到一阵宽慰，因为你已经将自己与影暮堡（Shadowdusk Hold）隔绝开来，距离难以估量。你只能祈祷那位疯狂法师在那里有一个传送门，让你能够回家，永远不必再踏入这个疯人院。",

	"The world will never know how close it came to destruction—and nor should it. This rift has been sealed, but there are surely others that would try to open that blasphemous door to the Far Realm. They would try, you have no doubt, emboldened by the near success of the Shadowdusks.": "世界永远不会知道它离毁灭有多近——也不应该知道。这个裂缝已经被封闭，但肯定还有其他人会试图打开通往远境的亵渎之门。他们会尝试，你毫无疑问，受到影暮家族差一点成功的鼓舞。",
	"Even you have forgotten so much of what has transpired. Dully, you understand that's just your mind's attempt to cope with the horrors you've witnessed. Like patterns in the sand, waves sent from the deep ocean of your mind wipe away any evidence of what happened. The details are already foggy. Some part of you knows that you ought to remember—but your mind refuses, as if it were a parent choosing the better of two evils. Your sanity has surely been frayed—and soon you won't even know it. Will your mind ever heal? Will it ever surrender to you the memories of what—": "即使你已经忘记了许多发生过的事情。麻木地，你明白这只是你的大脑试图应对你所目睹恐怖的方式。就像沙滩上的图案一样，从你内心深处涌出的波浪擦去了任何发生过的证据。细节已经变得模糊不清。你的某个部分知道你应该记住——但你的大脑拒绝了，就像是一个父母在两害取其轻的选择。你的理智肯定已经受到了影响——很快你甚至都不会意识到。你的大脑会愈合吗？它会向你交出发生过的记忆吗—（D&D）？",

	"You'll return, you tell yourself—but deep in your heart, you know that to be a lie. Perhaps one day you can forgive yourself for such cowardice—even if the world, whether it learns of this blasphemy, does not. Your only solace is that, should you cut down the Mad Mage, you might find in his sanctum the secrets to return to Shadowdusk Hold—and bring about these freaks' well-deserved reckoning.": "你告诉自己，你会回来的—但在你的内心深处，你知道那是个谎言。也许有一天，你能原谅自己的懦弱—即使这个世界，无论是否得知这个亵渎，都不会。你唯一的慰藉是，如果你击败了疯狂法师，你可能会在他的密室中找到返回暗影黄昏要塞的秘密—并给这些怪物应得的惩罚。",

You speed through corridors strewn with passing stars and long-drawn-out light. Halaster's voice bounces off the curve of infinity and resounds in your mind: \"Our game is almost at an end. The stars turn, and a time presents itself.\"": "大门充满能量，将你带离这个疯人院。然而，通往疯狂法师圣所的旅程并非瞬间完成。你穿过布满流星和长长的光线的走廊飞驰而过。哈拉斯特的声音在无限的曲线上回荡，响彻你的脑海：“我们的游戏快要结束了。星星转动，时机已现。”",
	"It's in that moment you realize Halaster has been the patron behind all this madness. If he did not orchestrate the Shadowdusks' efforts, he certainly approved it, gave it his rubber stamp. If he would allow such things to be bidden into this world, then he cannot be left alive. He's broken a covenant with all mortalkind—with the Multiverse itself. No person should be willing to let those things crawl into reality.": "就在那一刻，你意识到哈拉斯特（Halaster）一直是这一切疯狂背后的主使。如果他没有策划影暮家族（Shadowdusks）的行动，那他肯定是默许了，给予了他的认可。如果他允许这些事情降临到这个世界，那么他就不能留在世上。他已经违背了与所有凡人——与整个多元宇宙的契约。没有人应该愿意让那些东西爬进现实中。",
	"This madness must be stopped, and that burden falls to you. Only you are in a position to end {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM|Halaster Blackcloak's} spree.

	"Chasing that is another realization, this one far more chilling: he wants you there. He's expecting you. Perhaps he always has. Perhaps all of this is just one long-drawn-out game of chess in which a deluded pawn has painted itself as the king. He's waiting for you there, armed and ready in a mad wizard's lair.": "追逐这一切是另一个领悟，这一次更加令人不安：他想要你在那里。他在期待着你。也许他一直都在期待。也许这一切只是一场漫长的国际象棋游戏，一个被蒙蔽的卒自诩为国王。他正在那里等着你，手持武器，准备在一个疯狂巫师的巢穴里。",

	"{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} is a mad genius empowered by the legendary Knot in the Weave. He has defied his natural lifespan and spent it in the study of magic.

Suffice to say that the final showdown of this campaign is a letdown unworthy of print.": "{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}是一位被传说中的编织之结赋予力量的疯狂天才。他蔑视自然寿命，将其用于研究魔法。他狡猾、邪恶、偏执，并且是无法真正死去的奥术大师，只要他的死亡发生在安德玛之下。然而，《WDMM》却将他描绘成了一个轻量级角色。可以说，这场冒险的最终对决是一个不值一提的令人失望的结局，不值得印刷。",
	"Here are a number of issues with Halaster, as presented in WDMM.

	"Despite being a CR 23 foe, Halaster is a glass cannon, hardly able to withstand a group of 17th-20th-level adventurers for even a single round.": "尽管是一个CR 23的敌人，哈拉斯特(Halaster)是一个玻璃加农炮，几乎无法抵挡一群17级至20级的冒险者，甚至连一个回合都难以坚持下去。",
	"With the exception of the {@creature empyrean|MM} Nalkara, he has laid no traps for the adventurers—not a {@spell glyph of warding|PHB}, not a spell of {@spell symbol|PHB}.

	"The Mad Mage does not need to fear death—he has returned several times already. However, it takes an excruciating toll on his body and, more importantly, his ego. Halaster wants to have his game, but he does not want to lose. He will not abide failure—because he has never been a failure. He's died, he's goofed up, dropped the ball, and made more mistakes than he can remember, but he is not a failure.": "疯狂法师不需要害怕死亡——他已经多次复活了。然而，这对他的身体和更重要的是他的自尊心造成了极大的伤害。哈拉斯特（Halaster）想要玩他的游戏，但他不想失败。他不会容忍失败——因为他从来没有失败过。他曾经死过，搞砸过，失误过，犯过比他记得还多的错误，但他并不是一个失败者。",
	"That being said, Halaster is in pursuit of something far greater than victory: a challenge. He has had quite a while to prepare for the adventurers and he could easily crush them—he could {@spell wish} them away—but that would not be satisfying. That's what Halaster craves: satisfaction by besting a worthy opponent whose fate is undetermined.

	"When the adventurers take the fight to Halaster, don't excuse stupidity for madness. Halaster is, of course, the Mad Mage, but he is not irrational for this encounter. He is, perhaps, the most lucid he has ever been. He would take every precaution that would not spoil the challenge. He would not spare an enemy—in fact, he would break the fourth wall and subvert expectations by finishing them off. Above all, he cannot afford to become a cliché, and he knows it. There are no grandiose speeches, no taunts.

	"\"I'm the tower of power, too sweet to be sour. I'm funky like a monkey. Sky's the limit and space is the place!\"": "\"我是力量之塔，甜得不能再甜。我像猴子一样时髦。天空是极限，太空是地方！\" (Tower of Power)",
	"\"Best there is... past, present, and future! Oh yeah!\"": "\"无论是过去、现在还是未来，都是最棒的！Oh yeah!\"",
	"\"Expect the unexpected in the kingdom of madness!\"": "\"在疯狂王国里，预料之外的事情屡见不鲜！\"",
	"\"The cream surely rises to the top!\" (Nalkara says this after a Trembling Strike or after standing up from being {@condition prone}. She then just continues to shout, \"The cream of the crop!\")": "“奶油肯定会浮到表面！”（在一次震颤打击之后或从被{@condition prone}击倒后，Nalkara 会说这句话。然后她会继续大喊，“顶尖人才！”）",
	"Nalkara follows these tactics in battle:": "Nalkara 在战斗中遵循以下战术：",
	"As an {@creature empyrean|MM}, Nalkara is incapable of even considering the possibility of failure. She fights without fear, without caution. Egotistical, she fantasizes about glorious one-on-one duels with a formidable warrior—thus, she eliminates the \"softer\" members of the party first, leaving the resident barbarian, fighter, or paladin for last.": "作为{@creature empyrean|MM}，Nalkara甚至无法考虑失败的可能性。她战斗时毫无恐惧，毫不谨慎。自负的她幻想着与一名强大的战士进行辉煌的一对一决斗，因此她首先消灭队伍中“软弱”的成员，最后留下居住的野蛮人，战士或圣骑士。",
	"On her first turn, Nalkara softens up her foes with a {@spell fire storm} spell. At your discretion, the spell instead deals cold damage. Objects set aflame burn under a blue flame.": "在她的第一个回合中，Nalkara用{@spell fire storm}法术削弱她的敌人。酌情而定，该法术改为造成冰冷伤害。被点燃的物体燃烧着蓝色火焰。",
	"Nalkara picks off distant or flying targets with her Bolt attack, choosing cold damage—or surprises them by flying herself.": "Nalkara 用她的闪电攻击来攻击远处或飞行中的目标，选择冰冷伤害，或者通过飞行来给他们一个惊喜。",
	"Nalkara pairs her Legendary Actions to annihilate foes, first using Trembling Strike and then a Maul attack, courtesy of another Legendary Action.": "Nalkara配合她的传奇动作来消灭敌人，首先使用震颤打击，然后是一次猛击攻击，这得益于另一个传奇动作。",
	"If the adventurers triumph over Nalkara, the audience quickly turns on them—incited by the announcers—for felling their beloved champion. The legion fans begin to hurl their garbage and insults at them from afar. Images from {@spell arcane eye} spells are projected onto the sky, showing the party the enraged crowd. An announcer shouts, \"Get 'em!\" and the fans surge forward, slamming their fists against the Thunderdome, which slowly powers off. Just before the first fan—a demon—can get at the party, a rift opens up and sucks the adventurers back to Undermountain, depositing them into Area 33.": "如果冒险者们战胜了纳尔卡拉，观众会迅速对他们产生敌意——被主持人煽动——因为他们击败了他们心爱的冠军。军团的粉丝们开始从远处向他们投掷垃圾和侮辱。来自{@spell arcane eye}法术的影像被投射到天空中，向队伍展示了愤怒的人群。一名主持人大喊道：“抓住他们！” 粉丝们涌向前方，猛击雷鸣之穹顶，它慢慢地关闭了。就在第一个粉丝——一个恶魔——要接近冒险者们之前，一道裂缝打开，将冒险者们带回了安德瞳山，将他们送到了33区。",
	"The final showdown with Halaster is, to say the least, lackluster. It's almost guaranteed the party will want to fight him—him, their tormentor and jailor—yet he prepares nothing. Even though he can be resurrected in Undermountain, death is painful and humiliating. This section provides several encounters you can use to overhaul your showdown.": "与哈拉斯特（Halaster）的最终决战，可以说是乏善可陈。几乎可以肯定，冒险小组会想要与他——他们的折磨者和监禁者——进行战斗，然而他却毫无准备。尽管他可以在安德山（Undermountain）中复活，死亡是痛苦且羞辱的。本节提供了几个遭遇，您可以使用它们来彻底改变您的决战。",
	"Most encounters are meant to be finished in either one round of combat or to halt combat completely. However, failing that, should the Mad Mage lose 100 or more hit points in a phase, he dips out and heads to your next chosen encounter.": "大多数遭遇都应在一轮战斗中结束，或者完全停止战斗。然而，如果未能实现这一点，如果疯狂法师在某个阶段失去100或更多生命值，他会退出并前往您选择的下一个遭遇。",
	"After overcoming two of Halaster's challenges, the party should level up to 19th-level. However, this doesn't entitle them to regaining all their resources (i.e., they do not heal up to their hit points, they only get an extra hit die to increase their hit point maximum, et cetera).": "在克服哈拉斯特(Halaster)的两项挑战后，队伍应该升级到19级。然而，这并不意味着他们可以恢复所有资源（即，他们不会恢复到满血，只是获得额外的一个骰子来增加他们的生命值上限，等等）。",
	"When next you open your eyes, the world has swelled into a great riot of polished wooden lanes lit by crazed lamps. Surely, the Mad Mage has shrunk you with his foul chicanery. On the far wall, in titanic letters, a sign reads, \"Bowl-A-Rama!\" You try to make sense of it, but you find no bowls here. Not on the tables, not on the distant counter. All you see is a gargantuan {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} polishing a ceramic ball as stout and thick as a dwarf. His yellow grin stretches wide and his pores gape like craters. He shouts, \"You're entering a world of pain!\"": "当你再次睁开眼睛时，世界已经膨胀成一片由疯狂灯光照亮的抛光木制小巷的大混乱。毫无疑问，疯狂法师用他邪恶的诡计把你缩小了。在远处的墙上，用巨大的字母写着一个标志，“保龄球乐园！” 你试图理解这一切，但你发现这里没有保龄球。桌子上没有，远处的柜台上也没有。你看到的只有一个巨大的{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}正在擦拭一个像矮人一样结实厚实的陶瓷球。他的黄色笑容拉得很开，他的毛孔像火山口一样张开。他喊道，“你正在进入一个痛苦的世界！”",
	"You reach for your weapons, but your limbs disobey! They disobey! You struggle against your {@condition invisible} bonds to no avail and it's only then that you notice that Halaster has kidnapped innocents from all across Undermountain. All are struggling against their {@condition invisible} bonds, mewling or demanding answers as to what game they've been dragged into, their terror alight.": "你伸手拿起武器，但你的四肢不听使唤！它们不听使唤！你挣扎着想摆脱{@condition invisible}的束缚，但毫无用处。直到此刻，你才注意到哈拉斯特（Halaster）绑架了来自安德山地下城各处的无辜人质。所有人都在奋力挣扎着摆脱{@condition invisible}的束缚，有的哀鸣，有的要求知道他们被卷入了什么游戏，恐惧之情油然而生。",
	"That's when you hear it: the crash of thunder. Halaster has pitched that ceramic ball; as it sails down the lane, it seems to shift, revealing it to be a ball of pure force that reduces the first victim—a barber you recognize from Skullport—into a red smear.": "就在这时，你听到了雷声的轰鸣。哈拉斯特（Halaster）投出了那个陶瓷球；当它飞过球道时，似乎在变形，最终显露出它是一个纯粹的力量球，将第一个受害者——一个你在骷髅港（Skullport）认识的理发师——化为一滩红色的污渍。",
	"\"A world of pain!\" Halaster shouts again.": "“痛苦的世界！”哈拉斯特再次大喊。",
	"Exercising his love of bowling, Halaster condemns his foes to an extradimensional bowling alley where they—and innocent victims—are the pins. His first pitch completely demolishes an innocent.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）发挥他对保龄球的热爱，将他的敌人们和无辜的受害者们都囚禁在一个超维度的保龄球道上，他们就像保龄球瓶一样。他的第一次投球完全摧毁了一个无辜者。",
	"Within this realm, characters other than Halaster remain their normal size. It may seem to them that they have been shrunk to the relative-size of a bowling pin, for the bowling alley is massive, as is Halaster (although, for the purpose of combat, he is still a Medium size creature).": "在这个领域中，除了哈拉斯特(Halaster)之外的角色保持他们正常的大小。对他们来说，他们似乎已经被缩小到相对于保龄球瓶的大小，因为保龄球道是巨大的，哈拉斯特也是如此（尽管在战斗中，他仍然是一个中等体型的生物）。",
	"The lane on which the adventurers and other victims start is a 15-foot-wide, 150-foot-long passage enclosed by {@spell wall of force|PHB|walls of force}. Creatures in it cannot fly via magic items or spells.": "冒险者和其他受害者开始的通道是一个宽15英尺，长150英尺的通道，被{@spell wall of force|PHB|walls of force}封闭。在其中的生物不能通过魔法物品或法术飞行。",
	"There are ten pins in a game of bowling; Halaster has kidnapped enough innocents to fill out that ten, after accounting for the adventurers. Choose characters that the adventurers have an attachment for, otherwise they won't care for their fates.": "在保龄球比赛中有十个瓶；哈拉斯特（Halaster）绑架了足够的无辜人质来填满这十个瓶，考虑到冒险者的数量。选择冒险者有感情依恋的角色，否则他们不会关心这些人的命运。",
	"The pins start the encounter {@condition paralyzed}. At the end of their turn, a pin can attempt a {@dc 15} Charisma saving throw, ending it on a success.": "{@condition paralyzed}中的针脚开始遭遇。在它们的回合结束时，一根针脚可以尝试进行一次{@dc 15}魅力豁免才能，在成功时结束。",
	"Halaster is a sadistic host. It wouldn't be enough for the adventurers to watch their comrades be pulverized by magical bowling balls. Whenever a pin is targeted by Halaster, but before his attack roll is made, a character can use their reaction to swap places on the board, letting them be struck. Thus, to save their friends, the adventurers must put themselves at risk. If a character swaps with a {@condition paralyzed} character, both characters become {@condition paralyzed} and must attempt a {@dc 15} Charisma saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a success.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）是一个虐待狂的主人。冒险者们看着他们的同伴被魔法保龄球粉碎是远远不够的。当哈拉斯特瞄准一个保龄球瓶时，在他进行攻击骰前，一个角色可以使用自己的反应来与棋盘上的位置交换，让自己被击中。因此，为了拯救他们的朋友，冒险者们必须冒险。如果一个角色与一个{@condition paralyzed}角色交换位置，两个角色都会变成{@condition paralyzed}，并且必须在回合结束时尝试进行一次{@dc 15}魅力豁免才能结束效果。",
	"The Mad Mage is a masterful bowler; within this realm, his bowling balls are condensed energy. For this encounter, he cannot attack or cast a spell against creatures on a lane; he can only use his Bowl attack, described below. Once a pin reaches the end of the lane, he can contend with them as normal.": "疯狂法师(The Mad Mage)是一位精湛的保龄球手；在这个领域中，他的保龄球是凝聚的能量。在这次遭遇中，他不能对道路上的生物进行攻击或施法；他只能使用他的保龄球攻击，如下所述。一旦一个瓶子到达道路的尽头，他可以像平常一样与它们竞争。",

	"Halaster makes a Bowl attack against a pin.": "哈拉斯特(Halaster)对一个钉(pin)发动了一次碗(Bowl)攻击。",
	"The Mad Mage bowls from within a {@spell globe of invulnerability}. When Halaster is struck by a ranged weapon attack, a {@spell glyph of warding|PHB} activates, unleashing a {@spell warding wind|XGE} spell that disadvantages ranged weapon attacks that pass in or out of the wind. Halaster's Bowl attacks are unhindered.": "疯狂法师从{@spell globe of invulnerability}内进行保龄球比赛。当哈拉斯特被远程武器攻击击中时，{@spell glyph of warding|PHB}会被激活，释放一个{@spell warding wind|XGE}法术，使通过风向内外传递的远程武器攻击受到不利影响。哈拉斯特的保龄球攻击不受影响。",
	"Halaster continues playing his game until the majority of the adventurers have escaped the lane or when he has lost 50 or more hit points. Afterwards, the characters are expelled from the bowling alley. Proceed to the next encounter.": "哈拉斯特继续玩他的游戏，直到大多数冒险者逃离赛道，或者他失去50点或更多生命值。之后，角色们被驱逐出保龄球馆。继续进行下一个遭遇。",
	"Halaster brings the adventurers to a demiplane that resembles a chessboard—and to their horror, they find familiar faces forced to play in the game. The Mad Mage has kidnapped individuals from across Undermountain and even the world at large.": "哈拉斯特(Halaster)将冒险者们带到一个类似棋盘的半位面，令他们惊恐的是，他们发现熟悉的面孔被迫参与这场游戏。这位疯狂法师绑架了来自安德瑪山(Undermountain)甚至整个世界的个体。",
	"This challenge is a moral one; if the innocents involved are not known by the party, it loses all its impact. You have to include individuals both loved and hated by the party—and distribute them across both teams. As an example, if Vlonwelv Auvryndar survived the party, and they detest her, put her on their team. Meanwhile, someone the party cherishes is on the black team. Would it not be gut-wrenching to order Vlonwelv, their hated enemy, to murder their beloved friend for the sake of the game? If you run out of individuals, snatch familiar faces from the adventurers' lives: a friend, an acquaintance that once loaned them 10 silver, their local baker, or the lonely old painter that spends his time feeding the birds near the church. Hell, grab their barbers, the cobbler that made their shoes, and especially their mothers and mentors. No one is safe from {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}.": "这个挑战是一个道德考验；如果牵涉到的无辜者对冒险者一无所知，那么它就失去了所有的影响力。你必须包括冒险者既爱又恨的个人，并将他们分配到两个队伍中。举个例子，如果Vlonwelv Auvryndar幸存下来，而他们憎恨她，就把她放在他们的队伍里。与此同时，冒险者珍爱的某人在黑队里。难道不会让人心如刀绞，命令他们憎恨的敌人Vlonwelv 杀死他们珍爱的朋友，只为了游戏？如果你用尽了个人，就从冒险者生活中熟悉的面孔中抓取：一个朋友，曾经借给他们10银币的熟人，他们当地的面包师，或者那位在教堂附近喂鸟的孤独老画家。甚至可以抓取他们的理发师，制作他们鞋子的皮匠，尤其是他们的母亲和导师。没有人能逃脱{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}。",
	"Unless a character already has statistics, use the ones befitting their piece in the {@table Chess Piece Statistics|WDMMC} table.

	"The magical game of chess follows these rules, in addition to the normal rules of chess. The party is forced to play the game and can't act as they normally would in combat.": "魔法棋盘游戏遵循以下规则，除了国际象棋的正常规则外。派对成员被迫参与游戏，不能像在战斗中那样行动。",
	"Halaster's team is black, symbolizing the evil nature of this demented game.": "哈拉斯特的队伍是黑色的，象征着这个疯狂游戏的邪恶本质。",

Every character's movement speed is reduced to 0 and they can only move as the piece they represent can.": "在这场遭遇中，没有先攻顺序。白队先行动，然后是黑队。每个回合，一支队伍只能移动一个棋子。角色是{@condition incapacitated}。每个角色的移动速度降低为0，他们只能按照所代表的棋子移动。",
	"Whenever a piece takes another, it instantly kills them unless the defending piece is a player character or Halaster, in which case the player character instantly takes the damage from the attacks used by the attacking piece (e.g., a {@creature knight|MM|knight's} two {@item greatsword|PHB} attacks) and is then eliminated from the game. An eliminated player character is teleported to the side of the board and can no longer affect the game or its pieces. They can, however, affect themselves (i.e., drink a potion).": "每当一枚棋子吃掉另一枚时，除非被吃掉的棋子是玩家角色或哈拉斯特(Halaster)，否则它会立即被消灭。如果被吃掉的是玩家角色，则玩家角色会立即承受攻击棋子所使用的攻击（例如，一个{@creature knight|MM|knight's}两个{@item greatsword|PHB}攻击），然后被从游戏中淘汰。被淘汰的玩家角色会被传送到棋盘的一侧，不再影响游戏或其棋子。但他们可以影响自己（例如，喝下一瓶药水）。",
	"If a piece overtakes another piece and subjects it to a saving throw, such as a spell that only does half damage on a success, the overtaken piece can attempt their saving throw, but is still eliminated. This is so that a piece can't just unleash a {@spell finger of death} on a player character without any chance of halving the damage. Use tact whenever determining which attack the overtaking piece uses; there is indeed such a thing as overkill in this encounter.": "如果一个棋子超过另一个棋子并让其进行豁免投掷，比如一个只有成功才会减半伤害的法术，被超过的棋子可以尝试他们的豁免投掷，但仍然被淘汰。这样一来，一个棋子就不能在没有任何减半伤害的机会下对玩家角色释放{@spell finger of death}。在确定超越棋子使用哪种攻击时要谨慎；在这次遭遇中确实存在过度杀伤的情况。",
	"When the first king is slain, the remaining pieces on their team take 22 ({@damage 4d10}) necrotic damage and the encounter ends. Any player characters already eliminated also take this damage.": "当第一位国王被杀死时，他们队伍中剩余的棋子会受到22({@damage 4d10})点死灵伤害，遭遇结束。任何已被淘汰的玩家角色也会受到这个伤害。",
	"If Halaster is overtaken, he takes damage from his attacker's attack, but doesn't take the {@damage 4d10} necrotic damage for losing. He leaves the demiplane before the damage is inflicted.": "如果哈拉斯特(Halaster)被攻击，他会受到攻击者的伤害，但不会因失败而受到{@damage 4d10}点死灵伤害。他会在伤害生效前离开半位面。",
	"You don't need to attach an identity to every piece on the board, but you do want to bring back individuals that left a lasting mark on the party and survived. Your table will vary, of course, but some possible individuals are included below. Their statistics are not in Appendix B of this chapter.": "你不需要给棋盘上的每个棋子都附上身份，但你确实想要把那些对团队产生深远影响并幸存下来的人带回来。当然，你的团队成员会有所不同，但以下是一些可能的个体。他们的统计数据不在本章的附录B中。",

If the adventurers are responsible for its death, the beast hungers only to revenge itself upon its killers.

	"In this encounter, Halaster takes the adventurers on an absurd tour of the Multiverse. Whenever they arrive to a new plane, the party must grapple with its hazards, denizens, and any planar effects it imposes upon visitors.

	"Once Halaster is finished gallivanting across the planes, or when he's beaten within an inch of his life, he returns them to Area 33. Everyone but Halaster crashes onto the floor and is knocked {@condition prone}. Remember, Halaster can only be reborn if he was slain within Undermountain. Therefore, he ends this planar spree when near death.": "一旦哈拉斯特(Halaster)在各个位面上狂欢完毕，或者被打得奄奄一息，他会将他们送回到33区。除了哈拉斯特之外，所有人都会摔倒在地上，晕厥{@condition prone}。请记住，只有在安德山(Undermountain)内被杀死，哈拉斯特才能重生。因此，当他濒临死亡时，他会结束这场位面之旅。",

Unfortunately, it is bound by a contract to never harm Halaster—but the other three fiends aren't.": "依赖恶魔的贪婪，哈拉斯特将队伍带到了地狱居住地盖亚纳，邪恶的尤戈洛斯之地。律师恶魔，一位名为海尼斯（Hiynis）的{@creature yagnoloth|MTF}，是疯狂法师惯常与之签订地狱契约的经纪人。当海尼斯拒绝参与暴力行为时并不令人惊讶——如果哈拉斯特死去，那对尤戈洛斯来说将少了一个头疼的问题。不幸的是，它受契约约束，不能伤害哈拉斯特——但其他三个恶魔却没有这个限制。",

	"Halaster returns to fight the party, but only {@dice 1d10} days later, per his Rejuvenation trait. Sometime later, he teleports the party back into the dungeon. The adventurers are likely to be commanding their full resources—but that's fine, because he's is meant to lose again anyway.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）返回与队伍战斗，但仅在{@dice 1d10}天后，根据他的“复原”特性。过了一段时间，他将队伍传送回地牢。冒险者们可能会动用所有资源——但没关系，因为无论如何他都注定会再次失败。",
	"When the party first reaches Halaster, run the encounter exactly as it is in WDMM: a battle with an {@creature empyrean|MM} followed by a lackluster fight with a wizard that made no preparations for this inevitable conflict. He follows his normal tactics but lacks a {@spell contingency} spell, potions, and minions. His tower collapses as normal when he's slain.": "当冒险小组第一次到达哈拉斯特(Halaster)时，请按照《WDMM》中的情节进行：首先是与一个{@creature empyrean|MM}的战斗，然后是与一名没有为这场不可避免的冲突做任何准备的巫师进行一场平淡无奇的战斗。他会按照正常战术行动，但缺少{@spell contingency}法术、药水和手下。当他被杀死时，他的塔会像平常一样倒塌。",
	"Halaster resurrects {@dice 1d10} days later and {@spell wish|PHB|wishes} them back into Undermountain. With his tower destroyed, he summons them to L15, A16—atop the spectral bridge that spans Netherskull's smoldering chasm. From Area 17 Halaster hurls his spells while his minions advance from both ends of the bridge.": "哈拉斯特{@dice 1d10}天后复活，并将他们{@spell wish|PHB|wishes}送回地下山。随着他的塔楼被摧毁，他将他们召唤到L15，A16—在横跨尼瑟斯克尔冒烟深渊的幽灵桥顶端。从第17区，哈拉斯特施放他的法术，而他的手下则从桥的两端前进。",
	"For this encounter, you must prepare the map of L15.": "为了这次遭遇，你必须准备 L15 的地图。",
	"The adventurers begin 40 ft. from Area 9—as Halaster wants them to head north and trigger the {@spell fireball|PHB} trap (see below).": "冒险者们距离9区域有40英尺—哈拉斯特希望他们向北走，触发{@spell fireball|PHB}陷阱（见下文）。",
	"Keep these in mind for the battle:": "在战斗中记住这些事项：",

	"Spells and magic items that grant flight are suppressed in the chasm. A character that enters under a {@spell fly} spell or similar magic instead goes hurtling into the lava. Spells that slow one's fall, such as {@spell feather fall}, function normally.": "在深渊中，能让人飞行的法术和魔法物品会被压制。如果一个角色进入时施放了{@spell fly}法术或类似魔法，那么他会被迫坠入岩浆中。而像{@spell feather fall}这样减缓坠落速度的法术则会正常发挥作用。",
	"Per Area 16, whenever a creature on the bridge crosses the midpoint of the span, there's a {@chance 75|25% chance|Fireball!|Nothing happens.|The Lava pool spouts a fireball!} that the lava pool spouts a {@spell fireball|PHB} (save {@dc 19}, {@damage 12d6} fire damage on a failure or half as much on a success) that explodes at a point centered on that creature.": "根据第16区域规定，每当桥上的生物穿过跨度的中点时，有{@chance 75|25% chance|Fireball!|Nothing happens.|The Lava pool spouts a fireball!}的几率熔岩池喷出{@spell fireball|PHB}(豁免{@dc 19}，失败则受到{@damage 12d6}火焰伤害，成功则减半)的爆炸，在以该生物为中心的点上发生。",
	"The lava is 30 ft. below the bridge. Because lava is denser than most creatures, a character that falls onto the lava takes {@damage 3d10} bludgeoning damage, plus the {@damage 10d10} fire damage for entering or starting its turn there.": "岩浆在桥下30英尺处。由于岩浆比大多数生物更密，一个角色掉落到岩浆中会受到{@damage 3d10} 钝击伤害，再加上{@damage 10d10} 火焰伤害，这是因为进入或在那里开始其回合。",

On a check that fails by 5 or more, the creature slips and falls into the lava.": "峡谷的墙壁倾斜且有丰富的抓握处，可以通过成功的 {@dc 10} 力量 ({@skill Athletics}) 检定来攀爬。如果检定失败超过5点，生物会滑倒并掉入岩浆中。",
	"The following minions fly above the chasm; because their flight is not granted by a spell or magic item, they do not plummet into the fiery depths below.": "以下爪牙飞越深渊；因为它们的飞行并非由法术或魔法物品赋予，所以它们不会坠入下方炽热的深渊。",

	"Four {@creature Constructed Archer|WDMMC|constructs carved in the likeness of Halaster} pepper the adventurers with arrows from Area 9. They are {@creature Constructed Archer|WDMMC|archers but count as constructs, and have immunity to both psychic and poison damage}, as well as the {@condition poisoned} condition. Should the party storm Area 9, one of the constructs opens the double door (see Area 9, Level 15), activating a random elder rune that affects all creatures in the room.

	"The Mad Mage employs these tactics, in addition to his normal ones:": "疯狂法师（The Mad Mage）除了他正常的战术外，还采用这些战术：",

	"If you'd like to insert more battles with Halaster into your story without actually using precious in-game time for it, narrate that over the course of the next several weeks or months, the party is just repeatedly conjured by Halaster for battle after battle. Often he conjures them to the dark depths of Undermountain, but he also ambushes them on the surface: at their inn, while they're getting a haircut, at a carnival in which he challenges them to a ring toss, and more. No matter what, it seems they cannot escape his shadow. Each time, they emerge victorious; each time the Mad Mage returns, more frenzied than the last—until there comes a period in which he does not bother them. That's when you begin Round 3, the final encounter, below.": "如果你想在故事中增加更多与哈拉斯特(Halaster)的战斗，而又不想浪费宝贵的游戏时间，可以叙述在接下来的几周或几个月里，队伍被哈拉斯特反复召唤进行一场又一场的战斗。他经常将他们召唤到安德山的黑暗深处，但也会在地面上伏击他们：在他们的旅馆里，当他们在理发时，在一个嘉年华上，他向他们发起飞环挑战等等。无论如何，他们似乎无法摆脱他的阴影。每一次，他们都获得胜利；每一次，疯狂的疯狂法师比上一次更加狂乱——直到有一个时期他不再打扰他们。这时，你可以开始第三回合，也就是最后的决战。",
	"Like a scorned toddler, Halaster has deigned to take out his fetal rage on the entire world—by knocking Stardock out of orbit and crashing it into Waterdeep. There upon the asteroid's craggy surface, the party must defeat Halaster to spare the world an extinction level event.": "就像一个被蔑视的幼儿，哈拉斯特(Halaster)决定将他的胎儿般的愤怒发泄在整个世界上——通过将星码站(Stardock)撞出轨道并坠毁在水深渊(Waterdeep)。在这颗小行星崎岖的表面上，队伍必须击败哈拉斯特，以避免世界面临一场灭绝级事件。",
	"Unlike Round 2, it isn't Halaster who conjures the adventurers, but Jhesiyra herself. Although she is no saint, she cannot abide the Mad Mage's lunacy any longer—especially since the asteroid is aimed at Waterdeep itself and will destroy most of Undermountain.": "与第2轮不同的是，不是哈拉斯特（Halaster）召唤冒险者，而是杰西拉（Jhesiyra）本人。尽管她并非圣人，但她再也无法容忍疯狂法师的疯狂了——尤其是因为这颗小行星瞄准的是水深之都本身，将摧毁大部分地下山（Undermountain）。",
	"The Mad Mage has lost himself to insanity. He would rather destroy his toys than let others play with them. Alas, he cannot crash an asteroid on his own and required additional magi. Eager to see this carnage wrought upon the world, fiends of all stripes have volunteered for this effort. These co-conspirators care little for their own self-destruction, for they shall return to the Lower Planes where they will be lauded as heroes. Even Halaster is unconcerned, as he's certain the Knot in the Weave will survive to resurrect him in the collapsed remains of Undermountain.": "疯狂法师已经陷入疯狂。他宁愿摧毁自己的玩具，也不愿让别人玩。然而，他无法独自将一颗小行星撞击到地球上，需要更多的魔法师。渴望看到这场浩劫降临世界的恶魔们自愿加入了这场努力。这些同谋者对自己的自我毁灭毫不在意，因为他们将返回下层位面，在那里被奉为英雄。就连哈拉斯特也毫不担心，因为他确信编织中的结节会幸存下来，在安德瞳山的废墟中让他复活。",
	"Halaster neglected to tell the dragons and githyanki of his plans, but they've discovered them anyway. His fiendish army proved too much to handle, and so they fled through the gateway leading to the Crystal Labyrinth and hopped into the pits that empty out into the Astral Plane.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）没有告诉龙族和吉思安奇（githyanki）他的计划，但他们还是发现了。他的恶魔军队实在太强大了，所以他们逃到了通往水晶迷宫（Crystal Labyrinth）的门户，并跳进了通向星界（Astral Plane）的深渊。",
	"This encounter requires the Level 16 map.": "这次遭遇需要16级地图。",

	"Once again, you've been ripped away from your well-earned rest. It does not surprise you that the Mad Mage lives again—but what does surprise you is the tone of this most recent kidnapping. There's a distinct lack of... chicanery. A reek of desperation hangs heavy in the air, heavy in your mind. The chamber you stand in is familiar—and you realize that you aren't on Toril anymore, but back on the orbiting asteroid you visited long ago. Inertia rocks the asteroid and your stomach.": "你又一次被从你辛苦赚来的休息中扯走。疯狂法师再次复活并不让你惊讶，但最近这次绑架的口气却让你感到意外。这里缺乏...诡计。绝望的气息笼罩在空气中，也笼罩在你的脑海中。你站立的房间很熟悉——你意识到你不再在托瑞尔了，而是回到了你很久以前访问过的轨道小行星上。惯性摇晃着小行星和你的胃。",
	"It's while you're holding onto your lunch that a voice visits your mind. It whispers, \"The Mad Mage! His fetal rage will cost the very world!

GO!\"": "就在你紧紧抓住午餐时，一股声音突然出现在你的脑海中。它低语道：“疯狂法师！他那胎儿般的愤怒将毁灭整个世界！他已经将小行星撞出轨道，瞄准了沃特德普！瞄准了托瑞尔大陆！谋杀是我们唯一剩下的解决方案！快去吧，现在就去！快去！”",
	"The doors fly open, revealing the swollen mass of the blue planet below—and it's getting closer. At the docks, {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} watches, his arms spread out as if to embrace this wanton destruction. Countless creatures so horrid that they can only hail from the deepest of Hells crawl along the docks, supplicating themselves in worship of the imminent destruction and perhaps even Halaster himself.": "门飞开，露出下方蓝色行星的肿胀质量——而且它越来越近了。在码头，{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} 看着，他伸开双臂仿佛要拥抱这肆意的毁灭。无数可怕到只能来自地狱深处的生物沿着码头爬行，他们屈膝崇拜即将到来的毁灭，甚至可能是哈拉斯特(Halaster)本人。",
	"A throng of fiends stand between the adventurers and Halaster, described below, but only a few involve themselves in combat; the others must give their lives to propel the asteroid. The Mad Mage stays until the adventurers cut a path to him, after which he simply steps off the dock and winds up on the inverted side of the asteroid's gravity plane. He then runs onto Stardock's bottom, where other fiends continue their diabolical ritual.": "一群恶魔站在冒险者和哈拉斯特((Halaster))之间，但只有少数参与战斗；其他人必须献出生命来推动这颗小行星。这位疯狂法师会一直等到冒险者为他开辟一条道路，然后他简单地从码头上走下去，最终出现在小行星重力平面的反面。然后他跑到星码头的底部，在那里其他恶魔继续进行他们邪恶的仪式。",
	"Devils, all giddy with excitement, inhabit Area 20 and protect Halaster at all costs: an {@creature ice devil|MM}, two {@creature bearded devil|MM|bearded devils}, four {@creature spined devil|MM|spined devils}, and a {@creature blue abishai|MTF}.

	"Chasing after the Mad Mage, you step off the docks and let gravity reverse itself. What you see on the asteroid's underbelly can be described only as a Golgotha strewn with the tattered corpses of creatures so hellish, not even the most astute demonologists could categorize them.

	"On Stardock's underbelly, a horde of demons have just finished slaughtering each other, for every death is a well of power that Halaster can draw on to propel the asteroid.

	"On his first turn, {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} casts {@spell haste} on himself, enjoying the barrage of {@item Longsword|PHB} attacks he can unleash.": "在他的第一个回合，{@creature Trobriand|WDMM} 对自己施放 {@spell haste}，享受着他可以释放的一连串 {@item Longsword|PHB} 攻击。",
	"Once he's been wounded—likely on his third or fourth turn—{@creature Trobriand|WDMM} casts {@spell incendiary cloud}, centering it on himself. Not only does this inflict up to {@damage 10d8} damage on his foes, but it heals him for that much, thanks to his Fire Absorption trait. He intentionally fails the Dexterity saving throw imposed by the spell.": "一旦他受伤——可能是在他的第三或第四轮行动中——{@creature Trobriand|WDMM} 施放{@spell incendiary cloud}，以自己为中心。这不仅会对他的敌人造成高达{@damage 10d8}的伤害，而且由于他的火焰吸收特性，他也会被治愈同样的数值。他故意失败了法术施加的敏捷豁免投掷。",
	"While in the body of a golem, {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} uses his reactions to cast {@spell counterspell}.": "当在一个傀儡的身体里时，{@creature Trobriand|WDMM} 使用他的反应施放{@spell counterspell}。",
	"If foes try to leave the room, {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} casts {@spell chain lightning} if the spell can reach them. The spell does not specify that it cannot round corners between jumps.": "如果敌人试图离开房间，{@creature Trobriand|WDMM} 施放 {@spell chain lightning} 如果法术可以触及到他们。该法术并未规定在跳跃间不能绕过角落。",
	"If his body was not destroyed, {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} makes a thunderous return three rounds later, once his spirit has been ejected from the golem. His tactics change during this phase:": "如果他的身体没有被摧毁，{@creature Trobriand|WDMM} 三回合后会雷鸣般地回归，一旦他的灵魂被从傀儡中驱逐出来。在这个阶段，他的战术会发生改变：",
	"{@creature Trobriand|WDMM} gets three turns to prepare for his thunderous return to battle. First he casts {@spell greater invisibility} on himself; with his movement (after standing up from being {@condition prone}) he can get to Area 11B. On his second turn, he Dashes to get to just outside of 11A. On his third turn, he takes the {@action Ready} action to cast {@spell chain lightning} when the first adventurer comes from the hallway to Area 13.": "{@creature Trobriand|WDMM}有三个回合来准备他雷鸣般的回归战斗。首先他对自己施放{@spell greater invisibility};在他移动时(从被{@condition prone}站起后)，他可以到达11B区域。在他的第二个回合中，他猛冲，到达11A区域外。在第三个回合中，他采取{@action Ready}动作，在第一个冒险者从通道来到13区域时施放{@spell chain lightning}。",
	"On his fourth turn, {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} snaps out a {@spell power word kill}. The gloves are off now; he knows that this is life-or-death.": "在他的第四轮中，{@creature Trobriand|WDMM} 突然拿出了一个 {@spell power word kill}。现在不再留情；他知道这是生死存亡。",
	"While in his fragile body, {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} uses his reactions to cast {@spell shield} spells.": "在他脆弱的身体中，{@creature Trobriand|WDMM} 使用他的反应来施放{@spell shield}法术。",
	"If he needs to gain cover, {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} retreats to Area 11A and closes the doors.": "如果他需要寻找掩护，{@creature Trobriand|WDMM} 撤退到11A区域并关闭门。",
	"If the adventurers do not leave Area 13, {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} kicks open the doors (if they're not already open) and unleashes either a {@spell chain lightning} or {@spell fireball} spell cast up to 8th-level, if possible.": "如果冒险者不离开13区域，{@creature Trobriand|WDMM} 踢开门（如果门还没开）并释放一个8级以下的{@spell chain lightning} 或 {@spell fireball} 法术。",
	"When at Death's Door, {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} sputters, \"It needn't be this way! We can usurp the Mad Mage together!\" ({@creature Trobriand|WDMM} is earnest, although there can be no peace between them so long as The Elite Four is being ran.)": "当{@creature Trobriand|WDMM}濒临死亡时，他喃喃自语道：“没有必要这样！我们可以一起推翻疯狂法师！”({@creature Trobriand|WDMM})是认真的，尽管在四天王仍在位的情况下，他们之间不可能和平相处。",
	"If you're running this variant, {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} is strangely absent from this area until the party's teleported here by Halaster, so that he can't be killed prematurely.": "如果你在运行这个变体，{@creature Trobriand|WDMM} 在这个区域里会奇怪地消失，直到哈拉斯特将队伍传送到这里，这样他就不会被过早杀死。",
	"When the adventurers enter this room, the brooms, which are animated and can speak, but not attack, are performing a play of your choosing. Singing Be Our Guest from Beauty and the Beast is also appropriate.": "当冒险者们进入这个房间时，扫帚们，它们被赋予了生命并能够说话，但不能攻击，正在表演您选择的一出戏剧。唱着《美女与野兽》中的《Be Our Guest》也是很合适的。",
	"If there are any items you're itching to give your party, such as a lost memento, or a MacGuffin, here is a rather anticlimactic place to leave it.": "如果有任何物品你渴望给你的队伍，比如一个失落的纪念品，或者一个MacGuffin，这里是一个相当缺乏悬念的地方来放置它。",
	"If you're running this twist, then a nonmagical weapon belonging to one of the party members is among the brooms. It is an exact copy of their weapon, down to the last detail. It cannot be a weapon the adventurer lost, as they'll assume that the Mad Mage simply retrieved it.": "如果你正在运行这个扭曲（Twist），那么其中一把属于其中一名队伍成员的非魔法武器就藏在扫帚中。这把武器是他们武器的精确复制，细节完全一样。它不能是冒险者丢失的武器，因为他们会认为疯狂法师（Mad Mage）只是简单地取回了它。",
	"It shouldn't surprise you to hear music in this lair, but still it sends shivers up your spine—and it's because there's no warmth in it. You never thought music could be cold. It's as if all of winter opened its throat to sing.": "在这个巢穴里听到音乐应该不会让你感到惊讶，但它仍然让你背脊发凉——因为其中没有温暖。你从未想过音乐也可以如此冰冷。就好像整个冬天都张开喉咙在歌唱。",
	"When you throw open those doors to this atelier, you note first the swarm of butterflies plucking at a harp. All together, they vaguely resemble a humanoid. It's the animal-headed servants you see first, each brandishing blades or feather dusters. These freaks number six in all: one with the head of a dingo, another with an iguana, and—if you can believe it—a stork; others bear the heads of a shrew, an aardvark and a macabre head that can only belong to a moth.": "当你推开这个工作室的门时，首先注意到一群蝴蝶在弹奏竖琴。它们一起模糊地呈现出一个类似人形的形状。你首先看到的是动物头的仆人，每个人手持刀剑或羽毛扫帚。这些怪物总共有六个：一个头像澳洲野犬，另一个是鬣蜥，还有一个——如果你能相信的话——是一只鹳；其他的有着鼩鼱、土豚和只能属于蛾子的恐怖头颅。",
	"At the center of it all is a blue-skinned woman adorned with gossamer wings. Lifting up her skirts, she dances gaily upon a pedestal. Her fingers are tipped in claws and bone spurs jut from her forearms and elbows. It's only when you smell the rot do you realize she's a gussied-up {@creature lich|MM} that has cheated the skeletal disfigurements such undead are forced to bear.": "在这一切的中心是一位穿着薄纱翅膀的蓝皮肤女人。她掀起裙摆，在基座上欢快地跳舞。她的手指尖带着爪子，骨刺从她的前臂和肘部突出。只有当你闻到腐臭时，你才意识到她是一位打扮得漂亮的{@creature lich|MM}，逃过了不死生物被迫承受的骨骼畸形。",
	"As mercurial as her magic, {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} has a volatile temperament. She can fly into a rage just as easily as she can relax to fine music. If she decides to betray the adventurers, her attack is as sudden as it is treacherous.": "就像她的魔法一样善变，{@creature Arcturia|WDMM} 的脾气也很不稳定。她可以像听着美妙音乐一样轻松，也可以突然暴怒。如果她决定背叛冒险者，她的攻击会突如其来，十分狡诈。",
	"Of the Seven, {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} has always been the most devoted to Halaster. Older modules and materials even imply that she loves him. Embracing this tidbit, the {@i Companion} suggests roleplaying her as an unrequited admirer, one perpetually envious of the few individuals Halaster cares for, such as Tasselgryn Velldarn (the {@creature archmage|MM} of Skullport, whom he oft visits) or even the adventurers, who he gives so much of his attention—especially if Halaster has gone on and on about how he expects one to become his newest apprentice.": "在七位之中，{@creature Arcturia|WDMM} 一直是最忠诚于哈拉斯特的。早期模组和资料甚至暗示她爱他。借此细节，{@i Companion} 建议将她塑造成一个一厢情愿的崇拜者，一个永远羡慕哈拉斯特关心的少数人，比如塔瑟尔格林·维尔达恩（斯库尔港的{@creature archmage|MM}，他经常拜访的人）或者甚至那些冒险者，哈拉斯特给予他们如此多的关注—尤其是如果哈拉斯特一再谈论他期待有人成为他的最新学徒。",
	"With no one else to find true companionship with, {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} has bonded with the many {@creature mimic|MM|mimics} that lair in this atelier of hers. They are her chief confidants; killing one sends her into a frenzy of wild grief.": "在没有其他人能够真正交心的情况下，{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}与居住在她工作室的众多{@creature mimic|MM|mimics}建立了联系。它们是她最亲密的知己；杀死其中一个会让她陷入狂热的悲伤之中。",
	"{@creature Arcturia|WDMM} and her minions (twelve {@creature mimic|MM|mimics} and three {@creature champion|VGM|champions}, one of which who sides against her and shall be referred to as \"Dingo\" below) use the following tactics in battle:": "{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}和她的手下（十二{@creature mimic|MM|mimics}和三{@creature champion|VGM|champions}，其中一个背叛她并被称为“Dingo”）在战斗中使用以下战术：",
	"Above all else, {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} is spiteful. She tries to inflict the most harm on someone, such as by disfigurement or {@spell feeblemind}.": "最重要的是，{@creature Arcturia|WDMM} 是怀恨在心的。她试图对某人造成最大的伤害，比如毁容或{@spell feeblemind}。",
	"{@creature Arcturia|WDMM} treasures her {@creature mimic|MM} companions and does her best not to harm them, which greatly influences her tactics. She won't, for example, cast an area-of-effect spell, like {@spell fireball|PHB}, if it will include the {@creature mimic|MM|mimics}.": "{@creature Arcturia|WDMM} 珍惜她的{@creature mimic|MM} 伙伴，并尽力不伤害他们，这极大地影响了她的战术。例如，她不会施放像{@spell fireball|PHB} 这样的范围法术，如果其中包括{@creature mimic|MM|mimics}。",
	"On her first turn, {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} moves to the back of the room and casts {@spell reverse gravity}, centering the cylinder on the doors so as to escape its influence. Creatures that fall upwards take {@damage 3d6} bludgeoning damage when they strike the ceiling.": "在她的第一个回合中，{@creature Arcturia|WDMM} 移动到房间的后面，并施放{@spell reverse gravity}，将圆柱体的中心放在门上，以便逃离其影响。向上掉落的生物撞到天花板时会受到{@damage 3d6} 钝击伤害。",
	"On her second turn, {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} casts {@spell feeblemind}, targeting the foe she envies the most (such as a spellcaster Halaster has gone on and on about and wants to take on as an apprentice).": "在她的第二轮中，{@creature Arcturia|WDMM} 施放了{@spell feeblemind}，瞄准了她最嫉妒的敌人（比如一个哈拉斯特一直在谈论并想要收为学徒的法师）。",
	"On her third turn, or when she's been reduced to 63 hit points or less, {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} casts {@spell true polymorph} on herself, assuming the statistics of an {@creature adult red dragon}, the statistics of which are provided in Appendix B. Per Monster Manual Errata, {@spell true polymorph} does not grant the target access to that creature's Legendary Actions, but it does grant them its Legendary Resistance.": "在她的第三轮，或者当她的生命值降至63点或更低时，{@creature Arcturia|WDMM} 对自己施放{@spell true polymorph}，假设她的统计数据是一个{@creature adult red dragon}，其统计数据在附录B中提供。根据《怪物手册勘误表》，{@spell true polymorph} 不会授予目标使用该生物的传奇动作的权限，但会授予他们传奇抗性。",
	"{@creature Arcturia|WDMM|Arcturia's} reactions are reserved for {@spell counterspell||counterspells} until she is at 75 hit points or fewer.": "{@creature Arcturia|WDMM|Arcturia's} 反应保留给 {@spell counterspell||counterspells}，直到她的生命值降至 75 点或更少。",
	"{@creature Arcturia|WDMM} prioritizes disabling her foes over inflicting damage. Her first Legendary Action is spent on Paralyzing Touch (if any targets are in range) or Frightening Gaze. Thereafter, she uses Cantrip or Paralyzing Touch, as she's loathe to harm her {@creature mimic|MM|mimics}. Once they're dead, she busts out Disrupt Life.": "{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}优先选择让敌人失去行动能力，而不是造成伤害。她的第一个传奇行动将用于麻痹之触（如果有目标在范围内）或恐惧凝视。之后，她会使用杂耍或麻痹之触，因为她不愿伤害她的{@creature mimic|MM|mimics}。一旦他们死了，她会使用生命干扰。",
	"If {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} wins the battle, she casts {@spell flesh to stone} on the last combatants. Later, after a rest, she {@spell true polymorph|PHB|true polymorphs} them into an animal-headed servant.": "如果{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}赢得了战斗，她会对最后的战斗者施放{@spell flesh to stone}。稍后，休息后，她会将他们变成一个动物头的仆人。",
	"{@creature Arcturia|WDMM} is an unparalleled transmuter with the {@spell true polymorph} spell at her disposal, allowing her to turn into a CR 21 or lower creature. While it would be easy for her—and therefore, you—to abuse this spell, the {@i Companion} recommends using tact instead. The same goes for {@spell polymorph}, which she could cast over and over to gain more hit points and prolong this fight.": "{@creature Arcturia|WDMM} 是一位无与伦比的变形术士，拥有{@spell true polymorph} 法术，使她能够变身为CR 21或更低级别的生物。虽然她可以轻易地滥用这个法术，但{@i Companion} 建议谨慎使用。对于{@spell polymorph} 也是如此，她可以反复施放以获得更多生命值，延长这场战斗。",
	"Additionally, consider the following whenever {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} casts {@spell true polymorph} or {@spell polymorph}:": "此外，每当{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}施放{@spell true polymorph}或{@spell polymorph}时，请考虑以下内容：",
	"Area 17 has a 20-foot-high ceiling.": "17区的天花板高20英尺。",
	"Per Monster Manual Errata, a {@spell polymorph|PHB|polymorphed} target doesn't gain the Legendary Actions of the creature whose form it assumes. It does, however, grant its Legendary Resistance trait.": "根据《怪物手册勘误表》，{@spell polymorph|PHB|polymorphed}目标不会获得其所模拟生物的传奇行动。然而，它会获得传奇抗性特性。",
	"{@creature Arcturia|WDMM} has a special kinship with her {@creature mimic|MM|mimics} and would rather not flatten them.": "{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}与她的{@creature mimic|MM|mimics}有特殊的亲缘关系，宁愿不伤害他们。",
	"At the end of the day, D&D is about having fun. It's up to you as how to {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} uses her {@spell polymorph} spells, but the {@i Companion} argues that less is more, which comes out in the tactics above.": "在一天结束时，D&D 的目的在于享受乐趣。你可以决定如何使用她的{@spell polymorph}法术，但{@i Companion}认为少即是多，这体现在上面的战术中。",
	"In this area, Halaster's music is muted. Instead, play Blue Kid's Dismemberment Song, which is sung by {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} and played by her butterfly-swarm-humanoids. All necessary instruments are provided.": "在这个区域，哈拉斯特的音乐被消音了。相反，播放蓝孩子的《解体之歌》，由{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}演唱，并由她的蝴蝶群人形生物演奏。所有必要的乐器都已准备好。",
	"Described in the Halaster's Game supplement and featured on L9 and L14, the Cheeky Pluckers were amateur adventurers that fell into {@creature Arcturia|WDMM|Arcturia's} clutches. If any still survive, then {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} is cutting one open on a {@creature mimic|MM} in the form of a surgeon's table. She sings the Dismemberment Song. The dingo-headed {@creature champion|VGM} is Fiona dé Vaun and sides with the adventurers against {@creature Arcturia|WDMM}.": "在《哈拉斯特的游戏》补充内容中描述，并出现在L9和L14中，顽皮弹拨者是业余冒险者，落入{@creature Arcturia|WDMM|Arcturia's}的掌控中。如果仍有幸存者，那么{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}正在一个{@creature mimic|MM}上剖开其中一个，形似外科手术台。她唱着《肢解之歌》。那个长着丁果头的{@creature champion|VGM}是Fiona dé Vaun，支持冒险者对抗{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}。",
	"If you're running this penultimate encounter, then {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} is absent from this area until it begins. Her {@creature mimic|MM|mimics} stay hidden. The Cheeky Pluckers, if they're included, are here as well.": "如果你正在进行这个倒数第二次遭遇，那么{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}在这个区域中是缺席的，直到它开始。她{@creature mimic|MM|mimics}会保持隐藏。如果包括了顽皮的弹拨手(The Cheeky Pluckers)，它们也在这里。",
	"Cracking open the next door unleashes a frenzy of thunder: the hallway writhes and undulates like a worm high on moondust. Slowly, you close the door, muting the cacophony. Taking a deep breath, you prepare yourself for this chicanery.": "打开下一扇门时，一阵雷鸣般的狂乱被释放出来：走廊像是一条吸食了月尘的蠕虫般扭动起来。慢慢地，你关闭了门，消除了混乱的喧嚣。深吸一口气，你为这场欺诈做好了准备。",
	"The winds of fate blow you towards a chamber marked with seven sets of iron doors, each decorated with a mosaic of the Mad Mage in a seductive pose. At the chamber's heart stands a scintillating pillar wounded with deep notches. Within these notches flash a rainbow of lights, fiery and beautiful. Seven doors. You know it in your heart that one, if not all, leads to the Mad Mage. What's the catch?": "命运之风将你吹向一个房间，上面标着七扇铁门，每扇门上都装饰着一个疯狂法师的马赛克图案，他摆出诱人的姿势。在房间的中心，有一根闪闪发光的柱子，上面刻满了深深的凹槽。在这些凹槽里闪烁着一道美丽而火热的彩虹光芒。七扇门。你心里明白，其中一扇，甚至所有的门，都通向疯狂法师。问题在哪里？",
	"As described in Penultimate Encounters, Area 19 is the site of the Prismatic Gauntlet challenge. If you're running this encounter, a {@spell prismatic wall} spell stands between the eastern tunnel and the chamber's heart.": "正如《倒数第二次相遇》所述，第19区域是多彩护手挑战的场所。如果你正在进行这次遭遇，一项{@spell prismatic wall}法术位于东隧道和房间核心之间。",
	"Two of the optional twists can play a part here:": "这里可以加入两个可选的转折点：",
	"If you're running this optional twist, then the remains of two alternate-selves can be found in front of the north and northeastern doors. The first remains are still-smoldering ashes; the other remains are acid-scorched bones.": "如果你选择运行这个可选的扭曲，那么在北门和东北门前可以找到两个替代自我的遗骸。第一个遗骸仍然是冒着烟的灰烬；另一个遗骸是被酸腐蚀的骨骼。",
	"When a character opens the wrong set of doors, they behold a flash of a chaotic realm of boundless energy—the Knot in the Weave. Under this variant, the pillar at the heart of Area 19 doesn't emit the {@spell prismatic spray} spell, but the Knot in the Weave does from the doorway. Characters that see the Knot also see the silhouette of a man trapped in the knot's center.": "当一个角色打开错误的门时，他们会看到一个充满无尽能量的混沌领域的闪光——纹织之结。根据这个变体规则，在区域19中心的柱子不会释放{@spell prismatic spray}法术，但纹织之结会从门口释放。看到纹织之结的角色也会看到一个被困在结的中心的男人的轮廓。",
	"Tucked into this chamber, as if it were some prize or secret, is a gilded throne with no hall to loom over, no subjects to dazzle. Its black velvet is embroidered with silver stars, as if it calls out to the night skies you once dreamt under.": "藏在这个房间里，仿佛是某种奖励或秘密，是一把没有大厅可以屹立，没有臣民可以迷惑的镀金宝座。它的黑丝绒上绣着银色星星，仿佛在呼唤你曾经梦想的夜空。",

	"If the {@creature ultroloth|MM|ultroloths} attack from Area 21, they use the following tactics:": "如果{@creature ultroloth|MM|ultroloths}从21区发动攻击，他们会采取以下战术：",
	"The fiends are already {@status concentration||concentrating} on {@spell clairvoyance} spells to watch Area 20, which they end to free up their {@status concentration} for better spells, but at the cost of their vision in Area 20. To make up for this, two {@creature ultroloth|MM|ultroloths} cast {@spell dimension door}, each bringing along a companion. Before doing so, each fiend enshrouds itself in a {@spell darkness} spell—which it can see through, thanks to its {@sense truesight}. Teleporting into the chamber most likely surprises the adventurers, since the fiends can do so from 500 ft. away.": "恶魔们已经{@status concentration||concentrating}在{@spell clairvoyance}咒语上投入了注意力，他们结束了对第20区域的监视，以释放他们的{@status concentration}以施放更强大的咒语，但这是以失去对第20区域的视野为代价。为了弥补这一点，两个{@creature ultroloth|MM|ultroloths}施放了{@spell dimension door}，每人带了一个同伴。在这之前，每个恶魔都用一个{@spell darkness}咒语将自己笼罩起来——由于他们的{@sense truesight}，他们可以透过这个咒语看到。从500英尺外传送到房间里很可能会让冒险者感到惊讶，因为恶魔可以这样做。",
	"On their second turn, the first and second {@creature ultroloth|MM|ultroloths} each make three melee attacks, prioritizing targets already {@condition stunned} by its companions. Once a fiend loses {@status concentration} on its {@spell darkness} spell, it uses its Hypnotic Gaze, now that its foes can see it.": "在它们的第二轮中，第一和第二名{@creature ultroloth|MM|ultroloths}分别进行三次近战攻击，优先攻击已经被它的同伴{@condition stunned}的目标。一旦一个恶魔在其{@spell darkness}法术上失去{@status concentration}，它就会使用其催眠凝视，现在它的敌人可以看到它了。",
	"On its first turn, the third {@creature ultroloth|MM} casts {@spell fire storm} on the party. On its second, it casts {@spell fear}, which ends its {@spell darkness} spell. On its third, if it gets one, it uses its Hypnotic Gaze and makes three {@item longsword|PHB} attacks.": "在第一个回合，第三名{@creature ultroloth|MM}对全体施放{@spell fire storm}。在第二个回合，它施放{@spell fear}，这结束了它的{@spell darkness}法术。在第三个回合，如果有机会，它使用催眠凝视并进行三次{@item longsword|PHB}攻击。",
	"On its first turn, the fourth {@creature ultroloth|MM} casts {@spell wall of fire}, dividing the party if possible, after its {@spell dimension door|PHB|dimension doored} into Area 20. This ends its {@spell darkness} spell. On its later turns, it uses its Hypnotic Gaze and follows up with three melee attacks.": "在第一个回合，第四个{@creature ultroloth|MM} 施放 {@spell wall of fire}，如果可能的话将队伍分开，然后在它的{@spell dimension door|PHB|dimension doored}进入20区域。这结束了它的{@spell darkness}法术。在后续回合中，它使用催眠凝视，然后进行三次近战攻击。",

	"If the {@creature ultroloth|MM|ultroloths} detect the adventurers—easily done with their {@spell clairvoyance} spells in Area 20—they first cast {@spell invisibility} on themselves (granting advantage to their +8 {@skill Stealth} checks), then take Readied actions to spring the following tactics below once the party is in position.": "如果{@creature ultroloth|MM|ultroloths}探测到冒险者——在第20区使用他们的{@spell clairvoyance}法术很容易——他们首先对自己施放{@spell invisibility}（为他们+8{@skill Stealth}检定提供优势），然后准备动作，一旦队伍就位就执行以下战术。",
	"The first {@creature ultroloth|MM} encases the adventurers within a {@spell wall of fire} spell, making it 20 feet in diameter.

	"It comes as no surprise when the mirror's surface warbles, depicting now a red desert. A gnome stranded there blinks at you; she cries, \"You! Can you hear me? Please, for the love of all that's right, get me outta this thing!\"": "当镜子的表面扭曲时，展现出一片红色沙漠，这一点并不令人惊讶。一个被困在那里的侏儒向你眨眼，她哭着说：“你！你能听到我吗？拜托，看在一切正义的份上，把我从这里救出来！”",

	"As noted in WDMM, the gnome has been trapped so long she has forgotten her own name and history. Freedom is her only objective. Unfortunately, she can't provide information about Halaster's lair, if she ever had any to begin with.": "正如《WDMM》中所述，这位侏儒被困得太久，已经忘记了自己的名字和历史。自由是她唯一的目标。不幸的是，她无法提供有关哈拉斯特巢穴的信息，如果她曾经有的话。",

The silvered surface cracks easily enough and the shards fly.": "你无法确定打破这个监狱不会杀死它唯一的囚犯——但你还是这样做了。那个侏儒发出了满足的叹息，仿佛没有比她已经面对的命运更糟糕的了。银色表面很容易破裂，碎片四处飞溅。",

She picks herself up from the debris, caring not that her hands are red and slick with blood.": "本能地，你掩住眼睛，唯恐玻璃或魔法会让你失明。在事后，你听到一种只能用可听见的幸福来形容的声音。侏儒！侏儒被释放了！她从残骸中爬起来，毫不在意她的手已被鲜血染红而滑腻。",
	"\"Thank you!\" she cries. \"Gods above, thank—\" As she opens her arms to embrace you, she and you notice how quickly her hand has deteriorated. Before she can even gasp, it turns to dust.

	"While in this area, Halaster plays America's A Horse With No Name. The mirror's background becomes, of course, a desert to better reflect this.": "在这个区域，哈拉斯特(Halaster) 播放着美国的《没有名字的马》(A Horse With No Name)。镜子的背景当然变成了沙漠，以更好地反映这一点。",
	"At last, you come upon the Mad Mage's potion brewery—no doubt the source of many a man's doom. Shelves line the walls, the upper reaches accessible only to those that climb the rickety ladder lain against the sides.": "最后，你来到了疯狂法师的药水酿造厂——毫无疑问，这里是许多人厄运的根源。架子沿着墙壁排列，只有那些爬上靠在两侧的摇摇欲坠的梯子的人才能够到达上层。",

Magic sparks from its tip as the sentient wand points at you!": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）的雪花石半身像从基座上冲你瞪眼，仿佛他们疯狂的笑容中隐藏着某个他们渴望与你分享的伟大秘密。当你与其中一个对视时，半身像竟然真的转向了房间中心——所有的半身像都这样做了。就在这时，面纱落下，显露出一个被金色球体环绕的漂浮魔杖。魔法从其尖端迸发，当这根有意识的魔杖指向你时！",

The pain, the suffering—and after all that, the Mad Mage can't even be bothered to show up.": "在你心中，你知道真相：很少有人曾经看到过这个——这个，疯狂法师的圣所，{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}统治地下山的权力之源。在你的脑海中，你清楚地看到了带领你来到这里的尸体之路。痛苦，苦难——而在这一切之后，疯狂法师甚至都懒得出现。",
	"The chamber is empty! Empty but for a circle of runes, a statue of Halaster (riding a donkey and nude but for a wide-brimmed hat) and an empty throne fashioned from purple marble, behind which are heaps of ancient tomes haphazardly stacked together.": "房间是空的！除了一圈符文、一个哈拉斯特(Halaster)雕像（骑在一头驴上，只穿着一顶宽边帽）和一个用紫色大理石制成的空王座，座后堆满了古老的书籍，堆放得乱七八糟。",
	"Nothing is louder than pained silence and that's what you hear here. Silence. Not the quiet thrum of magic. Not the lunatic-howls you've grown deaf to. Nothing. What has this all been for if the Mad Mage would deprive you of catharsis?": "没有什么比痛苦的沉默更响亮，这就是你在这里听到的。沉默。不是魔法的轻微颤动声。也不是你已经变得聋的疯狂嚎叫声。什么都没有。如果疯狂法师会剥夺你的宣泄，这一切又是为了什么呢？",

	"Halaster's voice seeps in from every darkened corner of this chamber—and for once, his voice is plain, not telepathic. It bounces from every brick but does not penetrate your mind.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）的声音从这个房间的每个黑暗角落渗入进来—而且这一次，他的声音是真实的，而不是心灵感应的。它从每块砖头上反弹，但并没有渗透进你的头脑。",
	"\"The day has come. The day has come at long last. Do you know for how long I've waited here? For how long I've suffered your absence? How long I've longed for you—a worthy opponent?

Her master has long wondered where she went and was devastated by her abandonment—and he's furious.

	"As Halaster weeps red, a vision overwhelms your mind: the tower. The tower and where it stands in that field of polished grass. Only now do you see it; only now do you understand it: every blade, every drop of dew is an entire universe spinning in its own orbit, shivering in whatever strange wind ripples across the meadow. There are other worlds than these—haven't you already seen omens of that stark truth?": "当哈拉斯特(Halaster)流泪变红时，一个愈发强烈的幻象充斥着你的脑海：那座塔。那座塔及其所处的那片磨光草地。只有现在你才看见它；只有现在你才理解它：每一根草叶，每一滴露水都是一个完整的宇宙，在自己的轨道上旋转，在草地上涟漪的奇风中颤抖。除了这些世界，还有其他世界——难道你还没有看到那个残酷真相的预兆吗？",
	"As that psychic wind howls, you hear another sound: a heartbeat. You look down and now can see it far below the earth, pumping out its invisible blood and influence, infecting everything in Undermountain. It is a knot in the Weave, a font of almost sentient magic.": "随着那股精神之风的呼啸，你听到另一个声音：一颗心跳的声音。你低头看去，现在可以看到它远在地底之下，无形地泵送着它的血液和影响力，感染着地下城的一切。它是魔网中的一个结，几乎是有意识的魔法之源。",

	"If you're using the {@i Companion's} game show element or adding it as a twist, during the battle, the walls of A33 seemingly fall away, revealing a legion of spectators—the audience watching the live finale of Dungeon of the Mad Mage. Should a character press themselves against a wall, they can feel phantom hands groping at their ankles like fans at a concert. These individuals—mortal, demonic, angelic, or just alien—are real and sit together on the Ethereal Plane, all enmities and grudges forgotten for the sake of enjoying good television.": "如果你正在使用{@i Companion's}游戏节目元素或将其作为一个转折，战斗中，A33的墙壁似乎消失了，揭示出一群观众——观看《疯狂法师的地牢》直播终极大结局的观众。如果角色靠在墙上，他们会感觉到幽灵般的手在摸索着他们的脚踝，就像音乐会上的粉丝一样。这些个体——凡人、恶魔、天使，或者只是外星人——都是真实存在的，他们一起坐在以太界，为了享受精彩的电视节目而忘记了所有的仇恨和怨恨。",
	"As Halaster lays dying, he murmurs, \"I thought this time it would be different. I thought...\" Alternatively, if the adventurers aren't already in a time-loop, have Halaster start the cycle now with a {@spell wish} spell.

	"Halaster's corpse crashes to the floor; the very tower rumbles with thunder! Cracks web out from his form and with a sick feeling, you understand that this place is about to collapse. As another tremor rocks the lair, a chasm splits open, letting in violet light so blinding and intense, you fear it might rot the flesh from your very bones.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）的尸体重重摔到地板上；整座塔楼都随着雷声而颤抖！裂缝从他的身体中蔓延开来，你心生一种恶心的感觉，明白这个地方即将坍塌。当另一次震颤摇动巢穴时，一个裂缝裂开，让一道紫光射入，如此刺眼和强烈，你担心它可能会腐蚀你骨头上的肉。",
	"That light... It seems to inch towards Halaster as if it were magma or the tide itself. It swamps over his body, almost like a mother scooping up its wounded child. Instinctively, you leap at the corpse but it's too late—the light has taken him into the radiant depths below and closed off its womb. And although he is very much dead, you can hear his posthumous cries, as if he were being punished by that very same mother.": "那道光...它似乎像岩浆或潮水一样朝哈拉斯特(Halaster)靠近。它淹没了他的身体，几乎像母亲抱起受伤的孩子一样。本能地，你扑向尸体，但为时已晚——光已将他带入了下方辐射的深渊，并关闭了它的子宫。尽管他已经死了，你仍能听到他的遗言，仿佛他正在受到同一位母亲的惩罚。",

Certainly its metal was unknown even to the Melairkyn dwarves of old.": "你并不确定自己在看什么。毫无疑问，这是某种容器——一个盘形容器，顶部覆盖着玻璃圆顶。钢铁铰链揭示出圆顶是容器唯一的入口。所有这一切都被擦拭得光亮如新，如此干净，以至于你不确定应该用什么样的色彩形容词来描述它。毫无疑问，它的金属甚至连古老的梅莱尔金矮人都不知道。",
	"Circling the vessel, you inspect its underside. Strange doo-dads line the surface. The vessel is propped up on three legs. You feel sick, knowing this thing to be unnatural... yet so advanced it leaves you feeling inferior, even insignificant.": "围绕着船体，你检查它的底部。奇怪的小玩意儿排列在表面。这艘船被支撑在三条腿上。你感到恶心，知道这个东西是不自然的……但是如此先进，让你感到自卑，甚至微不足道。",

	"The ending to a campaign is a heavy burden for any Dungeon Master. After such a length journey, your party will hunger for a brief but satisfying epilogue. It has to be personal; it has to tie up loose ends; and it must put to rest any mysteries—or provoke them.": "对于任何地牢主持人来说，结束一场冒险是一个沉重的负担。在经历了如此漫长的旅程之后，你的队伍会渴望一个简短但令人满意的结局。它必须是个人化的；必须解决一切未解之谜；并且必须让任何神秘得到解答——或者引发更多疑问。",
	"Leaving Undermountain, as the adventurers find, is not so easy. They have languished here for so long, the Knot in the Weave has left its maddening touch in their minds and bones. Some among them may have fallen prey to the same addiction that plagued the Melairkyn dwarves, the Seven, and, of course, the Mad Mage himself.

	"A character that fails the Intelligence saving throw feels panic bloom within their mind—an invisible dread that animals must feel when they can sense a storm or earthquake.": "一个未能通过智力豁免检定的角色会感到恐慌在他们的脑海中蔓延开来——就像动物在能感知到暴风雨或地震时所感受到的无形恐惧一样。",
	"A character that fails the Charisma saving throw feels helpless against this invisible tyrant and buckles under its regime.": "一个未能通过魅力豁免检定的角色感到无助地面对这位隐形的暴君，并屈服于其统治之下。",
	"A character that fails two of three saves gains the following flaw: \"Undermountain is my lair, my home, my prize. I cannot leave it.\" Tailor that to fit a character's personality; for example, a dutiful character's flaw would likely sound like, \"If I were to leave Undermountain, there is no guaranteeing who will inherit the Mad Mage's arsenal.

Alternatively, \"the Mad Priest\" or the \"The Mad Beast\" would work for clerics and druids, respectively. \"Mad\" anything, really. \"Mad King, Mad Sovereign,\" et cetera.": "如果落入{@variantrule Weave Addiction|WDMMC}的角色是一名奥术施法者，务必称呼他们为“疯狂法师”。对于牧师和德鲁伊，可以使用“疯狂牧师”或“疯狂野兽”。实际上，任何“疯狂”的称号都可以，比如“疯狂国王，疯狂君主”等等。",
	"As described in WDMM, the fate of Undermountain is left up to you. It is worth petitioning your players to see what they want to do with Undermountain—and their lives in general.

	"The roof is coming down; you can sense it. The Mad Mage has left one last trap for you and it's time to bail. You can hear his snide laughter in your very bones as blood roars in your ears. The tower is collapsing and there is no more time to dilly nor dally. Like {@condition frightened} beasts, you flee from this reckoning.": "屋顶快要倒塌了；你能感觉到。疯狂法师为你留下了最后一个陷阱，现在是逃跑的时候了。你可以听到他讥讽的笑声在你的骨头里回荡，鲜血在你耳边咆哮。塔楼正在倒塌，再也没有时间磨磨蹭蹭了。像{@condition frightened}一样的野兽，你逃离这场审判。",
	"Amidst your flight, your mind begins to drift. You've done the impossible. You've slain the Mad Mage, one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful mage, in the world. You have triumphed where so many others have failed... And there was a look in Halaster's eyes when he died. You haven't been able to shake it from your memory. You fooled yourself into believing it was madness, or some indecipherable emotion, but you've known the truth: it was pride. {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} was proud of you. The dungeon master of Undermountain went to his grave proud of you.": "在你的飞行中，你的思绪开始飘散。你做到了不可能的事情。你杀死了疯狂法师，世界上最强大的，如果不是最强大的法师之一。你取得了胜利，而其他许多人都失败了……当哈拉斯特去世时，他的眼中有一种表情。你无法将它从记忆中抹去。你欺骗自己，认为那是疯狂，或者是一种无法解释的情感，但你知道真相：那是骄傲。{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} 为你感到骄傲。地下山的地下城主在去世时为你感到骄傲。",

He has perished before, but this time... this time Jhesiyra Kestellharp was ready.": "从来没有地下山这么寂静。它破败的房间变得漆黑，一度热闹的大厅里再也听不到笑声。疯狂法师又一次消失了。他以前曾经死过，但这一次……这一次杰西拉·凯斯特尔哈普已经准备好了。",
	"One by one the gates fell. One by one had Halaster's grip, desperate at best, been undone, his phantom fingers uncurled from the hilt of Undermountain's very soul. Although she could already hear him reforming—his essence kindling in the crucible below—he was powerless to stop her. His cries came out like distant groans from deep within the earth. He was watching. Good.": "一个接一个的大门倒下了。一个接一个的哈拉斯特的控制，充其量是拼命的，被解除了，他的幻影之手从安德矿山的灵魂之柄上展开。尽管她已经能听到他在下方的坩埚中重组——他的本质在燃烧，但他无力阻止她。他的哭声像来自地底深处的遥远呻吟。他在看着。很好。",
	"A breeze slipped through the ruined remains of Halaster's lair, slowly turning into a frail woman whose smile was just as sharp and cruel as a knife. She had played them like fools—all of them. Her schemes had at last born fruit. She reminded herself of their names; of what they sacrificed to depose her master. She would always be grateful. And she would be sure to show her gratitude should they ever dare descend into Undermountain again.": "一阵微风穿过哈拉斯特的巢穴的废墟，慢慢变成了一个虚弱的女人，她的微笑就像一把锋利而残忍的刀。她像傻瓜一样玩弄了他们——所有人。她的阴谋终于结出了果实。她提醒自己他们的名字；他们为推翻她的主人所做的牺牲。她会永远感激他们。如果他们再敢下到地下城，她会确保表达感激之情。",
	"With a wave of her hand, a marble throne materialized before her in the remains of {@creature Arcturia|WDMM|Arcturia's} court. She climbed the steps, savoring each one. In due time, she would erect her own tower in that void below, but for now, she would reign from here.": "她挥了挥手，一个大理石宝座在{@creature Arcturia|WDMM|Arcturia's}法庭的遗迹中凭空出现。她一步步登上宝座，每一步都体味着其中的滋味。在不久的将来，她将在下方的虚空中建立自己的塔楼，但现在，她将在这里统治。",
	"Halaster was mewling again. Jhesiyra closed her eyes and willed his rebirth to end—as if she were snuffing out a candle. He fought her; to his credit, he fought her even then, weak as he was. Even at his lowest, her master knew how to unravel her defenses and strike deep into her heart. If only she still had one.": "哈拉斯特（Halaster）又开始啼哭了。杰西拉（Jhesiyra）闭上眼睛，心中祈祷他的重生能够结束——就像她在熄灭蜡烛一样。他与她抗衡；值得称赞的是，即使在虚弱的状态下，他也与她对抗。即使在最低谷，她的主人也知道如何解开她的防御，并深深地打击她的内心。但愿她还拥有一个内心。",
	"She pressed her will on the flame, ignoring its fetal rage and the burns it left upon her. With an apocalyptic cry, the Mad Mage was no more. And as Jhesiyra Kestellharp now surveyed her new kingdom, a soft giggle exploded from her chest—a maniacal giggle that shared all the lunacy that graced her grin and her mad eyes.": "她强加自己的意志于火焰之上，无视它胎儿般的愤怒和留在她身上的灼伤。随着一声启示般的呐喊，疯狂法师不复存在。当杰西拉·凯斯特尔哈普（Jhesiyra Kestellharp）现在审视她的新王国时，一阵轻快的笑声从她的胸膛中爆发出来——这是一个疯狂的笑声，分享了她那张疯狂的笑容和疯狂眼神所具有的所有疯狂。",

	"You'll notice that a {@item bag of holding} is not on these lists and a {@item portable hole} doesn't appear until Level 20—and for good reason. Negating carrying capacity severely trivializes the need to periodically return to the surface and ensures that the party will strip Undermountain of all its loot without difficulty.": "你会注意到这些清单上没有{@item bag of holding}，而且{@item portable hole}直到20级才出现—这是有充分理由的。消除负重能力严重降低了定期返回地表的必要性，并确保队伍可以轻松地剥夺安德矿山的所有战利品。",

Narrated By Halaster Blackcloak (Yes, That One)!|dnd-font}\" The disembodied voice of the Mad Mage himself bounces off the walls, commanding you to get in the minecart.": "在符合当地语言习惯的情况下，文本中像(%num%)这样的内容在翻译中仍应输出为(%num%)。\n\n- 翻译遵循dnd running group规则，专有名词在翻译后应保留英文的 `()`。\n\n字眼在你头顶上爆发出现：「{@style The Terminus Tour!

	"After that last bit, the mine tracks retract, rolling up like a carpet. Thereafter, the tunnel gets bricked up right before their eyes.

	"It has been days since you left the Deep Mines and they have been spent in darkness—until at last you have come upon the most curious sight: a neatly carved stairwell descending below. You know it in your hearts that this is your next trial, that the Mad Mage would've righted your course if it was indeed wrong. Carefully, you descend the spiral staircase, wary for traps. By when you reach the grand foyer below, you encounter none. Pillars support a vast chamber curiously lit by torches whose flickering flames point upside-down. You find a statue of a young {@creature knight|MM}. The plague reads {@style Lady Dezmyr Shadowdusk|dnd-font}. Below that, another line reads \"{@style May She Deliver Us To The Promised Land.|dnd-font}\"": "自从你离开深矿已经过去了几天，这几天都在黑暗中度过——直到最后，你发现了一个奇特的景象：一个整齐雕刻的楼梯向下延伸。你们心里明白，这是你们的下一个考验，如果错了，疯狂法师也会纠正你们的方向。小心翼翼地下降螺旋楼梯，警惕着陷阱。当你抵达下面的大厅时，你并没有遇到任何陷阱。柱子支撑着一个巨大的大厅，由火炬奇特地照亮，火焰颠倒地指向上方。你发现了一个年轻{@creature knight|MM}的雕像。瘟疫上写着{@style Lady Dezmyr Shadowdusk|dnd-font}。在下面，另一行写着\"{@style May She Deliver Us To The Promised Land.|dnd-font}\"",
	"You come upon what can only be history: a fresco fifteen by thirty feet long. A robed wizard stands before a black portal, cradling a tablet fashioned from black crystal—as if it were a newborn babe. He's smiling. His eyes are cracked with a lifetime of smiles. He shares that warm smile with the portal—a lightless rift from which serrated tentacles slither. Your eyes fall on the plague below: \"{@style The Legacy Of Xerrion|dnd-font},\" it reads... and below that: \"{@style We Will One Day Join Him In The Promised Land|dnd-font}.\"": "你发现了一幅只能是历史的壁画：一个身着长袍的巫师站在一个黑色门户前，抱着一个由黑水晶制成的碑文——就像它是一个新生婴儿一样。他在微笑着。他的眼睛裂开了，充满了一生的笑容。他把那温暖的微笑与门户分享——一个无光的裂缝，从中蜿蜒而出的是锯齿状的触手。你的眼睛落在下方的瘟疫上：“{@style The Legacy Of Xerrion|dnd-font}”，上面写着……下面写着：“{@style We Will One Day Join Him In The Promised Land|dnd-font}”。",
	"A force from behind blows you into the corridor just as the floor begins to slide forward, animated by underlain magic. The walls are soon painted with an illusion that spells out the words, \"{@style Next Objective: Defeat The Elite Four!|dnd-font}\"": "身后的力量将你推向走廊，就在地板开始向前滑动之时，由地下魔法激发的。墙壁很快被一种幻觉涂满，拼写出了词语“{@style Next Objective: Defeat The Elite Four!|dnd-font}”。",
	"Reckoning has come at last! With an air of triumph, you hurl open the doors to Halaster's innermost sanctum—and the world beyond it is a colosseum infested with fans that buck and cheer under a sky painted with an illusion reading {@style Enter The Arena!|dnd-font}": "报应终于到来了！满怀胜利的气氛下，你猛然推开哈拉斯特的内部圣所的大门——门外是一座充斥着喜爱者的巨大竞技场，在一个由幻觉绘制的天空下，他们欢呼雀跃，其中写着{@style Enter The Arena!|dnd-font}。",
	"Only one thing is for certain: you're not in Undermountain anymore. As if it heard your thoughts, you find a sign growing out of a mushroom; it reads, \"{@style Mad Wizard's Lair Ahead: You're Not In Undermountain Anymore!|dnd-font}\"": "只有一件事是确定的：你不再在地下山了。仿佛听到了你的想法，你发现一块标志从蘑菇上长出来；它上面写着，“{@style Mad Wizard's Lair Ahead: You're Not In Undermountain Anymore!|dnd-font}”。"
