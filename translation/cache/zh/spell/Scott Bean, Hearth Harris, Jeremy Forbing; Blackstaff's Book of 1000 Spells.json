	"In a just universe, the first Blackstaff would write this prolegomenon himself. Yet the gods' fix most of their attentions on the firmament of creation. The stars remain in their courses, and the greater part of worldly justice is a task they leave to us. So, to my sorrow, composing this tome's introduction falls to me.": "在一个公正的宇宙中，第一位黑杖本应该亲自撰写这篇序言。然而，众神将大部分注意力集中在创世界的苍穹上。星星仍在它们的轨道上运行，世间正义的很大一部分任务是留给我们的。因此，令我悲伤的是，撰写这本著作的引言落在了我身上。",
	"Khelben Arunsun, better known as the first Blackstaff of Waterdeep, was an archmage unlike any other in the annals of the Realms. In terms of his complex service to the city he loved, his importance to its security and politics without any desire for worldly rulership, and his astonishing preparations to pass on his legacy, the man stands unique.": "凯尔本·阿伦桑（Khelben Arunsun）, 更为人熟知的是水深渊的第一任黑杖（Blackstaff）, 是一个在诸神领域中独一无二的大法师。在他对所热爱的城市的复杂服务、对城市安全和政治的重要性以及对传承遗产的惊人准备方面，这个人独一无二。",
	"He was also a good friend. The enormity of his loss cannot yet be reckoned in words.": "他也是一个好朋友。他的损失之巨大还无法用言语来衡量。",
	"Of further note is the depth of the Blackstaff's commitment to advancing the practice of the Art, which he pursued by some novel methods. One example is the tome ye now bear in hand.": "值得一提的是黑杖对推动（the Art）实践的执着程度，他通过一些新颖的方法来追求这一目标。一个例子就是你现在手中拿着的（the tome）。（Blackstaff）",
	"Khelben allowed copies of some of his most expansive compilations to circulate widely among other mages, which was rare enough. Yet each copy also bore a subtle and robust enchantment. Knowing well the tendency of mages to scrawl notes around the margins of their grimoires, by his magic he caused any note written in one copy of this spellbook to be copied into all the others (though only visible by further Art) and to appear, translated, in the native language of any reader.": "凯尔本（Khelben）允许他一些最广泛的编译品在其他法师中广泛传播，这本身就很罕见。然而，每一份副本也带有微妙而强大的魔法。他深知法师们喜欢在魔法书边缘涂鸦笔记的倾向，因此他的魔法使得任何一份这本咒语书中写下的笔记都会复制到其他所有副本中（尽管只有通过进一步的艺术才能看到），并且会以任何读者的母语出现，已翻译。",
	"\"By this dweomer— so carefully laid I did not detect it for years—he thus surveyed the age's great magical minds, sometimes in conversation with one another. It opened a window into the thinking of foes and allies alike, revealing new perspectives he often used in teaching of his apprentices. For those who uncover these hidden observations (which few do without a hint or two), these remarks carry great interest.": "通过这个（dweomer）- 我如此小心地布置，以至于多年来我都没有察觉到- 他这样审视了时代伟大的魔法大师，有时彼此交谈。它打开了一扇窗户，让他窥视敌人和盟友的思维，揭示了新的观点，他经常在教导学徒时使用。对于那些发现这些隐藏观察的人（没有一两个提示很少有人能做到），这些言论具有极大的兴趣。",
	"The incomparable Lady Laeral, Open Lord of Waterdeep, has consulted with me in choosing one of these volumes to be copied in much greater numbers and presented as a comprehensive canon of spells for students of the Art. Serving the study of spellcasting is not our sole motive in this. We see having this grimoire used and treasured by scores of mages, in this world and others beyond, as a fitting tribute to the Blackstaff, a living legacy of the work he began.": "无与伦比的女士莱拉尔(Lady Laeral)，水深之都的开明领主，已经与我商议，选择其中一卷作为范本，将其复制成更多份，并呈现为魔法学生的全面法术经典。我们的目的不仅仅是为了服务于魔法研究，我们希望看到这本魔法书被众多法师使用和珍藏，在这个世界以及其他更远的地方，作为对黑杖(Blackstaff)的恰当致敬，是他开始的工作的活生生的遗产。",
	"So take heed, ye students of magic: the present volume contains a prodigious collection of arcana, including all the hundreds of spells previously presented in my own recent Guide to Magic, along with twice so many new ones. Also included are notes left by some of the most powerful bearers of their own copies of this tome, from rulers of great city-states and planar travellers of great fame to loathesome lich-lords and even lowly sages of Shadowdale...": "所以，魔法的学徒们要注意了：这本书包含了大量的奥秘，包括我最近的《魔法指南》中介绍的数百种咒语，以及两倍多的新咒语。还包括一些最强大的持有此书副本的人留下的笔记，从伟大城邦的统治者和名声显赫的位面旅行者到可憎的巫妖领主，甚至是Shadowdale的卑微贤者...",
	"Have a care in consulting this grimoire. Not every spell here will suit ye in thy adventures. Wise mentors will pick and choose which should be available to younger mages. Some have been thoroughly researched and tested, whereas others are experimental and may require modification. It will suit ye well to be cautious in deciding which of these dweomers to use.": "在查阅这本（grimoire）时要小心。这里的每个咒语并不都适合你在冒险中使用。明智的导师会挑选出适合年轻法师使用的咒语。有些经过深入研究和测试，而另一些是实验性的，可能需要修改。在决定使用哪些（dweomers）时要小心谨慎，这会对你有所帮助。",
	"As a final warning, Khelben's enchantment still holds, so be very mindful of what private thoughts ye record in a personal copy; it is unlikely they will remain private for long!": "作为最后的警告，凯尔本的魔法仍然有效，因此在个人副本中记录私人想法时要非常小心；它们不太可能会保持私密很久！",
	"The spells in this grimoire supplement those in the {@i Player's Handbook} or the {@i D&D Basic Rules}. Per the spell lists below, the spells described in these pages can be cast by many classes. After each spell, its school of magic is listed in parentheses, as is whether it can be cast as a ritual. Descriptions of each spell start on page 23, and the Index starting on page 319 lists a page number for each spell.": "这本魔法书中的咒语是{@i Player's Handbook}或{@i D&D Basic Rules}中的补充。根据下面的咒语列表，这些页面描述的咒语可以被许多职业施放。在每个咒语之后，它的魔法学派将用括号标出，以及它是否可以作为仪式施放。每个咒语的描述从第23页开始，索引从第319页开始，列出了每个咒语的页码。",
	"Even D&D veterans often don't realize that spell levels are not mere game terms. According to canonical sources for the various settings, wizards and other spellcasters in the worlds of the D&D multiverse actually use the term \"level\" in reference to different tiers of spells and the varying amounts of energy required to cast them.": "即使是D&D老手也常常没有意识到，法术等级并不仅仅是游戏术语。根据各种设定的权威来源，D&D多元宇宙中的巫师和其他施法者实际上将术语“等级”用于指代不同层次的法术以及施放它们所需的能量量的差异。",
	"For example, if a rule says that a government or other authority in one of these worlds has a law requiring allm ages of 5th or higher to join a certain group, pass tests, or swear oaths of loyalty, those who enforce those rules actually keep track of whether a character can cast 3rd-level spells, since measuring spells by their level is a common practice. So feel free to have your character speak of {@spell raise dead} as a spell of 5th level, or suggest an ally cast {@spell magic missile} as a higher-level spell; these terms are part of how experts on magic use discuss the Art of spellcasting.": "例如，如果一个规则说，在这些世界中，政府或其他当局有一项法律，要求所有5级或更高级别的年龄加入某个特定团体，通过测试，或宣誓效忠，那些执行这些规则的人实际上会跟踪角色是否能施放3级法术，因为按照法术等级来衡量法术是一种常见做法。所以请随意让你的角色将{@spell raise dead}称为5级法术，或建议盟友将{@spell magic missile}作为更高级别的法术施放；这些术语是魔法专家讨论施法艺术的一部分。",
	"{@homebrew The following section is a 20-pages long list of class spell lists. I, as the converter, am making the executive decision to omit the list here.

	"Though Khelben 'BlackStaff' Arunsun spent so many of his years in Waterdeep, this grimoire includes spells from many worlds, useful across the multiverse. The utility of spells in different planes is a phenomenon I addressed recently in a treatise drafted certain newer apprentices.": "尽管凯尔本·“黑杖”阿伦森(Khelben 'BlackStaff' Arunsun)在沃特德普度过了许多年，这本魔法书包含了来自许多世界的法术，在多元宇宙中非常有用。法术在不同位面的实用性是我最近在一篇论文中讨论的，这篇论文是为某些新手学徒起草的。",
	"All spell effects draw upon the magical energies which underlie the substance of reality itself. The raw stuff of magic, however, is not sufficient to enable actual spellcasting. By means of incantation, precise gestures, and the right materials, adepts access an existing metaphysical structure, which conveys eldritch energies in response to proper casting.": "所有法术效果都依赖于构成现实本质的魔法能量。然而，魔法的原始物质并不足以实现真正的施法。通过咒语、精确的手势和正确的材料，(adepts)（擅长者）可以访问一个现有的形而上结构，这个结构会在适当的施法时传递神秘的能量。",
	"The mages of Abeir-Toril (the world known to some as \"the Forgotten Realms\") name that structure as the Weave. In other planes, that title is seldom used (though I hear more mages from elsewhere employing it of late, likely due to the wide distribution Faerûnian arcane literature). Yet in every place where spellcasting functions in a way we would recognize, some similar structure exists.": "在阿贝尔-托瑞尔（有些人称之为“被遗忘的国度”）的法师们将那个结构称为魔网。在其他位面，很少使用这个称号（尽管我最近听说来自其他地方的法师们越来越多地使用它，可能是由于费伦的奥术文献广泛传播）。然而，在每一个法术施放的地方，都存在一些类似的结构，我们会认出它们。",
	"In many worlds, the structure of magic is strongly identified with lines of power crossing the land. In others, it is directly connected with celestial objects (in one such world, a trio of moons fuels arcane casting, while divine casters tap into the favor of their gods via the stars). Rumors speak of worlds where magic is directly tied to the cycle of life itself, and of places where the mere act of casting a spell may have destructive effects, either on the nearby landscape or on the user's own mind.": "在许多世界中，魔法的结构与横跨大地的能量线紧密相连。在其他世界中，魔法直接与天体相连（在其中一个世界中，三颗月亮为奥术施法提供能量，而神圣施法者通过星星获得神明的青睐）。传言中有一些世界，魔法直接与生命循环相联系，也有一些地方，施放法术的行为可能对附近的景观或使用者的心智产生破坏性影响。",
	"The magical structures of different worlds disperse ambient energies at varying levels. In the world of Eberron, magic seems to suffuse every object. The world's underlying web of eldritch power is accessed by an unusally large portion of the mortal population (despite having many more spellcasters, however, the number of mages capable of casting spells higher than 3rd-level is very low). Eberron's oldest myths speak of three \"Progenitor Dragons,\" one of whom was slain and then became a great ring which can be seen in the sky, or possibly became the local expanse of the Astral Plane (the legends are contradictory and unclear). It may be the remaining energies of this 'dragon,' Siberys, which radiate magic throughout Eberron and all its adjoining planes.": "不同世界的魔法结构以不同水平散发环境能量。在(Eberron)的世界中，魔法似乎渗透到每一个物体中。这个世界潜在的奥术力量网络被异常大比例的凡人所接触（然而，尽管有更多的咒术师，但能施放高于3级法术的法师数量非常少）。(Eberron)最古老的神话讲述了三条“始祖龙”，其中一条被杀死后变成了一枚巨大的戒指，可以在天空中看到，或者可能成为了当地的星界平面（传说矛盾且不清楚）。也许是这条“龙”——西贝瑞斯（Siberys）的剩余能量在(Eberron)及其所有相邻的位面中辐射出魔法。",
	"Thankfully, such magical structures are similar enough in different planes (perhaps by divine design?) that most of the same spellcasting techniques seem to function across the known multiverse. Thus, mages in many worlds cast the spells of my peers from the Circle of Eight (including such well-known names as Bigby, Tenser, Otiluke, and Drawmij), while over the years, Elminster and I have both excersized some degree of our normal power in the domain of Barovia.": "值得庆幸的是，在不同位面中，这些神奇结构相似到足以让大多数相同的施法技巧在已知的多元宇宙中都能发挥作用（也许是神圣设计的？）。因此，许多世界的法师们施放着来自八圈（包括像比格比（Bigby）、坦瑟（Tenser）、奥提卢克（Otiluke）和德罗米（Drawmij）这样著名的名字）的法术，多年来，厄尔明斯特（Elminster）和我都在巴洛维亚领域行使了我们正常力量的一定程度。",
	"This remains true in the Inner and Outer planes as well. In Outer Planes such as Mechanus, Limbo, the NIne Hells, or the Seaven Hevens, these structures were clearly created by deities for their own use and that of their servants. In the Inner Planes, such as the Astral Plane, the Elemental Planes, and the Feywild, these structures seem to have emerged spontaneously, and they are less rigid and efficient, diffusing magical energies everywhere.": "这一点在内外位面也是如此。在外位面，比如机械位面、混沌位面、九层地狱，或七重天，这些结构显然是由神灵为了自己和仆人的使用而创造的。在内位面，比如星界、元素位面和精灵界，这些结构似乎是自发出现的，它们不那么严谨高效，将魔法能量随处扩散。",
	"Whether a spell is \"arcane\" or \"divine,\" the caster channels the same ambient magic. In general, the differences are matter of how one begins. To employ a metaphor, there are many ways to build a campfire, one might employ flint and steel, rub sticks together, use an existing torch, pour lamp oil on wood, et cetera. However you start a campfire, once lit, it is still the burning of firewood that provides the desired heat and light": "无论一个法术是“奥术”还是“神圣”，施法者都在引导相同的环境魔法。一般来说，区别在于开始的方式。打个比方，搭建篝火有很多种方式，可以使用打火石和钢、擦拭木棍、使用现有的火把、往木头上倒灯油等等。无论你如何点燃篝火，一旦点燃，仍然是燃烧木柴提供所需的热量和光芒。",
	"Similarly, however a caster starts the process of gathering magic for their spell, the actual effect is always fueled by the Weave (or the equivalent structure for that plane).": "同样，然而无论施法者如何开始收集魔法来施放法术，实际效果总是由法术纹理（或该位面的等效结构）提供动力。",
	"There are many examples. Emotions become the lens by which a bard both perceives the Weave and focuses its power. A burst of the deity's power comes in answer to a divine caster's prayer to begin a spell (diminishing the god's might, but usually in a miniscule way, like a drop from an ocean; the faith of the worshippers can replenish it). This holy spark may come directly, by the sacred covenant of a paladin's oath, or through a druidic connection to the land, it ignites the same drawing of magic from the Weave.": "有许多例子。情感成为诗人感知魔网并聚焦其力量的透镜。神祇之力的爆发是对神圣施法者祈祷开始施法的回应（虽然会削弱神祇的力量，但通常只是微不足道的方式，如大海中的一滴；信徒的信仰可以补充它）。这圣洁的火花可能直接来自圣骑士誓言的神圣契约，或通过德鲁伊与大地的联系，它点燃了同样从魔网中汲取魔法的过程。",
	"Do not confuse the way deities directly grant their clerics spark of their own power to with the more complicated way an otherworldly patron provides magic for a warlock. A patron negotiates access to the energies of the {@i plane} to which that patron is connected—not the patron itself. A warlock's pact creates a direct conduit to the magical essence of such a plane. The patron is not the source, which is why certain less powerful entities (such as lower-ranking devils) can act as patrons to warlocks whose power may eventually exceed their own. Warlocks who make pacts with minor devils aren't using magic from one particular fiend; they literally wield the power of Hell itself.": "不要混淆神祇直接授予他们的牧师自身力量的方式与异界保护者为术士提供魔法的更复杂方式。保护者谈判获得对其连接的{@i plane}的能量的访问权限，而不是保护者本身。术士的契约创造了直接通道到这种位面的魔法本质。保护者并非源头，这就是为什么某些较弱的实体（如低级恶魔）可以作为术士的保护者，后者的力量最终可能超过它们自己的原因。与次级恶魔签订契约的术士并非使用来自某个特定恶魔的魔法；他们实际上掌握的是地狱本身的力量。",
	"Mordenkainen uses my homeworld as an example to discuss universal truths of magic, but glosses over many unique details. For instance, surely he knows that 10th-level spells were once cast in Faerûn? When the ancient archmages of Netheril abused such magic, Mystra, the goddess who is the Weave, cut spells higher than 9th level out of our reality. To this day, no mage, no matter their power, can cast such epic spells.": "莫登凯南(Mordenkainen)以我的家园作为讨论魔法的普遍真理的例子，但忽略了许多独特的细节。例如，他肯定知道在法罗(Faerûn)曾经施放过10级法术吧？当尼瑟里尔(Netheril)的古代大法师滥用这种魔法时，代表魔纹的女神米斯特拉(Mystra)将高于9级的法术从我们的现实中剔除。直至今日，无论魔法师的力量有多强大，都无法施放如此史诗般的法术。",
	"You can rob a creature of one of its inherent aptitudes and give that capability to an ally. Choose one ability score. One creature of your choice within range makes a saving throw with that ability score. On a failure, the target has disadvantage on checks and saving throws with the chosen ability score. In addition, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls using the chosen ability score, and deals only half damage with such attacks if they are weapon attacks.": "你可以剥夺一种生物的固有能力，并将该能力赋予盟友。选择一个能力值。你选择范围内的一只生物使用该能力值进行一次豁免检定。如果未通过检定，目标在使用该能力值进行检定和豁免检定时具有劣势。此外，目标在使用该能力值进行攻击检定时也具有劣势，如果是武器攻击，则只造成一半的伤害。",
	"When you cast this spell, choose another willing creature within 30 feet. For the duration, that creature gains advantage on all ability checks and saving throws with the ability score you chose. In addition, that creature gains 25 temporary hit points.": "当你施放这个法术时，请选择另一个距离30英尺内愿意的生物。在持续时间内，该生物在你选择的能力分数上的所有能力检定和豁免 throws 上获得优势。此外，该生物获得25点临时生命值。",
	"At the end of each of the first target's turns, it can make a saving throw against the spell. It makes the saving throw with the ability score you chose, but the disadvantage inflicted by this spell does not affect saving throws against it. On a successful save, the spell ends.": "在第一个目标的每个回合结束时，它可以进行一次对抗法术的豁免投掷。它使用你选择的能力分数进行豁免投掷，但这个法术造成的劣势不会影响对抗它的豁免投掷。如果成功豁免，法术结束。",
	"You touch one suit of armor, which hardens with an extra layer of protection against attacks. The armor gains temporary hit points equal to {@dice 1d4} + your spellcasting ability modifier. While the armor still has these temporary hit points, its wearer has resistance to all damage except psychic damage. Each time the wearer takes damage that is not psychic damage, the same amount of damage is dealt to the armor's hit points.": "你触摸一套盔甲，它会增加一层额外的保护，抵御攻击。该盔甲获得临时生命值，数值等同于{@dice 1d4} + 你的施法能力调整值。当盔甲仍然拥有这些临时生命值时，穿戴者对除了精神伤害之外的所有伤害具有抗性。每当穿戴者受到非精神伤害时，同样数量的伤害也会造成给盔甲的生命值。",
	"The spell ends early if the temporary hit points are depleted, if the armor is doffed, or if the spell is cast again on the same suit of armor. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.": "如果临时生命值耗尽、卸下盔甲或再次施放在同一套盔甲上，该法术会提前结束。你也可以将该法术作为一个动作解除。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the temporary hit points increase by 5 for each slot level above 1st.": "当你使用2级或更高级别的法术位施放这个法术时，每个高出1级的法术位临时生命值增加5点。",
	"A burst of energy radiates from you in a 30-foot radius, dispelling shadowy foes and magical darkness alike. Creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or take {@damage 4d8} radiant damage. Creatures with vulnerability to radiant damage have disadvantage on this saving throw.": "一股能量从你身上散发出来，覆盖30英尺半径范围内，驱散阴影敌人和魔法黑暗。在你周围30英尺范围内的生物必须进行一次体质豁免才能，否则会受到{@damage 4d8}辐射伤害。对辐射伤害有易伤性的生物在这次豁免检定中有劣势。",
	"If the spell's area overlaps with an area of darkness created by another spell, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the other spell level. On a successful check, the other spell ends. Multiple magical darkness spells can be abolished in this way.": "如果法术的范围与另一个法术创造的黑暗区域重叠，使用你的施法能力进行一次能力检定。检定 DC 为 10 + 另一个法术的等级。在成功检定后，另一个法术结束。多个魔法黑暗法术可以通过这种方式废除。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radiant damage increases by {@dice 1d8} for each slot level above 3rd, and if the spell's area overlaps with one or more areas of darkness created by spells of 2nd level or lower, those spells end immediately.": "当你使用4级或更高级别的法术位施放此法术时，辐射伤害将每超过3级的位数增加{@dice 1d8}，如果该法术的范围与由2级或更低级别的法术创造的一个或多个黑暗区域重叠，那些法术立即结束。",
	"You touch a corpse that has been dead for less than 1 hour. While you are touching the corpse, you can attempt to draw out and view a memory that the corpse may possess. The corpse must have been alive to create the memory. Make an Intelligence check and add your proficiency bonus. If the result is a 20 or above, you can view the memory with perfect clarity. No one else can see or hear the memory. For the duration, you can use an action to repeat the roll, and try and view another memory. If you fail three consecutive rolls, you fall {@condition unconscious} for 1 hour.": "当你触摸一具死亡时间不超过1小时的尸体时，你可以尝试提取并查看尸体可能拥有的记忆。尸体在创造记忆时必须是活着的。进行一次智力检定并加上你的熟练加值。如果结果为20或以上，你可以完全清晰地查看这个记忆。没有人能看到或听到这个记忆。在持续时间内，你可以使用一个动作来重复投掷骰子，并尝试查看另一个记忆。如果你连续失败三次检定，你会陷入{@condition unconscious}状态，持续1小时。",
	"As a creature's spirit exits its body, you reach out and use its essence to make yourself more powerful. You gain 20 temporary hit points and the next spell you cast is cast as if it were one spell level higher. If the spell does not benefit from being cast with a higher spell level, then you only receive the temporary hit points. You must cast this spell during your next turn. The temporary hit points last until you finish your next long rest.": "当一个生物的灵魂离开它的身体时，你伸手并利用它的本质让自己变得更强大。你获得20点临时生命值，并且下一个你施放的法术将被视为比实际等级高一级的法术。如果这个法术不受从更高等级施放的影响，那么你只会获得临时生命值。你必须在接下来的回合内施放这个法术。这些临时生命值会持续直到你完成下一个长休。",
	"This spell creates an arcane ward that surrounds and protects you, harmlessly absorbing the energy of spells that target you to fuel your own casting. For the duration, you can use the ward as a reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and which does not have an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the ward.": "这个法术创造了一个神秘结界，环绕并保护着你，无害地吸收以你为目标的法术能量，用以增强你自己的施法。在持续时间内，你可以将这个结界用作反应来吸收只以你为目标且没有影响范围的法术。被吸收的法术效果被取消，法术的能量——而非法术本身——被储存在结界中。",
	"Once the ward absorbs a spell, you can use the captured spell energy, which has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The ward can absorb a number of spell levels equal to half your level + your spellcasting ability modifier. Once the ward absorbs that number of levels of spell energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the ward can't store, the ward has no effect on that spell. You always know how much spell energy your ward has absorbed and how many spell levels are currently stored within it.": "一旦结界吸收了一个法术，你可以使用被捕获的法术能量，其等级与施法时的法术相同。结界可以吸收的法术等级数量等于你一半的等级 + 你的施法能力调整值。一旦结界吸收了这么多等级的法术能量，它就无法再吸收更多了。如果你被一个结界无法存储的法术所瞄准，那么结界对该法术没有影响。你始终知道你的结界吸收了多少法术能量，以及目前存储在其中的法术等级数量。",
	"You can convert levels of spell energy stored in your ward to cast spells you have prepared or know, creating new spell slots from the stored energy rather than using slots of your own. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own highest-level spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels of spell energy in place of your own spell slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels of spells stored in the ward as a 3rd-level spell slot.": "你可以将存储在你结界中的法术能量水平转化为你已经准备或了解的法术，从存储的能量中创造新的法术位，而不是使用你自己的位。你只能创造等于或低于你自己最高等级法术位的法术位，最高可达5级。你使用存储的法术能量水平代替你自己的法术位，但其他方面施法方式与正常一样。例如，你可以将存储在结界中的3个法术水平用作3级法术位。",
	"Any spell levels remaining in the ward when the spell ends are lost.": "当法术结束时，护盾中剩余的法术等级将会消失。",
	"When you finish casting this spell, you light the incense and then touch one target creature to accelerate the vital energies within it. The target must begin a short rest within one minute, otherwise the spell. At the end of the short rest, the target regains the maximum number of hit points for each Hit Die spent. In addition, the recipient can make a saving throw for each poison or disease affecting it. On a successful save, the target recovers from that poison or disease.": "当你完成施放这个法术后，点燃香并接触一个目标生物，加速其体内的生命能量。目标必须在一分钟内开始短暂休息，否则法术无效。在短暂休息结束时，目标每消耗一个生命骰都会回复最大数量的生命值。此外，接受法术的目标可以为每一个影响它的毒素或疾病进行一次豁免投骰。若成功豁免，则目标从该毒素或疾病中康复。",
	"For the duration, it does not cost you extra movement to crawl, climb, squeeze, swim, or move across difficult terrain.": "在此期间，爬行、攀爬、挤压、游泳或穿越复杂地形时，不会额外消耗你的移动力。",
	"You conjure two watery globes of acid that appear in the air next to you. Both globes can target a single creature within range, or you can direct each to strike a different creature within range.

When you cast this spell, you create a magical trap tied to a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). While casting this spell, you physically trace the area of the surface or the outline of the object to be trapped.

Once a fang trap is triggered, this spell ends.": "当你施放这个法术时，你可以决定触发陷阱的方式。对于放置在表面上的牙齿陷阱，最典型的触发方式包括触摸或站在被设陷的表面上、移开覆盖表面的其他物体，或者靠近表面区域一定距离。对于刻在物体内部的牙齿陷阱，最常见的触发方式包括打开该物体、靠近该物体一定距离，或者以预先描述的方式操纵该物体。一旦牙齿陷阱被触发，这个法术就会结束。",
	"You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or according to whether or not the creature has immunity to poison damage or the {@condition poisoned} condition. Unlike a glyph of warding, it can't be made to activate on the basis of alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the fang trap, such as those who say a certain password. You are unable to trigger the fang trap yourself.": "你可以进一步调整触发器，使咒语只在特定情况下或根据身体特征（如身高或体重）、生物种类（例如，护符可以设定为影响畸变生物或黑暗精灵）或根据生物是否对毒害伤害或{@condition poisoned}状态免疫而激活。与护符符文不同的是，它不能根据阵营来激活。你还可以为不触发毒牙陷阱的生物设置条件，比如那些说出特定密码的生物。你无法自己触发毒牙陷阱。",
	"Any creature that sees you cast this spell knows the exact area affected, and immediately makes an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check against your spell save DC, gaining advantage on that check.

	"When the fang trap discharges, the object or surface grows huge fangs that immobilize the creature who triggered it. The creature is {@condition restrained} until the beginning of its next turn.

	"As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise, the spell fails.

You can use your bonus action this turn to force the target you hit to roll a Wisdom saving throw.

On a failure, until the spell ends, the target has disadvantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks, all spell attack rolls, and all saving throws against spells. For the same duration, all saving throws against spells cast by the target are made at advantage, and the symbol you inscribed on the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius around it.": "你用魔法在一只生物身上刻上了闪烁的符号，代表魔法女神Mystra，将其诅咒为该女神的愤怒。目标必须进行一次感知豁免。作为吟游诗人、术士、術士或法师（包括奥术杂耍者和秘术骑士）施法的生物在进行此豁免时处于劣势。如果未通过，直到法术结束，目标在所有智力、感知和魅力检定、所有法术攻击投掷和所有对抗法术的豁免中都处于劣势。在相同持续时间内，所有针对目标施放的法术豁免都具有优势，并且你在目标身上刻的符号会在其周围5英尺半径内发出微弱光芒。",
	"While a target is under the effects of this spell, each time it casts a spell of 1st-level or higher, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes damage equal to twice the spell's level. Whenever a creature with hair takes this damage, streaks of silver appear in its hair. If this damage reduces it to 0 hit points, the target's hair becomes completely silver.": "当目标受到这个法术影响时，每次它施放1级或更高级别的法术时，它必须进行一次体质豁免检定。如果失败，它会受到等于该法术等级两倍的伤害。每当一个有头发的生物受到这个伤害时，它的头发中会出现银色条纹。如果这个伤害将其降为0点生命值，目标的头发会完全变成银色。",

	"You create a number of false magical auras which blink in and out of the perceptions of any creature that can sense magic, moving from object to object as they do so. Choose a point within range. Within a 30-foot radius sphere centered on that point, any saving throw made against a divination spell is made with disadvantage, and the true magical (or nonmagical) natures creature or objects cannot be detected.

	"You focus on a location that you know about on the same plane of existence, gaining insight into the relative strength of creatures guarding the area and the amount of treasure stored there.

	"You create a whip made of psychic energy, which sparks pain but also fortifies will.

However, the next time that creature rolls a saving throw before the end of its next turn, it makes the saving throw with advantage.": "在咒语持续期间，除了正常使用鞭子作为武器外，你还可以将鞭子用于一个愿意的生物身上，作为一个奖励动作。当你这样做时，该生物会受到等于你的熟练加值加上你的法术属性调整值的心灵伤害，这个伤害不能被任何方式减少。然而，在该生物的下一个回合结束之前，如果该生物进行豁免投骰，它将获得优势。",
	"When you cast this spell using a 2nd or 3rd level slot, the damage is {@dice 3d4}. If the spell slot is 4th or 5th level, it's {@dice 4d4}.

	"You fill the bottle with water, and you enchant it to become crystal clear. Anyone who drinks the water during the duration is treated as if they were the target of a lesser restoration. The side effect is what gives the spell its name. Anyone that drinks the potion must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) or find everything hysterically funny. The character becomes {@condition prone} and {@condition incapacitated} for one round, laughing so loudly it is audible out to 50 feet.": "你用水装满瓶子，然后施加魔法使其变得晶莹剔透。在持续时间内饮用这瓶水的人会被视为次级恢复的目标。副作用是这个法术得名的原因。任何喝下这瓶药水的人必须进行一次感受法术豁免（DC 15），否则会觉得一切都异常滑稽。角色会在一回合内变成{@condition prone}和{@condition incapacitated}，笑声如此大声以至于在50英尺范围内都能听到。",
	"You touch a piece of ammunition and instantly make a weapon attack with it, just as if you were attacking with a weapon that is normally used to fire that type of ammunition.
