	"You grant a burst of swiftness to a creature of your choice that you can see within range. The target gains an additional action during its next turn, and its speed increases by 10 feet for the spell's duration. That action can't be used to take the {@action Attack} (except to {@action Shove} or {@action Grapple}), {@action Cast a Spell}, or {@action Ready} action.": "你为你能看到范围内的一个生物赋予一阵迅捷。目标在下一回合期间获得额外的一个动作，并且其速度在法术持续时间内增加10英尺。该动作不能用于进行{@action Attack}（除非是{@action Shove}或{@action Grapple}），{@action Cast a Spell}，或{@action Ready}动作。",

	"Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 2d8} necrotic damage and any damage it deals before the end of your next turn is reduced by {@damage 1d4}. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and its damage isn't reduced. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.": "一股死灵能量笼罩着你能看到的范围内的一只生物，从中抽取水分和生命力。目标必须进行一次体质豁免才能。未通过豁免的目标会受到{@damage 2d8}点死灵伤害，并且在你的下一个回合结束前造成的任何伤害都会减少{@damage 1d4}。通过豁免的生物会受到一半伤害，且其造成的伤害不会减少。这个法术对不死生物或者构装体无效。",
	"If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it. If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.": "如果你的目标是一只植物生物或者一个魔法植物，它将以劣势进行豁免检定，并且法术对其造成的伤害为最大值。如果你的目标是一个非魔法植物且不是生物，比如一棵树或灌木，它不需要进行豁免检定，它会简单地枯萎并死亡。",
