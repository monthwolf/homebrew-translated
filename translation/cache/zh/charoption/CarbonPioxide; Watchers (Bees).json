	"Something is always watching you and draws ethereal spirits that take the form of bees made of shadowstuff that follow you and gather in your general vicinity. These creatures act like normal examples of their kind, but their behaviour suggests a hint of malice. No matter what precautions you take, you can't permanently drive these spirits away. They always return, wait just beyond the reach of deterrents, or later crawl out of your clothes and equipment.": "总有一些东西在观察着你，并吸引了以暗影物质制成的蜜蜂形态的虚幻精灵跟随你并聚集在你周围。这些生物表现得像它们种族的正常例子，但它们的行为暗示着一丝恶意。无论你采取什么预防措施，你都无法永久地驱赶这些精灵。它们总是会返回，等待在威慑措施的范围之外，或者稍后从你的衣物和装备中爬出来。",
	"As an action, you can influence the presence guiding the watchers for 1 hour. For the duration, you gain advantage on Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) and Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks, and you can't be {@condition blinded}. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.": "作为一个动作，你可以影响引导守望者的存在1小时。在持续时间内，你在智力检定中获得优势（{@skill Investigation}），在感知检定中获得优势（{@skill Perception}），并且你不能被{@condition blinded}。一旦你使用了这个特性，你必须完成一次长休才能再次使用它。",
	"You have disadvantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}), Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}), and Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) checks made against creatures that can see the watchers, and you have disadvantage on saving throws made against the {@spell scrying} spell.": "当与可以看到观察者的生物进行敏捷检定({@skill Stealth})、感知检定({@skill Animal Handling})和魅力检定({@skill Persuasion})时，你将处于劣势状态，并且对抗{@spell scrying}法术的豁免检定也会受到劣势。",
	"You can temporarily disperse or hide the watchers with some effort. With 1 minute of work and a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) check (no disadvantage), you can suppress your Borrowed Eyes and Dread Presence for 1 hour. Once you successfully suppress these features, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.": "你可以通过一些努力暂时驱散或隐藏守望者。花费1分钟的时间并成功通过一次DC 15的感知检定（无劣势），你可以压制你的Borrowed Eyes和Dread Presence特征1小时。一旦你成功压制了这些特征，直到你完成一次长休之前都不能再这样做。"
