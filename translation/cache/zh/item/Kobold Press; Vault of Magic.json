This effect doesn't prevent the quill from being used as a standard quill on a nonmagical piece of parchment, but this written communication is one-way, from quill to parchment.

On a failure, a creature takes {@damage 3d6} bludgeoning damage and is knocked {@condition prone} and {@condition restrained} under the log.

Over time, Ventu grew increasingly paranoid, and his actions became more and more bizarre. Eventually, he decided that even his own Mage Hunters had become tainted by prolonged contact with the very magic that they were tasked to destroy. He summoned his most loyal soldiers and ordered them to round up and murder the Mage Hunters. For the Mage Hunters, it was the final straw. Many fled the kingdom in fear, but a few banded together and stormed Ventu's fortress. They killed the mad zealot then looked on his lifeless body in shocked disbelief. The Mage Hunters were appalled at what they had done, but they were even more appalled at what had transpired in the kingdom.

	"If the potion restores hit points beyond your hit point maximum, you must immediately succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 10 + the number of hit points over your hit point maximum) or develop a mutation.

Once the staff has been used to ask a corpse 5 questions, it can't be used to extract knowledge from that same corpse again until 3 days have passed.": "作为一个动作，你可以触摸法杖的头部到一具尸体上。在这个动作的过程中，你必须在心中形成一个问题。如果尸体有答案，它会向你透露信息。答案总是简洁的——不超过一句话——并且非常具体于所提出的问题。尸体不需要嘴巴来回答；你会通过心灵感应收到信息。尸体只知道它生前知道的事情，并且如果你对它敌对或者它认出你是敌人，它没有义务提供真实的答案。这个特性不会让生物的灵魂回到它的身体里，只是让它的激发精神回来。因此，尸体无法获得新信息，也无法理解自死后发生的事情，也无法推测未来事件。一旦法杖被用来向一具尸体提出5个问题，就不能再次用它从同一个尸体中提取知识，直到过去了3天。",

The next morning, he awoke to find a pair of mysterious, black boots on the floor next to his bed. Teegum smiled, knowing at once his prayers had been answered!": "在一次这样的场合中，提古姆（Teegum）这位极具智慧的地精盗贼，向恶作剧之神祈祷，希望能够完成一次完美的抢劫。第二天早上，他醒来发现床边有一双神秘的黑色靴子。提古姆微笑着，立刻知道他的祈祷得到了回应！",
	"That very night, the gnome successfully burglarized the royal treasury vaults of Orpesh. Over the next few months, he committed many more crimes, each seemingly more extravagant and daring than the last—heists that would live on in legend and song. Teegum stole the crown jewels of Ipn-tha; he replaced the golden eggs of the Holy Eagle of Bol with exact replicas then sold the originals for a fabulous sum; he strolled undetected into a secret meeting of the great banking consortium of Dalthoon and left with the contents of each member's coin purse. No trap could stop him! Before long, he was fabulously wealthy and had earned quite a reputation.": "那个晚上，侏儒成功地入侵了奥尔佩什(Orpesh)的皇家宝库。在接下来的几个月里，他犯下了更多的罪行，每一次看似比上一次更为夸张和大胆——这些盗窃行为将被流传成传奇和歌谣。蒂古姆(Teegum)偷走了伊普恩萨(Ipn-tha)的皇冠珠宝；他用精确的复制品替换了波尔圣鹰(Holy Eagle of Bol)的金蛋，然后将原件以巨额价格出售；他悄无声息地走进了达尔松(Dalthoon)大银行财团的秘密会议，并带走了每位成员的钱袋内容。没有任何陷阱能阻止他！不久之后，他变得富有无比，并赢得了相当的声誉。",
	"Unfortunately, there was one important lesson Teegum, like many criminals, con men, and tricksters needed to learn the hard way. Luck is a two-way street and the gods of deceit also play tricks on their worshippers. It was a lesson the gnome learned late one rainy, ale-soaked night at the point of a poisoned dagger. Grasping frantically at the burning wound in his gut, the last thing Teegum saw before his eyes closed forever was a dagger-wielding thief pulling off his magic boots and running into the dreary night.": "不幸的是，正如许多罪犯、骗子和骗子一样，提格姆(Teegum)需要以艰难的方式学到一个重要的教训。运气是一条双向街道，欺诈之神也会对他们的信徒玩弄把戏。这是一个侏儒在一个雨夜、酒精浸泡的夜晚在一把毒刀的威胁下才学到的教训。在他拼命抓住肚子里灼烧的伤口时，提格姆最后看到的东西是一个持刀的窃贼脱下他的魔法靴子，跑进了阴沉的夜晚，然后他的眼睛永远地闭上了。",

Uthariel's greatest assets were her great cunning and charm, and she used these to orchestrate alliances, eliminate rivals, and ensure outcomes that benefited her and her crown. Yet, with each new alliance or conquest, the young queen grew more uneasy. She was convinced an assassin or plot to dethrone her lay around every corner, and she prayed to the gods in hopes they might keep her safe. In response, they enchanted her royal diadem with great protective powers. Uthariel rejoiced, feeling suddenly invincible.": "由于年龄原因，乌萨瑞尔(Uthariel)担心会有人想夺走她的权力。她知道自己需要动用所有的资源和技能来确保自己保持权力。乌萨瑞尔最大的优势是她的狡诈和魅力，她利用这些来策划联盟、消灭对手，并确保结果符合她和她的王冠的利益。然而，随着每一个新的联盟或征服，年轻女王变得越来越不安。她深信刺客或阴谋围绕在每一个角落，她祈祷神灵能保佑她平安。作为回应，他们用强大的保护力量施加了魔法在她的皇家王冠上。乌萨瑞尔欢欣鼓舞，突然感到无敌。",

	"Perhaps the greatest mystery is what became of Talvin's original book, bound and written by Talvin's own hand.

While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the {@action Dash} action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.

	"To ensure their survival, the werewolf leaders reluctantly agreed to bury their hatred for one another and the two diminished packs became one.

	"For a time, the joined pack existed peacefully, and their combined might allowed them to rule the forest once again. However, the werewolf who possessed the magical horn grew disenchanted. He felt that his gift, the wolf 's howl ring, was far greater than the horn he had been given.

	"Your mind clouds over, enraged and feverish. You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and you deal an extra 2 damage of the weapon's type when you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength.
