	"The Corrupted Tarot is a deck like no other—the illustrations are based on interpretations of the classic Rider-Waite-Smith cards when they appear reversed. As such, knowledge of the traditional meanings of the cards will be beneficial.": "腐化塔罗（The Corrupted Tarot）是一副独一无二的牌组——插图基于对经典莱德-怀特-史密斯（Rider-Waite-Smith）牌的逆位解释。因此，了解牌的传统含义将会很有帮助。",
	"The Major Arcana contains the most archetypal cards in Tarot. if the Minor Arcana speaks to our daily lives and the struggles we face achieving our various goals or coping with our problems, the Major Arcana—the trump cards—are like the constellations in the sky, or the gods and goddesses that fill the pantheons of the world. Like the cycle of a myth, the Major Arcana takes us on a journey that has no true beginning or end, told through the eyes of the Fool.": "主牌组包含塔罗牌中最具原型特征的牌。如果小牌组反映了我们日常生活中面临的挑战以及努力实现各种目标或应对问题，那么主牌组——王牌——就像天空中的星座，或者填满世界诸神的众神。就像神话的循环一样，主牌组带领我们踏上一段没有真正开端或结束的旅程，通过愚者的眼睛讲述。",
	"In the Corrupted Tarot, the Major Arcana cards have been reversed and their darker natures revealed, but it's important to remember that, like any fairy tale or constellation or myth, this story is still meant to help us navigate out of the darkness... our guides may just be a little frightening.": "在《(Corrupted Tarot)堕落塔罗牌》中，(Major Arcana)主要牌被颠倒，它们更加暗黑的本质被揭示，但重要的是要记住，就像任何童话故事、星座或神话一样，这个故事仍旨在帮助我们走出黑暗...我们的向导可能只是有点可怕。",
	"The suit of Wands is commonly the most difficult to qualify. Like fire itself, the Wands are wild and elusive, mesmerizing, dangerous, yet life-sustaining. This is the journey on which all adventurers inevitably find themselves. Threads of creativity, passion and perseverance run throughout this suit. If you have ever made a decision that wasn't based strictly on logic, stepped outside your front door knowing you were safer within, or fought to preserve that which you created—your passions and your dreams—then this is the suit for you.": "权杖牌通常是最难解释的。就像火一样，权杖是狂野而难以捉摸的，迷人的，危险的，但又维系生命。这是所有冒险者不可避免地会经历的旅程。创造力、激情和毅力贯穿整个这副牌。如果你曾经做过不完全基于逻辑的决定，走出家门明知在家更安全，或者为了保护你所创造的东西——你的激情和梦想而战斗过，那么这副牌适合你。",
	"Traditionally, the Wands tell the story of how a spark of inspiration becomes a grand undertaking. Although the way is long and difficult, these moments along the path are bright. But when the Suit of Wands is corrupted, we're suddenly plunged into a much more difficult world to navigate. Where the traditional Wands marked a difficult path, the Corrupted Wands offer no path at all. This is the suit of fairy tales... old ones. Witches wait to test and deceive. Will-o-wisps tempt us in a thousand directions. The warm fire, once sustaining, is now cold, captivating, and dangerous. In this reversed suit you'll meet languishing kings and lost travelers. They have strayed far and lost their way in the brambles—but will you? Should you? ": "传统上，权杖牌讲述了一个灵感如何变成一个宏伟事业的故事。虽然道路漫长而艰难，但沿途的这些时刻是明亮的。但当权杖牌被腐化时，我们突然陷入了一个更加难以驾驭的世界。传统的权杖牌标志着一条艰难的道路，而腐化的权杖牌根本没有路径可循。这是童话故事的套牌...古老的故事。女巫们等待着考验和欺骗。燃烧的篝火曾经是滋养的，现在却变得冰冷、迷人且危险。在这个逆位的套牌中，你会遇到消沉的国王和迷失的旅行者。他们已经迷失在荆棘中，但你会吗？你应该吗？",
	"Themes of love, compassion, empathy and sorrow define the iconic suit of Cups. This is the domain of the element of water, and in a traditional tarot deck the orientation of the cups—whether they appear upright or knocked over—could change the symbolic meaning of the cards. The Cups suit contains some of the most joyous cards in the deck, and relationships of all kinds are represented here.": "爱、同情、同理心和悲伤的主题定义了传奇的圣杯套牌。这是水元素的领域，在传统塔罗牌中，圣杯的方向——无论是正立还是倾斜——都可能改变牌的象征意义。圣杯套牌包含了牌堆中一些最快乐的牌，各种关系都在这里得到了代表。",
	"Corrupted, these strong ties between loved ones all but disappear. To explore the reversals of the Cups cards is to dive into a world of emotional isolation, where every individual stands alone. The realm of the Fae is reflected strongly in our corrupted Cups: capricious, cruel, and cold-hearted, these predatory creatures feel deeply and wildly, yet cannot connect with each other. Blood replaces water in the goblets, hinting at the terrible price we pay when we give up that which makes us most human.": "腐化，这些深厚的亲情纽带几乎消失殆尽。探索圣杯牌的逆位意味着深入一个充满情感孤立的世界，每个个体都独立站立。精灵王国在我们腐化的圣杯中得到了强烈的反映：反复无常、残忍、冷酷，这些掠食性生物感受深刻而狂野，却无法彼此连接。血液取代了杯中的水，暗示了当我们放弃使我们最具人性的东西时所付出的可怕代价。",
	"In the traditional Tarot, the cycle of Swords contains some of the darkest cards in the deck; the Swords suit represents the intellect. Because the nature of Tarot is to help us understand human nature (including ourselves), the Swords we have here aren't really meant to kill monsters or slay our enemies. They are double-edged, each capable of hurting the wielder as keenly as their opponent; this is the nature of the mind.": "在传统塔罗牌中，剑牌的周期包含了牌组中一些最黑暗的牌；剑牌代表着智力。因为塔罗的本质是帮助我们理解人性（包括自己），这里的剑牌并不是用来杀死怪物或杀死敌人的。它们是双刃剑，每一把都能像对手一样刺痛使用者；这就是思维的本质。",
	"Your own mind is the most potent enemy you may ever face. As such, the suit of Swords has themes of anxiety, treachery, anguish, hopelessness, conceit and doubt... but it also contains some of the most beautiful blessings. Inspiration, rationality, justice and forgiveness all call the suit of Swords home.": "你自己的心灵可能是你所面对的最强大的敌人。因此，剑牌具有焦虑、背叛、痛苦、绝望、自负和怀疑的主题...但它也包含一些最美丽的祝福。灵感、理性、正义和宽恕都属于剑牌。",
	"In the Corrupted Suit of Swords, the darkness is closing in more tightly than ever before. In this tangled world, the rational mind is beset on all sides. Blades that should be whole are jagged and shattered. Minds that should be calm are twisted and bestial. Here, in the darkest part of the forest, every man has a wolf inside of him; looking into the mirror takes more courage here—what will look back at us? What are the worst parts of ourselves, that which we are desperate to avoid? To survive the Swords' cycle in this story it's not enough to know ourselves. We must save ourselves, and pull those blades out with our own hands.": "在腐化剑装中，黑暗比以往任何时候都更加紧密地包围着我们。在这个纷乱的世界中，理性的思维四面受敌。本应完整的刀剑却是参差不齐、支离破碎。本应平静的心灵却扭曲而野蛮。在这片森林中最黑暗的地方，每个人内心都有只狼；在这里凝视镜中需要更多的勇气——会有什么回望我们？我们内心最糟糕的部分是什么，那些我们拼命想要避免的东西？在这个故事中，要在剑装的循环中生存，仅仅了解自己是不够的。我们必须拯救自己，并亲手拔出那些刀剑。",
	"The suit of Pentacles, also called Coins, is the domain of not only labor and hard work, but also attendance to our connection with the earth. The suit of Swords may focus on the mind, the Cups the heart, and the Wands the spirit, but the Pentacles connect us with our own bodies and teach us how to thrive in the world around us. Wealth, comfort, sensuality and building a lasting legacy for ourselves and our families: this is the wisdom that the Pentacles suit has to offer.": "五角套牌，也称为金币，不仅代表劳动和辛勤工作的领域，还关乎我们与大地的联系。剑牌可能聚焦于思维，圣杯关乎心灵，权杖代表精神，而五角牌则让我们与自己的身体联系起来，教导我们如何在周围的世界中茁壮成长。财富、舒适、感性和为自己及家人建立持久遗产：这就是五角套牌所能提供的智慧。",
	"But what happens when this wisdom is corrupted? Reversed, these cards tell a much darker story. When we lose touch with the earth, the earth itself becomes unrecognizable. Instead of golden crops, we reap dessicated and rotten fruit. When we can't work together, our monuments crumble and break, along with our very bodies. In the Corrupted Tarot, the Pentacles instead tell the story of our connection to the Underworld... and our quest to escape it.": "但是当这份智慧被扭曲时会发生什么呢？这些牌逆转后，讲述的是一个更加黑暗的故事。当我们与大地失去联系时，大地本身变得面目全非。我们不再收获金色的庄稼，而是收割干枯腐烂的水果。当我们无法共同努力时，我们的纪念碑会崩塌破碎，连同我们自己的身体一起。在《(Corrupted Tarot)腐化塔罗牌》中，(Pentacles)金币牌代替地讲述了我们与冥界的联系...以及我们努力逃离的故事。",
	"The liquid contained here is held greedily by the fae. A sense of entitlement, parsimony, and indulgence prevails. The blood is their own, symbolising complete self-sufficiency. This card represents energies flowing inward, self-sustainment, isolation from the outside world, and a focus on feelings buried deep within.": "这里所含的液体被(fae)贪婪地保留着。一种自以为是、吝啬和放纵的感觉盛行。这血液是他们自己的，象征着完全的自给自足。这张牌代表着能量向内流动，自我维持，与外界隔离，以及专注于深藏在内心深处的感情。",
	"The traditional Ace of Cups is usually depicted as an overflowing cup with five streams (the senses), and represents love, deep feelings, compassion, new connections, and energies flowing outward.": "传统的圣杯王牌通常被描绘为一个溢出的杯子，带有五条流（感官），代表着爱、深情、同情心、新的联系以及能量向外流动。",
	"Opportunity denied or postponed. This may be a poor time to make investments or take risks. You find yourself reaching for new opportunities, only to watch them slip through your fingers.": "机会被拒绝或推迟。现在可能不是投资或冒险的好时机。你发现自己正在寻找新的机会，却看着它们从指间溜走。",
	"As Pentacles represent the element of earth and the material realm, the Ace represents new beginnings. Rather han a barred gate or a tangled path, the traditional Ace is an open door: a fresh opportunity for luck and abundance.": "作为代表土元素和物质领域的金币牌，Ace代表着新的开始。传统上，Ace不是一扇关闭的大门或一条错综复杂的道路，而是一扇敞开的门：一次新的幸运和丰盛的机会。",
	"A mysterious hand controls a sword as the instrument of chaos, destroying everything around it. Your thoughts are scattered and impulsive, your ideas not yet fully formed. Go carefully forward; the potential for damage is great.": "一只神秘的手控制着一把剑，作为混乱的工具，摧毁周围的一切。你的思绪散乱而冲动，你的想法尚未完全形成。小心前行；潜在的破坏性很大。",
	"The shattered crown is meant to be whole, symbolizing dominion and surety of judgement. Far from a warning about confusion, this card is a herald of new wisdom and fresh ideas. Your thoughts are clear and swift. You are blessed with an illuminating insight.": "破碎的皇冠本应完整，象征着统治和判断的确定。这张牌并非警示混乱，而是新智慧和新思想的先驱。你的想法清晰而迅速。你被赋予了启发性的洞察力。",
	"The corrupted Ace indicates that you may be distracted by exciting, new ideas, trying to do everything at once. As a result, no decisions get made, nothing gets finished and ideas with great potential fizzle out, unrealized.": "被腐化的愚者表示你可能会被令人兴奋的新想法分散注意力，试图一次做所有事情。结果是，没有做出任何决定，没有完成任何事情，具有巨大潜力的想法会未能实现而消失。",
	"The Ace of Wands is meant to represent the seed of a new endeavor, a moment of creativity and willpower. This is the genesis of a new project, a new dream, the spark of something that will grow to be great. ": "权杖之王代表着一个新事业的种子，一个创造力和意志力的时刻。这是一个新项目的起源，一个新梦想，一种将会成长为伟大的火花。",
	"Nothing can stop Death. However we twist its meaning or reason with its timing, it cannot be delayed forever. Here we see Death as an inscrutable, captivating companion. You are unprepared to let go of something leaning away and resisting change, but no matter how long you linger or bargain, Death will always be more patient.": "没有什么能阻止死亡。无论我们如何扭曲它的含义或理由，无论我们如何控制它的时机，死亡都无法永远延迟。在这里，我们将死亡视为一个深不可测、迷人的伴侣。你可能没有准备好放手，可能在逃避和抗拒改变，但无论你逗留多久或讨价还价多少，死亡始终比你更有耐心。",
	"Because the Tarot tells a cyclical story of endings and beginnings, Death is one of the most misunderstood cards in the deck. Although it is frightening, the traditional Death card represents growth and evolution. Like a caterpillar losing its form within a chrysalis, you are undergoing great transformation. You cannot go back. The old version of yourself and your old life are being shed to make way for a stronger, wiser person.": "由于塔罗牌讲述了一个关于结束和开始的循环故事，死神是牌组中最被误解的牌之一。尽管它令人恐惧，传统的死神牌代表着成长和进化。就像一只毛毛虫在蛹中失去形态一样，你正在经历巨大的转变。你无法回头。你旧有的自我和旧生活正在被抛弃，为更强大、更明智的人让路。",
	"The Eight of Cups is about sacrifice and courage. When it appears in this more daunting and negative way, it's an indication that you've become more lost than you know. You may be at an important crossroads, but the path that leads to emotional fulfillment is dark and perilous, full of sacrifices that you may not feel ready to make. A difficult decision must be made.": "八(8)杯代表着牺牲和勇气。当它以更具威胁和消极的方式出现时，这表明你已经比你所知道的更加迷失。你可能正处在一个重要的十字路口，但通往情感满足的道路是黑暗和危险的，充满了你可能还没有准备好做出的牺牲。必须做出一个艰难的决定。",
	"Dissatisfied with the course your life is taking, you may find yourself yearning to stray from the path and start anew. This is a time of transition and growth, but the upheaval can be very painful. Sometimes we must sacrifice what we've gained if it isn't truly making us happy.": "对于你的生活走向感到不满意，你可能会渴望偏离现有道路，开始新的生活。这是一个转变和成长的时期，但动荡可能会非常痛苦。有时候，如果得到的东西并没有真正让我们快乐，我们就必须做出牺牲。",
	"Resilience is demanded of you, far more than you may have prepared for or expected. Both the upright and reversed meanings behind the Eight of Pentacles point to a period of struggle and perhaps doubt. This particular Eight signals that your hard work may be taking a great toll on your body, and it is crucial to ask yourself if it is truly worth the cost.": "对你来说，韧性被要求得更多，远远超出你可能准备或期望的范围。八角硬币牌（Eight of Pentacles）正位和逆位的含义都指向一个困难和或许怀疑的时期。这张特定的八角硬币牌表明，你的辛勤工作可能对你的身体造成了巨大的负担，关键是要问问自己，这真的值得吗。",
	"The most difficult part of the path that the suit of Pentacles takes us on: you are as prepared for the task ahead as you can be, but to succeed you must block out all distractions and focus on your goal. The upcoming task will push you to work beyond what is merely acceptable. You have the chance here to distinguish yourself and create a masterpiece.": "在我们接受由财富牌组带领的旅程中，最困难的部分是：你已经为即将到来的任务做好了准备，但要成功，你必须屏蔽一切干扰，专注于目标。即将到来的任务将推动你超越仅仅可接受的标准。你在这里有机会脱颖而出，创造一件杰作。",
	"Feelings Of helplessness and entrapment are giving way as you come into your own. The woman in the Iron Maiden, like the traditional Tarot's blindfolded victim, was encased, unaware of her own power. Here we see her pry apart her own cage: though her hands are bloodied, she is in control of her fate once again, and has emerged into the light.": "当你开始找到自己的位置时，无助和困境的感觉正在消退。像传统塔罗牌中被蒙住眼睛的受害者一样，铁处女中的女人被困在里面，对自己的力量毫无察觉。在这里，我们看到她自己撬开了笼子：尽管她的手被鲜血染红，但她再次掌控了自己的命运，并走出了黑暗，迎向光明。",
	"Unfortunately it is the classic and upright Eight of Swords that warns us we are feeling out of control in our own lives. If you are likewise surrounded and penned-in, remember that this is not a literal cage: representing the intellect, the swords of the iron maiden—as well as the darkness within it—are strongest in your mind.": "不幸的是，正是经典而正直的剑八(%num%)在警告我们，我们感到在自己的生活中失控。如果你也感到四面楚歌，记住这不是一个字面上的囚笼：代表智慧，铁处女的剑——以及其中的黑暗——最强大的在你的头脑中。",
	"The Eight of Wands warns that you are being frozen, paralyzed by the fear of change. Everything here is defensive, reflected in the figure's posture and expression. Not only are you feeling trapped, but you are also stagnant and afraid; rather than fresh greenery, these wands now sprout deadly thorns.": "八支杖牌警告你正在被冻结，被对改变的恐惧所瘫痪。这里的一切都是防御性的，体现在人物的姿势和表情中。你不仅感到被困，而且停滞不前且害怕；这些杖现在长出了致命的荆棘，而不是新鲜的绿叶。",
	"Uncorrupted, the Eight of Wands still urges patience. This is a time for you when opportunities and change are coming very quickly. You must adapt and act, as soon as those opportunities are within your grasp. Be bold: positive change is coming.": "未被腐蚀，(%num%) 杖仍然敦促耐心。对你来说，现在是机遇和变化迅速到来的时候。当这些机会近在眼前时，你必须适应并行动。要勇敢：积极的变化即将到来。",
	"Inspired by the Hindu goddess Akhilandeshvari, also known as the broken goddess. She is in a constant state of flux, forming and reforming, she draws her power from being broken. She represents a choice, while laying in pieces on the floor, with no idea how to move forward. You are at your most powerful, you are changing, you are flowing in a new way, and this is an incredibly powerful opportunity to become a newer, better version of yourself.": "受印度教女神阿基兰德什瓦里(Akhilandeshvari)的启发，她也被称为破碎女神。她处于持续变化的状态中，不断形成和重塑，她的力量源自于破碎。她代表了一种选择，在地板上散落成碎片的同时，却不知道如何前行。你正处于最强大的状态，你正在改变，以一种新的方式流动，这是一个极其强大的机会，让你成为一个更新、更好的自己。",
	"The card of grief: here are depicted {@homebrew cups|cards} that are both toppled over and upright. Lost opportunity and missed chances spill out of the overturned cups. You may have lost someone dear to you, or are feeling that you time has been wasted. Do not dwell in the past, or lose sight of the things you have that are still standing.": "悲伤牌：这里描绘了{@homebrew cups|cards}既倒下又直立。失去的机会和错过的机会从倾倒的杯子中溢出。你可能失去了一个亲人，或者感觉自己的时间被浪费了。不要沉湎于过去，也不要失去对仍然屹立的事物的视野。",
	"A hopeful interpretation of the Five of Pentacles reversed: rather than a period of poverty and want, you are finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. However, this card can also warn us of spiritual poverty, our earthly needs may be well in hand, but like a desecrated and forgotten shrine, your deeper purpose and drive requires fresh devotion.": "五个金币（Five of Pentacles）逆位的一个充满希望的解释：与其说是贫困和匮乏的时期，不如说你终于看到了隧道尽头的光明。然而，这张牌也可能在警示我们精神上的贫困，我们的物质需求可能已经得到满足，但就像一个被亵渎和被遗忘的神龛一样，你更深层的目的和动力需要新的奉献。",
	"A beautiful but melancholy card, the traditional Five of Pentacles depicts crippled and destitute figures outside a glowing and inviting stained glass window. You, too, may feel very much left out in the cold to survive the world alone. Loneliness and the curses of bad luck hound you. But charity and companionship are not forever lost.": "一张美丽但忧郁的牌，传统的金币五(%num%)描绘了残疾和贫困的人物站在一个闪闪发光、诱人的彩色玻璃窗外。你也可能感到被冷落在一旁，独自在世界中求生存。孤独和厄运的诅咒缠绕着你。但慈善和伴侣并非永远失去。",
	"\"Oh bright night leave me to rest, amongst the thorns and sand and these crooked shadows of this lonely desert. For I have nothing left to give, and I am forsaken.\" So speaks the corrupted Five of Swords, a warning against prolonged conflict. You are nearing the end of your energy, and reckoning with the fruitlessness of war. This card appears when you are still in the trenches, long after a battle should have ended.": "\"哦，明亮的夜晚，让我休息吧，在这荆棘、沙漠和这孤独沙漠中扭曲的阴影中。 因为我已经没有什么可以给予的了，我被抛弃了。\" 如此说着被腐化的剑牌五(%num%)，这是对长期冲突的警告。 你的精力即将耗尽，正面对战争的徒劳无功。 当你仍然在战壕中，远超过一场战斗应该结束的时候，这张牌就会出现。",
	"When the classic Five of Swords appears, it indicates a lack of wisdom. You or someone important to you is not being a gracious winner: although a technical triumph, the victory is tainted by a lack of purpose or a prolonged, needless poisoning of relationships. Like all Swords, the Five urges us to think through our emotions, before we completely isolate ourselves.": "当经典的五剑出现时，它表示缺乏智慧。你或者对你重要的人并没有成为一个宽容的赢家：尽管在技术上取得了胜利，但这个胜利却因缺乏目的或长期不必要的破坏关系而被玷污。和所有的剑牌一样，五剑敦促我们在完全孤立自己之前，先好好思考我们的情绪。",
	"Frank Frazetta's \"Night Stalker\" offers us a glimpse into a lonely road and monstrous but isolated creature. Conflict waits in the future, inevitable and brutally necessary, but for now it's simply brewing. Although this card can offer congratulations on avoiding a fight with those closest to us, it also warns us to not stifle or run from conflict: keeping it locked inside can transform us into something terrible.": "Frank Frazetta的《夜行者》为我们展示了一条孤独的道路和一个孤立的怪物。冲突在未来等待，是不可避免的，也是残酷的必要，但现在只是在酝酿。虽然这张牌可以祝贺我们避免与最亲近的人发生争执，但它也警告我们不要扼杀或逃避冲突：将其锁在内心深处可能会使我们变成可怕的东西。",
	"Traditionally the Five of Wands show us five figures fighting, full of intensity. This is a moment of strain on relationships and great distraction, but those relationships will not be shattered. Conviction and wisdom will temper this moment of chaos and prepare you for the victories ahead.": "传统上，五支杖牌展示了五个人物激烈地争斗的场景。这是一段关系紧张、分心的时刻，但这些关系不会破裂。信念和智慧将调和这一混乱时刻，并为未来的胜利做好准备。",
	"Lingering indecisively beneath the tree has brought about the worst of possibilities. Three cups hang empty and the ephemeral fourth cup—once offered freely—is now used to take instead of give. However, hope arrives with the dawn. Golden threads remind us that life is both finite and valuable, and each new day is full of choices.": "徘徊在树下犹豫不决带来了最糟糕的可能性。三只杯子空空如也，那短暂的第四只杯子——曾经自由地奉献——现在却被用来索取而非给予。然而，希望随着黎明而来。金色的线索提醒我们，生命既有限又宝贵，每一个新的一天都充满选择。",
	"Apathy is the enemy of contentment. With this classic reading of the Four of Cups, you are lingering in a state of indecisiveness. Nothing satisfies, though many paths and options are available to you. This could be a time of seclusion and withdrawal, but be careful not to get lost in your own mind, or you may miss what is right in front of you.": "冷漠是满足的敌人。通过这个对(四杯牌)的经典解读，你正徘徊在犹豫不决的状态中。没有什么能满足你，尽管有许多路径和选择在你面前。这可能是一个孤立和退缩的时期，但要小心不要迷失在自己的思绪中，否则你可能会错过眼前的机会。",
	"Already a nuanced card, the corruption of Four of Pentacles is a much more dire warning about greed. The Hoarding Horror indicates that not only are you losing sight of spiritual fulfillment, but your hunger for materialistic gain can never be satisfied without a mindset shift; it is as harmful to you as it is isolating.": "作为一个细致入微的牌，四（Four）个金币（Pentacles）的腐化更加严重地警示贪婪。《囤积恐怖》（Hoarding Horror）表明，你不仅失去了对精神满足的追求，而且对物质利益的渴望在没有心态转变的情况下永远无法得到满足；这对你同样有害，也会让你变得孤立无援。",
	"Classically, the Four of Pentacles depicts a seated figure, ensconced in the beginnings of wealth and attaining—perhaps for the first time—a foothold in stability. There is a danger here of becoming greedy or covetous, but this can also be a time of marshalling resources, wise allocation, and satisfaction.": "传统上，财富四(%num%)描绘了一个坐着的人物，沉浸在财富的开端中，并且第一次获得了稳定的立足点。在这里存在着变得贪婪或嫉妒的危险，但这也可以是调动资源、明智分配和满足感的时刻。",
	"In the corrupted Four of Swords, you are seeking rest but find yourself tormented by your inner demons, towering over you like ancestors at your bedside. This card calls on us to make decisions about what we can and cannot handle. Your mind may need rest. Not everything is as dire as it appears.": "在被腐化的四剑中，你寻求休息，却发现自己被内心的恶魔折磨，如同祖先在你床边高耸。这张牌呼唤我们就我们能够处理和不能处理的事情做出决定。你的头脑可能需要休息。并非所有事情都像看起来那么可怕。",
	"A time of peace and recovery. The classic Four of Swords depicts a knight at rest, after sustaining wounds or being stretched too thin by exhaustion—the trials in the {@card Three of Swords|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT} that have now passed. A temporary retreat is necessary. You are freshly vulnerable and must marshal your strength and resources.": "一段和平与恢复的时光。经典的四剑牌描绘了一名骑士休息，经历了伤痕累累或因疲惫过度而筋疲力尽——{@card Three of Swords|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT}中的挑战现在已经过去。暂时的撤退是必要的。你现在处于脆弱状态，必须调动自己的力量和资源。(Four of Swords)",
	"You are transitioning to a new place or family, or traveling towards a goal, but the way may be treacherous and the outcome is ambiguous. The torches guide your way down a rocky, bramble-entangled path and the glowing house beckons you. Does help wait within, or is it a dangerous trap?": "你正在前往一个新的地方或家庭，或者朝着一个目标前进，但道路可能是危险的，结果是模棱两可的。火炬指引着你沿着崎岖、荆棘交织的小路前行，发光的房子招手示意着你。里面是否等待着帮助，还是这是一个危险的陷阱？",
	"Rather than a dark witch's house, the uncorrupted Four of Wands usually shows us a happy home, a safe haven full of celebration and rest. This is meant to signify gathering and respite, a time of reunion.": "与黑巫师之家相反，未被腐化的四支杖通常展示给我们一个快乐的家园，一个充满庆祝和休息的安全避风港。这意味着聚会和休息，是团聚的时刻。",
	"Judgement, meant to be a harrowing but crucial step on the querent's journey, has been corrupted here to represent an impassable, chaotic deluge. Your guilt is too strong, your responsibilities too heavy, and your heart too wounded by all the things for which you have not yet forgiven yourself.": "审判，本应是求问者旅程中令人恐惧但至关重要的一步，却在这里被扭曲成了代表无法逾越的混乱洪水。你的内疚太过强烈，责任太过沉重，你的内心被所有你尚未原谅自己的事情所伤害。",
	"When Judgement appears, it heralds a necessity for self-examination. You are being called upon to answer for what you've done. You may carry lingering guilt with you over something done. intentionally or not. in the past. You may know—deep down—that something in you remains unhealed. Be honest with yourself, and move forward to take your place in the world.": "当审判出现时，它预示着自我审视的必要性。你被召唤来回答你所做的事情。你可能会因为过去有意或无意地做过的事情而感到内疚。你可能心里清楚，有些东西在你身上仍未愈合。对自己诚实，继续前行，找到你在世界中的位置。",
	"When the corrupted Justice appears, her bloody sword and noose-like scales symbolize death: no matter the verdict, it always leads to a grim and terrible end. Despite her blindfold, Justice wears an ominous crown of eyes atop her head that stares at the viewer. This may warn of an upcoming injustice, but also suggests that facing the consequences of your actions is inevitable. You cannot hide from Justice.": "当腐败的正义出现时，她血腥的剑和像绞索般的天平象征着死亡：无论裁决如何，它总是导致一个阴暗可怕的结局。尽管她被蒙住双眼，正义却戴着一顶充满威胁的眼睛皇冠，盯着观者。这可能是对即将发生的不公正的警告，但也暗示着面对行为后果是不可避免的。你无法逃避正义。",
	"One of the most straightforward cards in the Tarot deck, classic Justice—depending on how guilty you may be feeling—can inspire either fear or hope. Justice's appearance heralds a time of vindication and revelations. Something done in the dark will soon be brought into the light.": "塔罗牌中最直接的牌之一，经典的正义（Justice）—取决于你是否感到内疚—可能会激发恐惧或希望。正义的出现预示着一个伸张正义和揭示真相的时期。在黑暗中做的事情很快就会被揭示出来。",
	"When the Corrupted King of Cups appears, a figure of great cruelty and opulence dominates your life. The King's body decays as he pays tribute to the gods with his blood, hoping to receive the gift of immortality in return. Supremely selfish and manipulative, the King's understanding of emotional depth has gifted him with the power to do great harm.": "当出现腐化的圣杯国王时，一个极其残忍和奢华的人物将主宰你的生活。这位国王的身体正在腐烂，他用自己的鲜血向神灵致敬，希望得到永生的礼物作为回报。极度自私和善于操纵，这位国王对情感深度的理解赋予了他造成巨大伤害的力量。",
	"No one is more in tune with their unconscious selves than the King of Cups. More than aware of his underlying emotions and motivations, he has become a master over them. It is only through this mastery that the King is able to live in true peace with himself, and thus he is able to be a just and effective authority figure.": "没有人比圣杯国王更能与他们的潜意识自我保持一致。他对自己潜在的情绪和动机了如指掌，已经成为了这些方面的大师。只有通过这种掌控，国王才能真正与自己和平相处，因此他才能成为一个公正而有效的权威人物。",
	"The corrupted King of Pentacles has learned all of the wrong lessons from his position. Rather than providing for his people and sharing the bounty of the earth, he hoards everything, letting it spoil and rot: his self-obsession tragically twists and defeats the intended purpose of his wealth.": "五角王牌(King of Pentacles)的堕落，他从自己的地位上学到了所有错误的教训。与其为人民提供帮助，分享大地的丰盛，他却囤积一切，任由它们腐烂: 他的自我执着悲剧性地扭曲并击败了他财富的本意。",
	"Great success in business, excellent management of resources, and hard work are all championed in the classic King of Pentacles. A subject could ask for no better king; under his rule the land flourishes and prosperity visits every home. Although the King can occasionally be a critical and demanding teacher, he has a genuine passion for sharing his experience and fortune.": "在经典的硬币之王(King of Pentacles)中，取得了巨大的商业成功，出色地管理资源，以及辛勤工作都备受推崇。一个主题不可能找到比他更好的国王；在他的统治下，土地繁荣昌盛，繁荣之神拜访每一个家庭。尽管这位国王偶尔可能是一个批判严厉、苛刻要求的导师，但他对分享自己的经验和财富有着真挚的热情。",
	"The corrupted King embodies everything dangerous about mastering the realm of the intellect. With no concern for the emotional health of his people, he has decayed into a brutally efficient tyrant and master manipulator. At his most dangerous, this is a figure who has learned to twist logic and truth to control the people around him.": "腐化的国王体现了掌握智力领域中所有危险的特质。他对人民的情感健康毫不关心，已经堕落成一个残忍高效的暴君和狡猾的操纵者。在最危险的时候，这个人物已经学会了扭曲逻辑和真相来控制周围的人。",
	"It is not enough to simply be intelligent or perceptive, if we wish to master the dominion of the suit of Swords. The King of Swords draws conclusions from what he observes and metes out justice, combining wisdom and wit. He considers the consequences of his actions and the effects they'll have on his people. Ethics and logic are equally important to the King.": "要掌握宝剑牌的统治权，仅仅聪明或敏锐是不够的。宝剑国王从观察中得出结论，施行公正，结合智慧和机智。他考虑自己行动的后果以及对人民的影响。伦理和逻辑对国王同样重要。",
	"A man paralyzed by inaction. Where there should be fire—a confident, magnetic leader—we instead find coals and sodden earth. Falling prey to doubt, the King sits in his overgrown throne room, mocked by the raven, his sole companion. Rather than blazing with purpose, this figure represents dormant potential. Fire burns only in his eyes. But it burns still, and the Raven may spur him to new action... context and position are key.": "一个因无所作为而瘫痪的男人。在那里本应是火焰——一个自信、有磁性的领袖——我们却发现的是余烬和湿润的土地。陷入怀疑的困境，国王坐在他那长满杂草的宝座房间里，被乌鸦嘲笑，他唯一的伴侣。这个形象代表的不是燃烧的目标，而是潜在的潜力。火焰只在他的眼中燃烧。但它依然燃烧，而乌鸦可能会激励他采取新的行动……背景和位置至关重要。",
	"Like all Kings, the King of Wands in his pure form embodies leadership. A trailblazer, he lights the way for others—he is unstoppable, a force of creativity and willpower. Whatever project the King starts, he finishes. To think of the King of Wands uncorrupted is to remember that creativity can never be truly extinguished.": "像所有国王一样，权杖国王在其纯粹形式中体现了领导力。作为一名开拓者，他为他人指明道路——他势不可挡，是创造力和意志力的象征。无论国王开始什么项目，他都会完成。想象未被腐化的权杖国王，就是要记住创造力永远不会真正熄灭。",
	"Rather than mastering emotion and intuition, our Knight of Cups has been washed away by it. The water is no longer within the Cup; the vessel has shattered in his hands, and his emotions cannot be contained, surrounding him in a disorienting, surreal flood. The Knight must repair what is broken and regain control of himself, before it's too late.": "与掌控情感和直觉不同，我们的圣杯骑士被它们冲走了。水不再在圣杯中；容器在他手中破碎，他的情绪无法控制，围绕着他形成令人困惑、超现实的洪水。骑士必须修复破碎的东西，重新掌控自己，以免为时已晚。",
	"Untroubled, the traditional Knight of Cups is a herald and messenger of an upcoming emotional upheaval, or the beginning of a new journey. In touch with his feelings and filled with faith in the direction that his heart is leading him, this Knight is unafraid to express his true passions, and often urges us to act with integrity when he appears in a reading.": "安详的，传统的圣杯骑士是一位即将到来的情感动荡的使者和信使，或者是一段新旅程的开始。他与自己的感情联系紧密，充满对内心引领他的方向的信念，这位骑士毫不畏惧地表达自己真实的激情，并常常在塔罗牌阅读中敦促我们要以正直行事。",
	"Burdened by either his need for material gain or his responsibilities, the corrupted Knight of Pentacles is a frustrated and stagnant messenger—one who cannot manage to break free from his own chains to bring his suit's gifts to the world. If you identify with the Knight, you do not lack motivation or ambition, but your daily routine has become a prison. Rejuvenation is possible, but you must reckon with the need for change.": "由于对物质利益或责任的需求，腐化的(骑士)Knight of Pentacles是一个受挫和停滞不前的使者——他无法摆脱自己的枷锁，将他的套装礼物带给世界。如果你认同这位(骑士)Knight，你并不缺乏动力或抱负，但你的日常生活已经变成了一种囚禁。重振是可能的，但你必须正视改变的需求。",
	"Rather than being suffocating, your routine and current course of action are preparing you for success when you see the traditional Knight of Pentacles appear. This is a direct and hard-working individual that champions diligence and responsibility. Failure is almost impossible if you continue your forward momentum.": "与其说你的日常和当前的行动让人感到窒息，不如说它们正在为你成功做准备，当你看到传统的(骑士)Knight of Pentacles出现时。这是一个直率而勤奋的个体，倡导勤勉和责任。如果你继续前进的势头，几乎不可能失败。",
	"Impatience and lack of direction, when coupled with inexperience, is a recipe for disaster, and can lead even the bravest Knight into calamity.": "缺乏耐心和方向感，再加上缺乏经验，是灾难的前兆，甚至会让最勇敢的骑士陷入困境。",
	"The Knight of Swords brings his ideas to his community as quickly as possible. Everything is done quickly and directly, and although his intentions are good, he is often dangerously brash and lacks foresight and wisdom. He teaches us, however, to be bold and to act on our ideas, permitting nothing to stop us.": "(剑骑士)迅速将他的想法带给社区。一切都是迅速而直接的，尽管他的意图是好的，但他常常过于性急，缺乏远见和智慧。然而，他教导我们要勇敢，要立即行动，不让任何事情阻止我们。",
	"Adventure corrupted, as courage and optimism turns into reckless frustration and impatience in the face of obstacles. Perhaps our corrupted knight was not mentally prepared to set out. Perhaps they are a ghost trapped in an endless loop, repeating the circumstances that led to their demise. In either case, their energy is misdirected. The way is not forward; movement has stalled.": "冒险变得腐化，因为勇气和乐观在面对障碍时变成了鲁莽的挫败和不耐烦。也许我们的腐化骑士并没有做好心理准备就出发。也许他们是一个被困在无尽循环中的幽灵，重复导致他们死亡的情况。无论哪种情况，他们的能量都被误导了。道路并非向前；前进已经停滞不前。",
	"The Knight of Wands, uninhibited by tangling thickets and mental pitfalls, is all energy, and his energy is going in one direction: forward. Nothing impedes this figure, though perhaps something should. The Knight's only vulnerability is lack of foresight.": "权杖骑士，不受纠缠的荆棘和心智陷阱的束缚，充满活力，他的能量只朝一个方向前进。没有任何东西能阻挡这个人物，尽管也许应该有些阻碍。骑士唯一的弱点是缺乏远见。",
	"Corrupted, this card shows us shining cups plummeting backward in a wild scatter. Hard-won but now lost, these cups once held the promise of emotional fulfillment.

Be careful to hold tight to and appreciate what you have, while you search for what still eludes you.": "腐化，这张牌展示了闪亮的杯子在狂乱的散落中向后坠落。曾经辛苦赢得但现在失去了，这些杯子曾经承载着情感满足的承诺。你的生活充满了祝福，但某种威胁着你所建立的稳定。在寻找仍然逃避你的东西的同时，要小心紧握并珍惜你所拥有的。",
	"The card of wish fulfillment: the traditional Nine of Cups, much like {@card Nine of Pentacles|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT}, appears in a reading when we are \"almost there\".

The cycle cannot end until the gifts you've won are shared.": "心愿达成的牌：传统的九杯牌，就像{@card Nine of Pentacles|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT}一样，在塔罗牌阅读中出现，意味着我们“快要成功了”。{@card Ten of Cups|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT|Ten}的满足和幸福就在眼前，酒杯们整齐地摆放着，但再次，人物是孤独的。这个循环直到你赢得的礼物被分享才能结束。",
	"The cost of surviving the {@card Eight of Pentacles|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT} is coming due in the Nine. The darker aspect of this card is the taste of ashes in our mouths after a costly victory: maybe you were not as successful as you hoped to be, or maybe the cost was simply too high. True rejuvenation is only possible after we acknowledge our emotional needs.": "在九中，生存的代价即将到期。这张牌的更阴暗一面是在一场代价高昂的胜利之后嘴里尝到灰烬的滋味：也许你并没有像希望的那样成功，或者代价只是太高了。真正的复苏只有在我们承认自己的情感需求之后才能实现。",
	"A bright, burgeoning garden of prosperity, the traditional Nine of Pentacles is a plateau of satisfaction and success compared to the corrupted reversal reading. Here we see a woman enjoying the fruits of her labor—but like in all Nines, her journey is still unfinished. She, like the bird, is far from home.": "繁荣昌盛的花园，传统的金币九(%num%)代表着满足和成功的高原，与堕落的逆位阅读形成鲜明对比。在这里，我们看到一个女人正在享受她劳动的成果——但就像所有的九一样，她的旅程还未结束。她和鸟一样，离家还很远。",
	"This vampire is paranoid enough to sleep with one eye open—and with good reason. The onlooker has stumbled into her lair.

	"If we remain caged in the {@card Eight of Swords|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT}, the Nine represents the grim sleepless nights that follow; paranoia and trauma hang above and around us.

It is time to reach out for help, and confront the true source of your fear.": "如果我们继续被困在{@card Eight of Swords|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT}中，九(%Nine%)代表着接踵而至的阴郁不眠之夜；偏执和创伤在我们头顶和周围徘徊。你可能被未解决的创伤、恐惧或内疚所困扰。头脑已经背叛了你，带来无尽的挑战。是时候寻求帮助，直面你恐惧的真正根源了。",
	"Absolute exhaustion is on the horizon, an every shred of willpower is required to move forward. This is not unique to the corrupted Nine of Wands, but here our energy is being drained too quickly, bringing a moment of great fear, where traditionally the subject is standing tall and persevering through the last trial.": "绝对的疲惫即将来临，每一丝意志力都需要用来继续前行。这并不是仅限于被腐化的九支杖(`Nine of Wands`)，但在这里我们的能量被消耗得太快，带来了一刻巨大的恐惧，在传统上，主体是挺立而坚持通过最后的考验。",
	"Instead of fear and a crisis of confidence, the classic meaning of the Nine of Wands inspires in us great hope. Traditionally, one more wand is drawn in hand, symbolizing one last challenge to come. We are exhausted but still standing.": "与恐惧和信心危机不同，(Nine of Wands)的经典含义激发了我们对未来的巨大希望。传统上，手中再拿起一根权杖，象征着即将到来的最后一次挑战。我们虽然筋疲力尽，但仍然屹立不倒。",
	"An individual with enormous potential is being stifled or warped in some way. Creativity without an outlet can lead to depression or the desire to escape from reality. Because the Page is sensitive and empathetic, this reversal is particularly heart-wrenching; they must find a way to communicate or explore their emotions.": "一个拥有巨大潜力的个体正在某种方式被扼杀或扭曲。没有出口的创造力可能会导致抑郁或渴望逃离现实。由于牌面(Page)敏感且富有同理心，这种逆转尤其令人心碎；他们必须找到一种方式来沟通或探索他们的情绪。",
	"The untroubled and innocent Page of Cups is blessed with fresh perspectives and vivaciousness: to this figure, life is an adventure, ripe with poignancy and creative inspiration.

	"Traditionally, only the chalice of the Queen of Cups is contained. The unknown contents are elaborately covered, guarded by small angels.

Does the chalice restrain her boiling, primordial rage? Her relentless, poisonous sorrows?": "传统上，只有圣杯女王的圣杯被装载着。未知的内容被精心覆盖，由小天使守护着。她对情感的控制被誉为一种美德，但即使表面平静闪闪发光，海洋也是危险的。如果内容被压抑以保护他人安全呢？圣杯是否约束了她沸腾的原始愤怒？她无情的、有毒的悲伤？",

	"The traditional Queen of Pentacles is, seemingly, exactly that: traditional. She often represents an idealization of the humble homemaker, and is intrinsically bound to the symbolism of the earth.

	"Traditionally older and far more experienced than the young corrupted Queen, this is a decisive and just leader. She strives to rule with her intellect, though she can come off as too emotionally cold or detached. The upright Queen of Swords cautions us to not let ourselves be completely swayed by our emotions.": "传统上，剑皇后((Queen of Swords))比年轻腐化的女王更年长且经验丰富。她是一位果断而公正的领袖。她努力用智慧统治，尽管她可能显得过于情感冷漠或超然。直立的剑皇后提醒我们不要让自己完全被情绪左右。",

Temperance represents a richer and more meaningful way to live.": "宁静：传统节制的呼唤。在这个时候，宁静和平衡至关重要。当逆境出现时，保持这种平衡至关重要；不要牺牲周围世界而沉溺于自我之中，也不要走向相反的极端。节制代表着一种更丰富、更有意义的生活方式。",
	"A broken home. Shattered relationships. Abundance has tipped over into decadence and overindulgence, and this has soured to poison, leading to familial strife and generational trauma.": "一个破碎的家庭。破裂的关系。丰富已经倾向于堕落和过度放纵，这已经变得酸臭成毒药，导致家庭冲突和代际创伤。",
	"An idyllic home, the Ten of Cups is the ultimate safe haven and marker of serenity and happiness. The loneliness of the {@card Nine of Cups|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT} has been resolved at the end of the cycle; beyond wish-fulfillment for oneself, the Ten represents a healthy and nurturing environment or the entire family or community.": "十杯牌是一个田园般的家园，是最终的安全港和宁静幸福的象征。在这个周期的尽头，{@card Nine of Cups|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT}的孤独已经得到解决；除了为自己实现愿望外，十杯代表着一个健康和培育环境，或者整个家庭或社区。",
	"A success that comes at the cost of all that truly matters. Sacrificing everything: family, friends, love—all for nothing. The destruction of personal legacy or reputation.": "以牺牲一切真正重要的事物为代价而获得的成功。为了毫无意义地牺牲一切：家庭、朋友、爱情。个人遗产或声誉的毁灭。",
	"The traditional Ten of Pentacles is as bright as the corrupted meaning is devastating. Here, instead of bitter ashes, we see great success bringing tru fulfillment and a lasting legacy. Your hard work has paid off and not only are you flourishing, but you are planting roots in your home life and community, bringing hope, stability and satisfaction to everyone you hold dear.": "传统的十个金币牌与堕落的含义一样明亮，但却是毁灭性的。在这里，我们看到巨大的成功带来真正的满足和持久的遗产，而不是苦涩的灰烬。你的辛勤工作得到了回报，你不仅蓬勃发展，而且正在为家庭生活和社区扎下根基，给你所珍视的每个人带来希望、稳定和满足。",
	"A sense Of dark finality comes every time the Ten of Swords appears in a reading, whether upright or reversed; there is no avoiding this crash into rock-bottom. Something catastrophic has happened: a great betrayal. But in this corrupted Ten we see the victim in the moment after; no longer prone and defeated, she takes the first steps towards recovery, pulling the swords out with her own hands.": "每当十剑(%num%)出现在塔罗牌阵中，无论正位还是逆位，都会带来一种黑暗的终极感。这是一次无法避免的坠入谷底。发生了灾难性的事件：一次巨大的背叛。但在这腐化的十剑(%num%)中，我们看到受害者在之后的瞬间；不再躺倒在地，她开始迈向康复的第一步，亲手拔出那些剑。",
	"One of the most dreaded cards in tarot, the traditional Ten of Swords shows us defeat. A figure lies prone, impaled through the back. The Suits of Swords draws this chilling conclusion: the intellect is the most dangerous tool we have, and if we are not careful it can destroy us. But hope comes to us even now like the {@card Death|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT} card, the Ten of Swords promises that rejuvenation after disaster is possible. ": "在塔罗牌中，最令人畏惧的牌之一，传统的剑十牌向我们展示了失败。一个人躺在地上，背部被刺穿。剑牌的套装得出了这个令人不安的结论：智力是我们拥有的最危险的工具，如果我们不小心，它会毁灭我们。但希望仍然如{@card Death|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT}牌般降临到我们，剑十牌承诺灾难之后的复苏是可能的。",
	"A jaded spirit abandons herself and the many endeavours she carries. The tasks once performed with passion are now snuffed out, never igniting a true blaze.

Recognize your true responsibilities, as well as what is only dragging you down.": "一颗厌倦的灵魂放弃了自己和她所承担的许多努力。曾经充满激情地完成的任务现在已经熄灭，从未点燃真正的火焰。十(10)支杖(Urge)我们放下一切不能丰富我们生活的事物。认清你真正的责任，以及那些只是拖累你的东西。",
	"The tragedy of the Ten of Wands cannot be avoided, but it can be mitigated by wisdom.

To keep your fire lit, you must learn to share it among others.": "十(10)(Ten) of Wands的悲剧是无法避免的，但可以通过智慧来减轻。成功的负担，实现我们的目标使我们处于权威和力量的位置，但我们很容易工作过度和不堪重负。为了保持你的激情，你必须学会与他人分享。",

	"Classically, the Chariot represents control over chaos. Like the Chariot driver themselves, you are in a position where expertise, assertiveness and intense focus are required for success. Merely being ambitious or strong-willed is not enough: the appearance of the Chariot promises us triumph but only if we strategize and execute our plan with confidence.": "传统上，战车代表对混沌的控制。就像战车驾驶员本身一样，你处于一个需要专业知识、果断和高度集中注意力的位置才能取得成功。仅仅有雄心壮志或意志坚定是不够的：战车的出现向我们承诺了胜利，但只有我们能够自信地制定和执行计划时才能实现。",
	"Self-reflection and shadow work: the inverse Devil is all about the inner self, rather than an external temptation. The figures here are both within us. At odds with each other, yet bound together, this signals an ongoing process that requires self care and self love.": "自我反思和阴影工作：逆恶魔关乎内在自我，而非外部诱惑。这里的人物都存在于我们内心。彼此对立，却又紧密相连，这预示着一个需要自我关怀和自我爱的持续过程。",
	"The Devil appears when we are feeling at our most powerless. This card represents irresistible temptation, and if it represents another person you are being warned of their intentions and their effect on your life. Addiction in some form is keeping you trapped, and the Devil's chains will need to be broken if you are to move forward.": "当我们感到最无助的时候，魔鬼就会出现。这张牌代表着无法抗拒的诱惑，如果它代表另一个人，那么你应该警惕他们的意图以及他们对你生活的影响。某种形式的瘾症让你陷入困境，如果你想要前进，就必须打破魔鬼的枷锁。",
	"A corrupt Emperor sits motionless as his dominion withers and burns behind him—perhaps he doesn't even see it, or is incapable of stopping its destruction. This is a figure unsuited to leadership: overbearing, rash, controlling yet apathetic. Nothing flourishes while he reigns. If the Emperor points to yourself in a reading, there may be some responsibility you are shirking.": "一位腐败的皇帝坐在那里一动不动，他的帝国在他身后枯萎和燃烧——也许他甚至没有看到，或者无法阻止它的毁灭。这是一个不适合领导的人物：专横、轻率、控制欲强却又冷漠。在他统治时期，没有什么会茂盛。如果在阅读中皇帝指向你自己，可能是你在逃避某些责任。",
	"The Emperor is a mythological father figure, at times overbearing and strict but primarily embodying protectiveness, discipline, and control. Although the Emperor is unconcerned with happiness or relying on intuition, he sees himself as a servant of his people and is often a highly effective and just leader.": "皇帝是一个神话般的父亲形象，有时候显得专横和严厉，但主要体现出保护性、纪律性和控制性。虽然皇帝不关心幸福或依赖直觉，但他视自己为人民的仆人，通常是一个高效和公正的领袖。",
	"Far from a paragon of fertility, love and growth, the corrupted Empress is cataclysmic and overbearing. She grows out of control like a weed, snuffing out everything around her instead of encouraging it to grow and stand on its own. Instead of life, she begins to embody the mercilessness of death itself.": "远非生育、爱与成长的典范，被腐化的女皇是灾难性且专横的。她像野草一样失控生长，扼杀周围的一切，而不是鼓励它们生长并独立站立。她开始体现死亡本身的无情，而非生命。",

A deep connection with the earth and nature connects the Empress with themes of fertility and abundance. including emotional fulfillment and joy.": "女皇应该体现出存在于我们所有人内心的典型女性原则。与大地和自然的深刻联系让女皇与生育和丰饶的主题联系在一起，包括情感满足和喜悦。",
	"The corrupted Fool is more than simply naive, he is wholly blind to the dangers that surround him. Here we see him dressed more classically as a harlequin; he risks ridicule with his inexperience, but the more sinister sight of blood hints at how threatening or deceptive he could actually be. In this more dangerous Tarot cycle, we do not have the luxury of learning slowly.": "腐化的愚者不仅仅是天真，他完全对围绕着他的危险视而不见。在这里，我们看到他更经典地打扮成一个小丑；他冒着因为缺乏经验而被嘲笑的风险，但更阴险的是血的景象暗示着他实际上可能是多么具有威胁性或欺骗性。在这个更危险的塔罗周期中，我们没有慢慢学习的奢侈。",
	"The Fool has no true personality yet: they are open to the universe, a complete blank slate. When we slip into the Tarot's cycle, we as the querent are represented by The Fool. We—and they—possess infinite potential.

	"Sacrifice, without any discernible reward or result. What once may have been altruistic or wise has become poisoned and dangerous: you will soon have nothing left to give, as your resources, energy and time drain away. Sometimes we pour ourselves into our work, and the fruits of our labor merely take a long time to grow, but now is a time to disengage and draw boundaries.": "牺牲，没有任何明显的回报或结果。曾经可能是无私或明智的行为现在变得有毒和危险：你很快将没有任何剩余的东西可以给予，因为你的资源、能量和时间正在流失。有时我们会全身心投入工作，而劳动的成果可能需要很长时间才能显现，但现在是时候脱离并划定界限了。",
	"The card of sacrifice. Not every achievement in life can be reached by a relentless ambition and upward mobility. Sometimes we arrive at crucial decisions that cannot be made rashly, and although they feel urgent, the Hanged Man advises us that delay and reflection might be the best course of action. Like Odin in the World Tree, you must give way and remain still, and insight will come to you. ": "献祭之牌。生活中并非所有成就都能通过不懈的野心和向上流动来实现。有时我们会面临关键决定，不能草率行事，尽管它们看似紧迫，但倒吊人（Hanged Man）告诫我们，延迟和反思可能是最佳选择。就像世界树上的奥丁，你必须让步保持静止，洞察力将会降临于你。",
	"The corrupted Hermit brings all-consuming anxiety and hopelessness, caused by loneliness. You are abandoning the journey in favor of introspection and personal enlightenment. The feeling of being crushed by the world around you may be stronger than ever, but be careful not to descend too deeply into the darkness on your quest for insight.": "腐化的隐士带来了令人消沉不安和绝望的情绪，由孤独引起。你选择放弃旅程，转而追求内省和个人启蒙。被世界压垮的感觉可能比以往任何时候都更强烈，但要小心不要在追求洞察力的过程中陷入过深的黑暗中。",
	"Wisdom, introspection and guidance are all hallmarks of the classic Hermit. This is a healthy time to be alone, and search for answers within. Unlike when The Hanged Man appears, no great sacrifice is being asked of you. One of the most understated cards, The Hermit represents a valuable moment of quietude. Tune out the chaos around you and retreat for a little while.": "智慧、内省和指引是经典隐士(`Hermit`)的特点。现在正是独处、内心探索答案的健康时机。与倒吊者(`The Hanged Man`)出现时不同，你并没有被要求做出巨大的牺牲。作为最被低估的牌之一，隐士代表了宝贵的宁静时刻。屏蔽周围的混乱，暂时退隐一段时间。",
	"The child rebels against the father. Anointed and indulged, cosseted and caged, the golden crown and scepter bind the Hierophant's intent. The only escape is insurrection. The corrupted Hierophant embodies revolt and revolution: tradition has betrayed you. It is time for innovative thinking and bold strategy.": "孩子反抗父亲。受膏和纵容，被宠坏和囚禁，黄金王冠和权杖束缚了（大祭司）的意图。唯一的逃脱是起义。腐化的（大祭司）体现了叛乱和革命：传统已经背叛了你。现在是创新思维和大胆策略的时候。",
	"The traditional Hierophant is the very essence of tradition itself. This may represent an institution in your life with established rituals and expectations, or an established set of practices in your workplace or home life. Although the Hierophant can represent a stifling, dogmatic figure, conformity can have its uses: we don't need to fix what isn't broken.": "传统的祭司（Hierophant）代表着传统的本质。这可能代表着你生活中的一个机构，拥有既定的仪式和期望，或者是你工作场所或家庭生活中的一套既定做法。尽管祭司可能代表着一种令人窒息的、教条主义的形象，但符合规范也有其用处：我们不需要修复那些没有问题的事物。",
	"Be wary of deception or of being led astray. The corrupted High Priestess warns us of a disconnect between our present course and what we know, deep inside us, to be wise. You may be experiencing confusion or uncertainty: your intuition is beng blocked. To reach the right decision, you must find a way to trust yourself again.": "要警惕欺骗或被误导。堕落的女祭司(`High Priestess`)警告我们，我们当前的行动与我们内心深处的智慧之间存在脱节。你可能正在经历困惑或不确定：你的直觉被阻碍了。要做出正确的决定，你必须找到重新信任自己的方法。",
	"The High Priestess is archetype of intuition. She represents the balance truck between two extremes or worlds—these extremes are often represented by pillars to either side of her. She is a mediator and a guide. but her dominion is the realm of spirituality and the unconscious mind.": "女祭司是直觉的原型。她代表着两个极端或世界之间的平衡，这些极端通常由她两侧的柱子代表。她是一位调解者和向导，但她的领域是灵性和无意识心灵的领域。",
	"With the corrupted Lovers, we take a more personal look at what it means to be a lover. Instead of two universal beings coming together in a divinely sanctioned union, the singular lover has both elements inside them—as shown by the different tattoos on their arms. The figure is consumed by their reflection—the mirror a placeholder for their mind and thoughts—to the detriment of the cracking, dusty, and neglected world around them.": "在与堕落恋人(`Corrupted Lovers`)的对抗中，我们更加个人化地探讨了成为恋人的含义。与两个普遍存在的实体在神圣认可的结合中相比，这个独特的恋人内心包含了两种元素——正如他们手臂上不同的纹身所展示的那样。这个人物被自己的倒影所吞噬——镜子代表了他们的思想和心灵，而这种沉迷却对周围破裂、尘土飞扬、被忽视的世界造成了危害。",
	"The Lovers represent many things, but at their heart all of them can be reduced down to a relationship, either between two people or between yourself and your conscience or ideology. Most commonly. The Lovers appear to signify love, romance, and strong partnership, but sometimes were being asked to choose between love and something else—tradition, duty, or ambition.": "恋人代表许多事物，但归根结底，所有这些事物都可以归纳为一种关系，要么是两个人之间的关系，要么是你与你的良心或意识形态之间的关系。最常见的情况是，恋人象征着爱情、浪漫和强大的伙伴关系，但有时我们被要求在爱情和其他事物之间做出选择——传统、责任或抱负。",
	"As above, so below. The corrupted Magician is the embodiment of manipulation, where he once stood for power and expertise. Feelings of disorganization and impotence are at an all-time high when the corrupted Magician is drawn in a reading. Classic imagery of Mercury or Hermes is now twisted, as the souls of the dead refuse their place.": "上面如是，下面亦然。堕落的魔术师是操纵的化身，他曾经代表力量和专业。当堕落的魔术师出现在阅读中时，人们会感到无序和无能为力的情绪达到了顶峰。水星或赫尔墨斯的经典形象现在被扭曲，因为死者的灵魂拒绝了他们的位置。",
	"The Magician is focused and experienced, unlike {@card the Fool|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT}. He knows how to transform the {@card The Fool|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT|Fool's} pure potential into actual power: he embodies willpower itself.

When the corrupted Moon appears in a reading. you need to muster your courage and sense of self, lest you remain lost in the darkness.": "一个破碎的狼人倒影——在她混乱的思维中一样不稳定如同她的身体形态。她拒绝接受自己的所有面向，包括她的弱点和怪物本质。当堕落的月亮出现在一次占卜中时，你需要鼓起勇气和自我意识，否则你将继续迷失在黑暗中。",
	"Nothing is as it appears when The Moon appears in a reading. Dreamlike and enchanting, The Moon represents illusion and messages from our unconscious selves. Be wary of tricksters and false paths; fear and anxiety may be strong at this time. Let your intuition guide you and you will make it through the night.": "当出现月亮(The Moon)牌时，一切都不尽如人意。梦幻而迷人，月亮代表着幻觉和来自我们潜意识的信息。要警惕骗子和虚假的道路；恐惧和焦虑可能在这个时候很强烈。让直觉引导你，你将度过这个黑夜。",
	"Missing light, lack of hope, the questioning of faith. When we are open to the universe and all it can offer, The Star seems to fill us with energy, but in this reversal of fate, we cannot see the light. Instead of feeling blessed, we feel lost and alone. The sky has not changed. We simply need to keep looking.": "缺失的光芒，缺乏希望，对信仰的质疑。当我们敞开心扉迎接宇宙及其所能提供的一切时，（星星）似乎会充满我们能量，但在这种命运的逆转中，我们无法看到光明。我们感觉迷失和孤独，而不是被祝福。天空并未改变，我们只需要继续寻找。",
	"The Star symbolizes retaining hope after disaster has struck.

Although {@card The Sun|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT} brings us more joy, The Star promises recovery and survival after enduring great hardship.": "星星象征着在灾难袭击后保持希望。在{@card The Tower|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT}的灾难之后，传统的星星可以被视为塔罗牌中最明亮的点。尽管{@card The Sun|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT}给我们带来更多的快乐，但星星承诺在经历巨大困难后恢复和生存。",
	"Hope is blocked. Your inspiration, energy and happiness are being drained. Feelings of depression and powerlessness rule your life at this time, and much like the gold packed around a richly buried monarch, the light that surrounds you is false and cold.": "希望被阻挡了。你的灵感、能量和快乐正在被抽干。抑郁和无力感支配着你的生活，就像包裹着一个富有的埋葬君主的黄金一样，围绕着你的光芒是虚假而冰冷的。",
	"The traditional reading of The Sun is a true moment of joy. When this card appears it represents happiness, success, exuberance, generosity an kindness. You are a beacon to those around you.": "看到太阳（The Sun）这张牌传统的解读会带来真正的喜悦。当这张牌出现时，代表着幸福、成功、热情、慷慨和善良。你是周围人的明灯。",
	"The cataclysm of The Tower cannot be avoided, whether upright or reversed, pure or corrupted. Like {@card Death|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT}, The Tower represents inexorable change. Here, you are defending the tower with everything you have. Though beautiful, it is not as sturdy and reliable as you think. Some things cannot be fixed: they must be broken. Its use to you has passed.": "无论是正位还是逆位，纯净还是腐化，塔的灾变都是不可避免的。就像{@card Death|Corrupted Tarot|WWCT}一样，塔代表着无法抗拒的变化。在这里，你正在全力捍卫这座塔。尽管美丽，但它并不像你想象的那样坚固可靠。有些事情无法修复：它们必须被打破。它对你的用处已经过去了。",
	"One of the most dreaded cards in Tarot, the classic Tower appears to warn us of a great schism that will fundamentally alter our lives in some way.

	"The snake has released its tail, and we are about to start the beginning of the end. We're on the verge of a massive disaster... but the final drop hasn't happened quite yet.

However, like the snake shedding its skin, after great loss a new cycle is poised to begin.": "蛇已经释放了它的尾巴，我们即将开始末日的开始。我们正处在一场巨大灾难的边缘……但最后一击还没有发生。被腐化的世界牌象征着拥有你认为想要的一切，却依然感到空虚和与周围人隔绝的悲剧。然而，就像蛇蜕皮一样，在巨大的损失之后，一个新的循环即将开始。",
	"Apotheosis. The World is the last note in a perfect song: here, at least traditionally, we reach the ending of one cycle and prepare to start anew.

	"The infamous Three of Swords is a classic warning of pain and betrayal.
