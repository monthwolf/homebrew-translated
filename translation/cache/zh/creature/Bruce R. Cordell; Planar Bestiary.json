	"During my formative gaming years in the 1980s, I occasionally ran tabletop roleplaying games for my friends. Early on, that was mostly D&D, just like you'd expect. But our group branched out into other systems as they came to our attention through the pages of Dragon magazine. One of those was Gamma World, a game about adventuring in a vastly changed new world following a nuclear holocaust. I was keen to run it and bring my group of friends into an alternate dimension of mutants and radioactive threats the likes of which they'd never seen before.": "在80年代我形成游戏的时候，我偶尔为朋友们主持桌面角色扮演游戏。一开始，我们主要玩的是D&D(龙与地下城)，就像你期望的那样。但随着Dragon(龙)杂志的介绍，我们的团队开始尝试其他系统。其中之一是《伽玛世界》(Gamma World)，这是一个关于在核战后的世界中冒险的游戏。我很想主持这个游戏，让我的朋友们进入一个充满突变体和放射性威胁的新世界，这是他们从未见过的。",
	"So one afternoon we sat down and rolled up characters. Someone had scored a secondary source of new abilities from a different publisher. I don't recall where it came from, but the players were eager to fuse those additional interesting quirks into their characters, and I was all for it. Getting everything squared away during character creation took well over an hour, maybe two.": "所以一个下午，我们坐下来创建角色。有人得到了来自另一家出版商的第二来源的新能力。我不记得它是从哪里来的，但玩家们都渴望将这些额外有趣的特点融入到他们的角色中，而我也完全赞成。在角色创建过程中一切都搞定花了超过一个小时，也许两个小时。",
	"But finally, it was time to play! I had a short location ready for the PCs to explore: a gargantuan land ark constructed generations earlier, partly buried, filled with moldering super‑science remnants and horrible monsters. And in the very first compartment the PCs opened, they encountered gamma moths.": "但最终，是时候开始游戏了！我准备了一个简短的地点让玩家角色（PCs）探索：一个巨大的陆地方舟，数代人前建造，部分被埋，充满了腐烂的超级科技遗物和可怕的怪物。在玩家打开的第一个舱室里，他们遇到了伽马蛾。",
	"According to my recollection, gamma moths were radioactive. The monster entry asked that I roll on a radiation reaction chart to see what weird thing would happen to the PCs. I rolled, and in my shock at the result, I blurted it out loud before I could think twice about the repercussions: \"You're all dead!\"": "据我记忆，伽玛飞蛾是放射性的。怪物条目要求我在辐射反应表上掷骰，以查看PC会发生什么奇怪的事情。我掷了骰子，在看到结果时震惊得说出来，还没来得及考虑后果：“你们都死了！”",
	"Which I knew, even as I said it, was a terrible, no‑good way for the game to go. Chalk it up to a learning experience we all benefited from. Sometimes, you gotta let the dice inform your decisions as the GM, not dictate them. I mean, sure, a total party kill might eventually be in the cards; I've got a reputation to consider. But not during the first encounter.": "就在我说这句话的时候，我就知道这是一个糟糕透顶的游戏发展方式。把它归因于我们都受益的一次学习经历吧。有时候，你必须让骰子指导你作为(GM)的决定，而不是支配它们。我是说，当然，全灭可能最终会发生；我还要考虑我的声誉。但不会在第一次遭遇中。",
	"Learn from my mistake. When you take your game someplace strange, like a perilous new world of the Material Plane or some other place in the multiverse, pay attention to what the monsters encountered there—and let's face it, there will be monsters—can actually do if they're new to you.": "吸取我的教训。当你把你的游戏带到一个陌生的地方，比如物质位面的一个危险新世界或者多元宇宙中的其他地方时，要注意那里遇到的怪物——面对现实吧，那里肯定会有怪物——如果它们对你来说是新的，要注意它们实际上能做什么。",
	"Guess what? Planar Bestiary is a trove of monsters gathered from across the planes of existence. All of them have an odd quirk, an unexpected backstory related to crossplanar travel or a dimensional anomaly, or possibly a deadly ability designed to test foes to the limit and beyond. New fiends and celestials, weird aberrations and monstrosities, and strange new humanoids (including some that hail from worlds of high technology) can be found within these pages.": "猜猜看？《位面怪兽图鉴》是从各个位面收集而来的怪物宝库。它们都有一个奇怪的特点，一个与跨位面旅行或维度异常相关的意想不到的背景故事，或者可能是一个旨在考验敌人极限甚至超越极限的致命能力。在这些页面中，你可以找到新的恶魔和天神，奇怪的畸变生物和怪物，以及来自高科技世界的奇怪新人类（包括一些）。",
	"However, here's my solemn promise to you: breathe easy—no gamma moths wait in ambush here.": "然而，这是我对你的庄严承诺：放心—这里没有伏击等着你的伽玛飞蛾。",
	"Planar Bestiary was developed as part of the Path of the Planebreaker crowdfunding campaign, which presents new alternate worlds, including new planar class options, subclasses, feats, items, spells, player character species options, and of course, new planar monsters for the GM. Despite that, you don't need the Path of the Planebreaker book to use and enjoy Planar Bestiary. All you need is a working knowledge of the 5E ruleset.": "《位面魔兽图鉴》是作为《位面破坏者之路》众筹活动的一部分开发的，其中包括新的替代世界，新的位面职业选项，子职业，专长，物品，法术，玩家角色物种选项，当然还有新的位面怪物供GM使用。尽管如此，您并不需要《位面破坏者之路》这本书来使用和享受《位面魔兽图鉴》。您只需要对5E规则有一定的了解即可。",

Every creature in the area except the myrmic colossus must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature that failed their saving throw is restrained by rubble. A creature can be freed if they or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds.": "在20号先攻（失败则先攻平局）时，蚁巨兽猛烈地撞向隧道墙壁，导致以蚁巨兽为中心的60英尺半径范围内的隧道部分坍塌。该区域内的每个生物（蚁巨兽除外）必须通过一次DC 17的敏捷豁免检定，否则将受到18（4d8）点钝击伤害，豁免成功则只受一半伤害。该区域成为艰难地形，每个未通过豁免检定的生物都被碎石束缚。如果一个生物或另一个生物采取行动进行一次DC 15的力量检定并成功，被束缚的生物可以获得自由。",

The target can attempt a {@dc 15} Wisdom (Perception) check each round to notice the ill effect the song is having, or be shaken out of their trance by another's action. An abolisher of sorrow's song usually leaves someone who fails to realize its effect with only {@dice 1d4} Intelligence remaining. This reduction lasts until the victim is healed by a {@spell greater restoration} spell or comparable magic.": "在距离镇压者60英尺范围内的一只生物必须成功通过一个{@dc 12}感知豁免才能免受3({@damage 1d6})点心灵伤害，并且每轮镇压者保持歌声时失去1点智力（即，他们的智力值减少1）。目标每轮可以尝试一个{@dc 15}感知（智力）检定来注意到歌曲正在产生的不良影响，或者被他人的行动摇醒。一位忧伤镇压者的歌曲通常会让那些未意识到其效果的人只剩下{@dice 1d4}点智力。这种减少会持续直到受害者被一个{@spell greater restoration}法术或类似魔法治愈。",

	"Blown off course by especially violent planar maelstroms, mated abolisher pairs can end up in other dimensions, especially on worlds of the Material Plane.

Later, they may forget where they got the creature and simply let it go someplace new.": "在特别猛烈的位面漩涡中被吹离航线，配对的废除者可能会出现在其他维度，尤其是物质位面的世界上。有时候，穿越精灵界十字路口的旅行者会遇到一只孤独的废除者，觉得它很美丽，就会抓住它带走，当作战利品或宠物。后来，他们可能会忘记从哪里得到这只生物，然后干脆放它到一个新地方去。",
	"Creatures native to the Feywild are not subject to the abolisher's song, as its music is the sound and substance of the plane itself.

But a creature snared by an abolisher's song can become so entranced that they don't realize their memories are slowly fading until they've got nothing left.": "生活在Feywild的生物不受(`the abolisher's song`)的影响，因为它的音乐就是那个位面的声音和实质。对于其他生物来说，(`the abolisher`)迷人的旋律就像一种心灵安慰。但是被(`the abolisher's song`)所困的生物可能会陷入如此的迷醉中，以至于他们意识不到自己的记忆正在慢慢消逝，直到最终一无所有。",
	"Despite the dangers of listening to abolishers overlong, these creatures are named for how some people use them to lessen the sting of loss from a loved one's death or other tragedy. The grieving allow their painful memories to be washed away by this bird's captivating tune. However, if the process isn't monitored by a third party, those seeking relief from their sadness eventually lose too many memories to recall even their own name.": "尽管听取废除者的警告可能存在危险，但这些生物的名字来源于人们如何利用它们来减轻因所爱之人的死亡或其他悲剧而带来的痛苦。哀伤的人们允许这些痛苦的记忆被这只鸟迷人的曲调冲刷掉。然而，如果这个过程没有第三方监督，寻求从悲伤中获得解脱的人最终会失去太多记忆，甚至无法回忆起自己的名字。",
	"The nest of a mated pair of abolishers eventually contains {@dice 1d4} perfect eggs with shells of iridescent crystal, as beautiful to gaze upon as an abolisher's song is to hear.

Or if things go wrong, forge a joyfully destructive new accumulator.": "虽然大多数蓄能器自然形成于元素混沌中，但也有一些是由巫师实验室和其他冒着超越常识边缘的危险进行实验的人制造出来的，他们试图从金属、玻璃和粗糙材料中提取能量。如果某物能导电，也许经过适当处理后它就能储存一场雷暴的能量。或者如果事情出了问题，就可能锻造出一个充满喜悦毁灭力的新蓄能器。",

	"Although agonizers are intelligent, they are barely sentient and (much like golems) lack emotional depth. A common fiend might enjoy torturing a victim just for the pleasure of hearing it scream, but an agonizer's response to pain or pleasure (its own or another's) is muted; they don't react to torture or even mortal threats with anything other than mild annoyance. They can experience pain, but the sensation is more akin to a slight itch than anything else. They have no ambition or desires. These qualities make them excellent guards and torturers, for they can't be bribed or coerced, nor do they understand mercy.": "虽然折磨者们聪明，但它们几乎没有感知能力，（就像魔像一样）缺乏情感深度。一个普通的恶魔可能会喜欢折磨受害者，只是为了听到它尖叫的快感，但折磨者对于疼痛或快乐（无论是自己的还是别人的）的反应是淡漠的；它们对折磨甚至致命威胁的反应只是轻微的烦恼。它们可以感受到疼痛，但这种感觉更像是轻微的痒，而不是其他什么。它们没有野心或欲望。这些特质使它们成为出色的卫士和折磨者，因为它们既不能被贿赂也不能被胁迫，也不理解仁慈。",

	"Once, dissolute angels worked to enforce the plans and commandments of good-aligned gods, sometimes providing aid, other times acting as a god's strong hand. But that was before. A long road of bad choices and questionable bargains can lead an angel to lose their status and their wings. Most dissolute angels proudly display the bloodied stumps, even piercing them with cruel iron hooks and jewelry depicting skulls and small blades. When roused to fury, their eyes take on a reddish gleam that some could mistake for hellfire. Instead of maces, they wield greatswords wreathed in death and ash.": "曾经，放荡不羁的天使们努力执行善良神明的计划和戒律，有时提供帮助，有时充当神的强有力之手。但那已经是过去的事了。一条充满错误选择和可疑交易的长路可能导致一个天使失去他们的地位和翅膀。大多数放荡不羁的天使自豪地展示着那血淋淋的残肢，甚至用残酷的铁钩和描绘骷髅和小刀的珠宝穿孔。当被激怒时，他们的眼睛会闪现出一种红色的光芒，有些人可能会误认为是地狱之火。他们手持的不是狼牙棒，而是缠绕着死亡和灰烬的巨剑。",

	"Some angels \"fall\" when their pride leads them to judge a situation prematurely, such that the angel, believing they're doing right, actually does the opposite. Dissolute angels, however, know exactly where and when they crossed the line. They feel a vindication that it was their choice, not something imposed upon them by others. For a dissolute angel, the ideal of \"freedom at any cost\" often masks their own inability to feel empathy for anyone but themselves.": "有些天使因为骄傲导致他们过早地对情况进行评判而“堕落”，这样一来，天使相信自己在做正确的事情，实际上却做了相反的事情。然而，放荡不羁的天使知道他们究竟在何时何地越过了界限。他们感到一种被证明是他们的选择，而不是别人强加给他们的东西的满足感。对于放荡不羁的天使来说，“不惜任何代价的自由”理念常常掩盖了他们对除了自己之外的任何人都无法感同身受的事实。",
	"Instead of becoming outcasts or seeking to get as far away from the Upper Planes as possible by looking to rule below, dissolute angels often set themselves directly against the interests of the gods they once served. Doing so openly, of course, would probably lead to their quick demise. Instead, dissolute angels work from the shadows. They form cults that draw in vulnerable adherents, slowly leading these hopeful parishioners through an accumulation of small lies and group acts to become foot soldiers in a war against some good-aligned deity's most dearly held beliefs and/or believers.": "与成为被放逐者或试图尽可能远离上层位面的情况不同，放荡的天使经常直接与曾经侍奉的神明的利益对立。当然，公开这样做可能会导致他们迅速灭亡。相反，放荡的天使在暗中行事。他们组建教派，吸引易受影响的信徒，通过积累一系列小谎言和团体行动，慢慢地将这些充满希望的教众引导成为一场针对某位善良阵营神明最珍视信念和/或信徒的战争中的步兵。",

The detection is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.": "在10分钟内，战争天使知道30英尺范围内是否有异常生物、天界生物、元素生物、精灵、邪恶生物或不死生物，以及这些生物的位置。同样，战争天使也知道30英尺范围内是否有被魔法祝福或亵渎的地方或物体。探测会被1英尺厚的石头、1英寸厚的普通金属、一张薄铅片或3英尺厚的木头或泥土所阻挡。",
	"When divine hosts assemble, frontline warriors are called to form fire teams, troops, and companies. War angels—celestials who have trained to work together to combat evil at the behest of a greater angel, avatar, or god—often make up a portion of these armies.

	"It is commonly held that greater angels like devas, planetars, and solars take shape in the divine afterimage of gods. Thus, it is believed, these beings possess a hint of the individual gods that shaped them. War angels, however, are usually chosen to be trained and raised up as a reward, blessing, or requirement of penitence to wash away some past indiscretion. Their former lives are not forgotten entirely, but recalled only as a dream. For a war angel, training and battle are the most important things.": "普遍认为，像(Devas)，(Planetars)，和(Solars)这样的高等天使在神祗的神圣残影中获得形态。因此，人们相信这些存在拥有塑造它们的个别神祗的一丝气息。然而，战争天使通常被选择接受训练和提升，作为一种奖励、祝福，或者赎罪的要求，以洗刷一些过去的过失。他们以前的生活并没有完全被遗忘，只是被回忆为一个梦。对于战争天使来说，训练和战斗是最重要的事情。",
	"Sometimes a war angel is sent to aid mortals, though unlike the greater angels, they arrive as an ally, not a commander. While some mortals might prefer an ally who takes charge, others appreciate a war angel's willingness to work alongside them.": "有时候，一位战争天使会被派遣来帮助凡人，尽管不像更高级的天使那样作为指挥官出现，他们会作为盟友到来。虽然一些凡人可能更喜欢一个能够主导的盟友，但也有人欣赏战争天使愿意与他们并肩作战的态度。",

	"Glacier imps feel warmth is a broken promise and seek to enact revenge on those who would carry a torch or lantern—or even radiate body warmth—in their presence. Which is why living creatures are the favored enemies of glacier imps, who want to extinguish that warmth and entomb it beneath an eternal layer of ice. The imps often ignore undead and other constructs whose body temperatures are the same as that of their surroundings, at least until their trespass becomes too much to bear.": "冰川小恶魔认为温暖是一个破碎的承诺，并寻求报复那些会在它们面前拿着火炬或灯笼——甚至散发体温的人。这就是为什么生物是冰川小恶魔最喜欢的敌人，它们想要扑灭那份温暖，并将其埋藏在永恒的冰层之下。这些小恶魔经常忽视不死生物和其他构造体，因为它们的体温与周围环境相同，至少直到它们的侵犯变得无法忍受为止。",

These beings flourish in the cold, and when two or more are set to watch a particular location, they generally last for decades before they must face down potential intruders.": "如果遇到一个冰川小恶魔，附近可能至少还有一两个。这些生物在寒冷环境中茁壮成长，当两个或更多被派去监视特定位置时，它们通常能持续数十年，直到不得不面对潜在的入侵者。",

	"A trained glimmer moth can serve as a flying mount for a Medium or smaller creature (despite being only Medium size itself ). If the glimmer moth is moved against its will while carrying a rider, the rider doesn't need to make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling, because it is the moth that holds the rider. If the rider is knocked {@condition prone}, the moth must succeed on a {@dc 10} Strength saving throw to retain its hold on them. If the moth would be knocked {@condition prone}, it instead dips about 10 feet before reestablishing stable flight. Otherwise, the rules for mounted combat apply to the glimmer moth and its rider.": "一只经过训练的微光飞蛾可以作为中型或更小生物的飞行坐骑（尽管它本身只有中型大小）。如果飞蛾在携带骑乘者时被迫移动，骑乘者不需要进行敏捷豁免才能避免摔落，因为是飞蛾在托着骑乘者。如果骑乘者被击倒{@condition prone}，飞蛾必须进行一次{@dc 10}力量豁免才能保持对它们的控制。如果飞蛾会被击倒{@condition prone}，它会在重新确立稳定飞行前下降约10英尺。否则，关于骑乘战斗的规则适用于微光飞蛾及其骑乘者。",

A rider is hugged tightly to the creature's abdomen by the glimmer moth's soft but firm legs, even as the wings blur into motion and carry them aloft. It might be more accurate to call a rider a passenger; however, a rider can direct the moth's path through the air by shifting their weight just so, or by verbally instructing the moth where they wish to go. Because of the manner in which they are held, riders have free use of their arms and an unobstructed view of what lies in front of and below them.": "在Feywild中，闪光蛾被培育成为精灵贵族用作飞行坐骑。骑手被闪光蛾柔软但坚实的腿紧紧搂住在腹部，即使翅膀模糊成动作并将它们带起飞。更准确地说，可以称骑手为乘客；然而，骑手可以通过微调体重或口头指示蛾飞向他们希望去的地方。由于他们的姿势，骑手可以自由运用双臂，并清晰地看到前方和下方的景象。",

	"Each time a thorn dancer succeeds on a mission of protection, it carves a symbol or a stylized series of images into its bark-like flesh to memorialize the event. Some thorn dancers are so covered in such carvings that they seem heavily scarred upon first viewing.

In fact, doing so may be a way to begin a conversation with one before the dancer puts a thorn in the stranger's eye.": "每当一名荆棘舞者成功完成一次保护任务，它会在类似树皮的肌肤上雕刻一个符号或一系列风格化的图像来纪念这一事件。一些荆棘舞者身上覆盖着如此多的这种雕刻，以至于初次看到时似乎被严重烙印。参与这种个人仪式的荆棘舞者几乎总是乐意讲述每个雕刻背后更大的故事，只要被问及。事实上，这样做可能是在舞者将荆棘插入陌生人眼睛之前开始与其对话的一种方式。",

	"Zeitgebar witnesses move from one obsession to the next, during which time they stare at that subject for hours, days, or even weeks at a time, taking in obvious and subtle information as they do so. A likely subject of their attention could be a portal, a strange device, a corpse, or what looks to others like a strange spot on the wall of an ancient ruin. It's hard to know what will draw a witness's attention. Sometimes they seem to know when something of import is going to happen before it does, and they show up a few hours or days ahead of time to stare at the area where that event—perhaps a collision, a fight, or something odd falling out of the sky—eventually occurs.": "时代守望者（Zeitgebar）会从一个痴迷转移到另一个，期间他们会连续几个小时、几天，甚至几周盯着那个主题，同时吸收明显和微妙的信息。他们可能会关注的主题包括传送门、奇怪的装置、尸体，或者在古代废墟墙壁上对其他人看来像是一个奇怪的斑点。很难知道什么会引起守望者的注意。有时候他们似乎知道重要事件即将发生，会提前几个小时或几天出现在事件最终发生的地点盯着那个区域，也许是一场碰撞、一场打斗，或者一些奇怪的东西从天空中掉落。",
	"If a creature comes within 30 feet of a zeitgebar witness from almost any direction, the witness is potentially startled and could become aggressive. However, if approached from the front (the direction of its gaze), it remains peaceful and open to interaction, unless attacked. A witness speaks a variety of languages with a strangely artificial voice. The creature may provide an interesting piece of information, but only if the PCs have something interesting to say about the object or area the witness is already studying.": "如果一个生物从几乎任何方向靠近一个来自(`Zeitgebar`)的见证者，见证者可能会感到惊慌并可能变得具有攻击性。然而，如果从正面（即其凝视的方向）接近，它会保持平静并愿意互动，除非遭到攻击。见证者用一种奇怪的人工声音讲多种语言。如果(`PCs`)对见证者已经研究的物体或区域有趣的话题，生物可能会提供一条有趣的信息。"
