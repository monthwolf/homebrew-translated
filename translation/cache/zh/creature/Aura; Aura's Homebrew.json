	"While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.": "在蝙蝠形态下，吸血鬼无法说话，行走速度为5英尺，飞行速度为30英尺。它的属性除了大小和速度之外保持不变。它所穿戴的物品会随着变形，但它所携带的物品不会。如果吸血鬼死亡，它会恢复到真实形态。",
	"While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.": "在雾态下，吸血鬼不能采取任何行动，说话，或操纵物体。它没有重量，拥有20英尺的飞行速度，可以悬停，并可以进入敌对生物的空间并停留在那里。此外，如果空气可以通过一个空间，雾气可以自由通过而无需挤压，但不能通过水。它在力量、敏捷和体质豁免检定上有优势，并对所有非魔法伤害免疫，除了来自阳光的伤害。",
	"If the Minotaur Shaman (vampire) fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.": "如果牛头怪萨满（吸血鬼）未能通过豁免检定，它可以选择成功。",
	"When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the Minotaur Shaman (vampire) transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling {@condition unconscious}, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.": "当牛头怪萨满（吸血鬼）在休息地之外的地方降至0点生命值时，它会变成一团雾气（如同变形者特性），而不是倒下{@condition unconscious}，前提是它不处于阳光或流动水中。如果它无法变形，它将被摧毁。",
	"While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then {@condition paralyzed} until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.": "当以雾态形式拥有0点命中点数时，它无法恢复成吸血鬼形态，并且必须在2小时内到达其安息之地，否则将被摧毁。一旦到达其安息之地，它会恢复成吸血鬼形态。在重新获得至少1点命中点数之前，它是{@condition paralyzed}。在安息之地度过1小时后，拥有0点命中点数的吸血鬼会恢复1点命中点数。",
	"The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.": "吸血鬼在其回合开始时恢复20点生命值，如果其至少有1点生命值且不处于阳光或流动水中。如果吸血鬼受到辐射伤害或圣水伤害，该特性在吸血鬼的下一个回合开始时不起作用。",

	"{@i Stake to the Heart.} If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is {@condition incapacitated} in its resting place, the vampire is {@condition paralyzed} until the stake is removed.": "{@i Stake to the Heart.} 如果一把木制穿刺武器被驱入吸血鬼的心脏，而吸血鬼正处于其休息地{@condition incapacitated}，那么吸血鬼将被{@condition paralyzed}，直到木桩被移除。",
	"{@i Sunlight Hypersensitivity.} The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.": "{@i Sunlight Hypersensitivity.} 吸血鬼在阳光下开始回合时受到20点辐射伤害。在阳光下，它的攻击检定和能力检定都有劣势。",

The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a {@creature vampire spawn} under the vampire's control.": "{@atk mw} {@hit 9} 进行攻击，射程5英尺，一个愿意的生物，或者是被吸血鬼，{@condition incapacitated}，或{@condition restrained} 攻击的生物。造成{@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) 穿刺伤害加上10 ({@damage 3d6}) 死灵伤害。目标的生命值上限减少等同于所受的死灵伤害数量，并且吸血鬼回复等同于该数值的生命值。这种减少持续到目标完成一次长休。如果这个效果将目标的生命值上限降低到0，目标将死亡。以这种方式被杀死的人型生物，然后被埋在地下，在第二天晚上会作为{@creature vampire spawn}受吸血鬼控制的不死生物复活。",
	"The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be {@condition charmed} by the vampire. The {@condition charmed} target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack.": "这只吸血鬼选择一个在它能看到的30英尺范围内的人形生物作为目标。如果目标能看到吸血鬼，目标必须成功通过一次{@dc 17} 以智慧豁免魔法，否则将被吸血鬼{@condition charmed}。被{@condition charmed}的目标视吸血鬼为一个值得信任的朋友，应该被听从和保护。虽然目标并不受吸血鬼的控制，但会以最有利的方式接受吸血鬼的请求或行动，并且愿意成为吸血鬼的咬击攻击的目标。",
	"Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.": "每当吸血鬼或吸血鬼的同伴对目标造成伤害时，目标可以重复豁免扑克牌，若成功则效果结束。否则，效果持续24小时，或直到吸血鬼被消灭、位于与目标不同的存在平面上，或采取一个奖励动作来结束效果。",
	"The vampire magically calls {@dice 2d4} swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call {@dice 3d6} wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in {@dice 1d4} rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.": "这个吸血鬼可以使用魔法召唤{@dice 2d4}蝙蝠或老鼠，前提是太阳没有升起。在户外时，吸血鬼可以召唤{@dice 3d6}狼代替。被召唤的生物在{@dice 1d4}回合后到达，作为吸血鬼的盟友并遵从其口头命令。这些野兽会持续1小时，直到吸血鬼死亡，或者吸血鬼将它们作为一个额外动作解散。",

	"Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.": "在无尽的黑夜中觉醒，吸血鬼渴望他们失去的生命，并通过饮食活人的血来满足这种渴望。吸血鬼厌恶阳光，因为阳光会灼伤他们。他们从不投下阴影或反射，任何希望在活人中悄无声息地移动的吸血鬼都会保持在黑暗中，远离反光表面。",
	"Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.": "无论吸血鬼是否保留了前世的记忆，它们的情感依恋都会随着不死之身扭曲。爱变成了饥渴的痴迷，友谊变成了痛苦的嫉妒。吸血鬼追求的不再是情感，而是他们渴望的物质象征，因此一个寻求爱情的吸血鬼可能会着迷于一个年轻的美人。一个沉迷于青春和潜力的吸血鬼可能会将一个孩子视为一个迷人的对象。其他人则用艺术、书籍或者像酷刑器具或来自已杀生物的战利品等邪恶物品来包围自己。",
	"Most of a vampire's victims become vampire spawn-ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.": "大多数吸血鬼的受害者会变成吸血鬼衍生物——渴望血液的生物，但受到创造它们的吸血鬼控制。如果一位真正的吸血鬼允许一个衍生物从自己的身体吸血，那个衍生物就会转变成一个真正的吸血鬼，不再受主人的控制。很少有吸血鬼愿意以这种方式放弃控制。当他们的创造者死亡时，吸血鬼衍生物会变得自由意志。",
	"Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.": "每个吸血鬼都与其棺材、地下室或坟墓遗址绑定在一起，在那里它必须在白天休息。如果一个吸血鬼没有得到正式的埋葬，它必须躺在转变为不死生物的地方下面一英尺深的土壤之下。吸血鬼可以通过搬运其棺材或大量坟墓土壤到另一个地点来移动其埋葬地点。一些吸血鬼通过这种方式建立多个休息地点。",
	"Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.": "吸血鬼和吸血鬼衍生物都不需要空气。",
	"A vampire chooses a grand yet defensible location for its lair, such as a castle, fortified manor, or walled abbey. It hides its coffin in an underground crypt or vault guarded by vampire spawn or other loyal creatures of the night.": "一只吸血鬼选择一个宏伟而又易守的地点作为它的巢穴，比如城堡、设防的庄园，或者有城墙的修道院。它把自己的棺材藏在地下的地窖或保护着的地下室里，由吸血鬼子嗣或其他忠诚的夜间生物守护着。",
	"The game statistics of a player character transformed into a vampire spawn and then a vampire don't change, except that the character's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 18 if they aren't higher. In addition, the character gains the vampire's damage resistances, {@sense darkvision}, traits, and actions. Attack and damage rolls for the vampire's attacks are based on Strength.": "玩家角色转变为吸血鬼孵化者然后是吸血鬼后，游戏统计数据不会改变，除非角色的力量、敏捷和体质分数变为18（如果原本不高于18）。此外，角色获得吸血鬼的伤害抗性、{@sense darkvision}、特性和行动。吸血鬼的攻击和伤害骰使用力量属性。",
	"The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire's proficiency bonus + the vampire's Charisma modifier. The character's alignment becomes lawful evil, and the DM might take control of the character until the vampirism is reversed with a {@spell wish} spell or the character is killed and brought back to life.": "迷惑的豁免 DC 为 8 + 吸血鬼的熟练加值 + 吸血鬼的魅力修正。角色的阵营变为守序邪恶，而且在用 {@spell wish} 法术逆转吸血症或者角色被杀死并复活之前，DM 可能会控制角色。",
	"A brilliant thinker and capable warrior in life, Strahd von Zarovich fought in countless battles for his people. When war and killing finally stripped him of his youth and strength, he settled in the remote valley of Barovia and built a castle on a towering pinnacle, from which he could survey his lands. His brother Sergei came to live with him in Castle Ravenloft, becoming Strahd's adviser and constant companion.": "在生活中，Strahd von Zarovich 是一位杰出的思想家和能干的战士。他为了自己的人民参加了无数战斗。当战争和杀戮最终夺走了他的青春和力量时，他定居在巴罗维亚的偏远山谷，并在一座高耸的尖塔上建造了一座城堡，从那里他可以俯瞰自己的土地。他的兄弟Sergei 来到 Ravenloft 城堡与他同住，成为了Strahd 的顾问和忠实伴侣。",
	"In his brother, Strahd saw everything he had lost. Sergei was handsome and young, while Strahd had become old and scarred. Resentment colored their relationship, eventually turning into hatred. Strahd's beloved, Tatyana, spurned him for Sergei, whom she pledged to marry.": "在他的兄弟中，斯特拉德看到了他所失去的一切。谢尔盖（Sergei）英俊年轻，而斯特拉德已经变老并满是伤疤。怨恨渐渐侵蚀了他们的关系，最终演变成了仇恨。斯特拉德心爱的塔提亚娜（Tatyana）拒绝了他，选择了谢尔盖，而她誓约要嫁给他。",
	"In a desperate attempt to win Tatyana's heart, Strahd forged a pact with dark powers that made him immortal. At the wedding of Sergei and Tatyana, he confronted his brother and killed him. Tatyana fled and flung herself from Ravenloft's walls. Strahd's guards, seeing him for a monster, shot him with arrows. But he did not die. He became a vampire-the first vampire, according to many sages.": "在绝望的情况下，为了赢得塔夏娜(Tatyana)的芳心，斯特拉德(Strahd)与黑暗力量达成了一项协议，使他成为不朽之人。在谢尔盖(Sergei)和塔夏娜的婚礼上，他与自己的兄弟对质并杀死了他。塔夏娜逃走并从拉文洛夫特(Ravenloft)的城墙上投身而下。斯特拉德的卫兵们将他视为怪物，向他射箭。但他并没有死去。据许多贤者说，他成为了第一位吸血鬼。",
	"In the centuries since his transformation, Strahd's lust for life and youth have only grown. He broods in his dark castle, cursing the living for stealing away what he lost, and never admitting his hand in the tragedy he created.": "自从他变身以来的几个世纪里，斯特拉德对生命和青春的渴望只增不减。他郁郁寡欢地呆在自己的黑暗城堡里，诅咒那些夺走他失去的东西的活人，却从不承认自己在制造悲剧中的作用。",
