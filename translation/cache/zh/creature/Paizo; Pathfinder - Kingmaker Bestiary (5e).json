Its fur is golden, sometimes with a silvery or russet tone depending on the metals it has ingested, and its claws are always the shiny black of seasoned iron.": "黄金猛兽是高度攻击性和领土性的掠食者，它们用八只腿疾跑，利用强大的力量和坚硬的爪子穿透坚硬的石头。一只典型的黄金猛兽只有3英尺长，但重量超过200磅，因为它的坚固骨骼密集地包裹着肌肉，使得这种生物非常强壮，但是臭名昭著地不擅长游泳。它的毛皮呈金色，有时带有银色或赤褐色的色调，取决于它摄入的金属，而它的爪子总是闪亮的黑色，就像经过磨练的铁一样。",
	"These stats represent an avatar of the Lantern King, the Eldest of trickery. The actual Lantern King would be a much more powerful foe in the CR range of 28–29, but using his avatar allows you to pit him against 20th-level PCs without overwhelming them entirely.": "这些数据代表了灯王的分身，欺诈之神中最古老的存在。实际的灯王将是一个更强大的对手，其挑战等级范围在28-29之间，但使用他的分身可以让你将他与20级PC对抗，而不会完全压倒他们。",
	"Avinash Jurrg is the general of Pitax's armies, and in many ways can be considered to be the second-in-command of the nation of Pitax. His unusual heritage makes him a great choice for the final boss of a long-running campaign of your own design, perhaps as the leader of an army of monsters that has been menacing the region for years.": "阿维纳什·朱尔格（Avinash Jurrg）是皮塔克（Pitax）军队的将军，从许多方面来看，他可以被视为皮塔克国家的副手。他不寻常的血统使他成为你自己设计的长期运行战役的终极boss的绝佳选择，也许作为多年来一直威胁该地区的怪物军队的领袖。",
	"Similar to how their kin, {@creature purple worm|MM|purple worms}, burrow through deep underground reaches, azure worms wallow and dig through soggy marshlands and deep bogs. Equally at home in any sort of watery environment, azure worms prefer to lie in wait to ambush prey rather than travel to hunt. Both ends of the dreadful azure worm are equally frightening: one features an immense, cavernous maw filled with dozens of sharp fangs, while the other supports a lance-like stinger that secretes a dangerous poison.": "与他们的同族{@creature purple worm|MM|purple worms}一样，蓝色蠕虫在潮湿的沼泽地和深深的泥潭中挖洞翻滚。在任何水域环境中都能游刃有余，蓝色蠕虫更喜欢埋伏等待猎物而不是主动出击。可怕的蓝色蠕虫两端同样令人恐惧：一端有一个巨大的洞口，里面布满了数十颗锋利的尖牙，另一端则有一个像长矛般的刺，分泌出一种危险的毒液。",
	"Bandersnatches are consummate hunters, and only the deadliest predators or the most cunning intelligent prey offer them sport. Once a bandersnatch has marked a creature for death, it runs it to ground without fear, rest, or remorse.": "班德斯纳奇是卓越的猎手，只有最致命的捕食者或最狡猾的智慧猎物才能给它们带来挑战。一旦班德斯纳奇将某个生物标记为死亡目标，它将毫不畏惧、不停歇、没有怜悯地追踪并击倒它。",

	"With their long, thorny tongues, these wyverns serve as the favored pets of the nymph queen {@creature Nyrissa|PKB}. As natives of the First World, they are only rarely encountered on the Material Plane. They appear similar to the typical wyvern, save that they have extraordinarily long, barbed tongues that they can use to lash out at victims.

	"The mysterious blodeuwedds dwell in those parts of the world where the boundaries between the Material Plane and the First World have worn thin, or around portals between the two planes.

Some call these monsters \"puppet-master birds\" while others refer to them as \"shrill shrikes.\" Slightly smarter than the typical animal, cauthoojes are canny enough to avoid drawing too much attention to themselves and prefer to prey upon lone travelers than pick off meals from the fringes of towns or villages.

Some of these cultists are solitary members of groups with influence throughout the world, while others, such as the Cultists of the Bloom, are entirely regional threats.": "就像强盗们被吸引到了被盗之地一样，各种异教徒也发现这个地区是藏身处和神祇的隐秘神龛的理想之地，这些神祇和半神的崇拜在大多数城镇中都被禁止。这些异教徒中有些是世界各地有影响力的团体的孤立成员，而另一些，比如(Stolen Lands)的异教徒，是完全地区性的威胁。",
	"Note that these cultists, along with the more powerful specialized cultists presented later in this book under the entry for {@book Thresholders|PKB|2|Thresholders} (page 94), can be used together as different agents of a sprawling sect of sinister worshippers in your game simply by changing their descriptions to match whatever nefarious deity or evil faith you've decided they might serve.": "请注意，这些异教徒，以及本书后面在{@book Thresholders|PKB|2|Thresholders}（第94页）条目下呈现的更强大的专门异教徒，可以作为一个庞大邪恶崇拜者教派的不同代理一起在你的游戏中使用，只需通过改变他们的描述来匹配你决定他们可能侍奉的邪恶神明或信仰。",
	"This unusual bear guards a long-forgotten shrine of Erastil. You can present the guardian as cursed by other faiths by simply changing the nature of its Accursed weakness so that worshippers of other faiths gain advantage against it.

	"Daemons are sinister neutral evil fiends who form from the most despicable of souls and personify the most horrible ways one can die. Natives to the neutral evil outer planes, daemons lack the strict order and regiment associated with devils, yet also lack the almost gleeful addiction to spreading chaos and mayhem common to demons. They are, many scholars posit, one of the purest forms of evil. Daemons as a whole cover a wide range of power, and many are associated with the legendary demigods known collectively as the Horsemen of the Apocalypse.": "恶魔是邪恶中立的邪恶恶魔，它们由最卑劣的灵魂形成，体现了人们可能遭遇的最可怕的死亡方式。作为邪恶中立外部位面的本地生物，恶魔缺乏与恶魔相关的严格秩序和纪律，但也缺乏恶魔普遍具有的对传播混乱和暴乱的几乎狂喜的瘾。许多学者认为，它们是邪恶的最纯粹形式之一。恶魔整体上涵盖了广泛的力量范围，许多恶魔与众所周知的被称为《启示录》四骑士的传奇半神有关。",
	"Not all cult leaders are clerics invested with the power of a god, and one does not need divine spellcasting to devote their life to a higher power. Darivan is a perfect example as he is a powerful sorcerer who received visions from Lamashtu that compelled him to found the Cult of the Bloom. You can use Darivan's stats for any cult leader associated with some sort of life-giving source of vitality; simply rename his Bloom Regeneration ability as needed and swap out his languages and alignment as appropriate to fit the new role.": "并非所有邪教领袖都是被授予神的力量的牧师，一个人不需要神术来奉献自己的生命给更高的力量。达里万(Darivan)就是一个完美的例子，他是一位强大的巫师，接受了来自拉玛舒图(Lamashtu)的启示，迫使他创建了“绽放邪教”(Cult of the Bloom)。您可以使用达里万的属性来塑造任何与某种赋予生命力量的邪教领袖；只需根据需要重新命名他的“绽放再生”(Bloom Regeneration)能力，并根据新角色的需要调整他的语言和立场。",
	"Davik Nettles rose from death as a unique undead creature, and now haunts the site of his murder as a relentless force. If you choose to use these statistics to represent an entirely new category of undead monster, you'll want to adjust the specifics of Davik's rejuvenation to match the lore you build for them. For example, you might create a \"river revenant,\" an undead creature known to haunt the shore of the waterway where it was murdered. Swapping out his ranseur for other types of weapons is another easy way to adjust this stat block to fit other cultures or types of descriptive flavor.": "戴维克·奈特尔斯（Davik Nettles）从死亡中复活，成为一种独特的不死生物，现在在他被谋杀的地点游荡，成为一股无情的力量。如果你选择使用这些统计数据来代表一种全新类别的不死怪物，你需要调整戴维克的复活细节，以匹配你为它们建立的传说。例如，你可以创建一个“河流亡灵”，一种众所周知的不死生物，它在被谋杀的水道岸边游荡。将他的长矛替换为其他类型的武器是调整这个属性块以适应其他文化或描述风格的另一种简单方法。",
	"Nymphs are well known as protectors of nature, but the defaced naiad nymphs who dwell in Thousandbreaths have been corrupted by the cruelty and bitterness of their queen, {@creature Nyrissa|PKB}. While they carry a deep, almost debilitating shame at their role in her House at the Edge of Time, their deadly powers more than offset this disadvantage in most combats. While they remain beautiful, their empty eye sockets and despondent voices lay bare the tragic truth of their existence.": "仙女们以保护自然而闻名，但居住在千息之地的被毁容的{@creature Nyrissa|PKB}女仙却被她们女王的残忍和苦涩腐蚀。虽然她们对自己在时间边缘之宅中的角色感到深深的羞耻，但她们致命的力量在大多数战斗中弥补了这一劣势。尽管她们依然美丽，但空洞的眼眶和沮丧的声音揭示了她们存在的悲惨真相。",
	"Derghodaemons represent death through unfathomable violence and being eaten alive. Derghodaemons look like walking masses of razor-sharp insect claws connected to equally menacing chitinous limbs.

	"Doprillus are hulking humanoid-shaped creatures with banded muscles who wear ornate masks at all times that fill their wearers with magical strength and fighting spirit. Despite their human-like frames, these creatures are without doubt alien in body and mind alike, particularly due to their plantlike manes of hair. Doprillus love to battle, especially by grappling, and are eager to start brawls. On neutral ground, a doprillu offers to duel the strongest-looking opponent, but when a doprillu's home turf is invaded, no rules apply to the confrontation. As befits the superheated blood that fuels them, doprillus make their homes in warm locations: hot jungles, sunny deserts, and underground caverns near sulfur vents.": "多普里鲁斯（Doprillus）是庞大的人形生物，肌肉有条纹，他们始终戴着华丽的面具，这些面具能赋予佩戴者魔法力量和战斗精神。尽管他们的身形类似人类，但这些生物在身体和思维上无疑是外星的，尤其是因为他们像植物一样的鬃毛。多普里鲁斯喜欢战斗，尤其是格斗，他们渴望开始斗殴。在中立地带，多普里鲁斯会提出与看起来最强壮的对手决斗，但当多普里鲁斯的家园遭到入侵时，对决就没有规则可言。为了适应他们燃烧的热血，多普里鲁斯选择在温暖的地方定居：炎热的丛林、阳光普照的沙漠和靠近硫磺喷口的地下洞穴。",

	"Drainberry bushes are floating plants that originate from the First World, with long, thorny vines and dense clusters of bright-red berries. Their hollow thorns quickly siphon blood, which is how these carnivorous plants feed, and they rapidly turn consumed blood into fresh batches of delicious berries. Drainberry bushes exude a faint white glow that is a result of stored positive energy. Drainberry bushes exhibit unusually high intelligence and have an astute sense of value. They typically become insulted when creatures attempt to harvest their berries. Creatures that attempt to converse with drainberry bushes find that the plants telepathically convey only short and simple phrases such as, \"Money please,\" \"Deal good,\" \"Deal no good,\" \"Want that,\" (with a gesture toward an item it covets), \"Thank you, customer,\" and if necessary, \"No refunds.\" Though a drainberry bush considers the market value of its berries to be 250 gp each, it greatly prefers interesting art objects as payment— even ones of significantly lower value.": "吸血莓灌木是一种漂浮植物，起源于第一世界，长有长长的带刺藤蔓和密集的鲜红浆果。它们空心的刺迅速吸取血液，这就是这些食肉植物获取养分的方式，它们迅速将吸收的血液转化为新鲜批次的美味浆果。吸血莓灌木散发出微弱的白光，这是存储的正能量的结果。吸血莓灌木表现出异常高的智慧，并具有敏锐的价值观。当生物试图收获它们的浆果时，它们通常会感到受到侮辱。试图与吸血莓灌木交谈的生物会发现，这些植物只能通过心灵感应传达简短而简单的短语，比如“请给钱”，“交易好”，“交易不好”，“想要那个”（并指向它觊觎的物品），“谢谢，顾客”，以及必要时的“不退款”。尽管吸血莓灌木认为其浆果的市场价值为每个250金币，但它更喜欢有趣的艺术品作为支付方式，即使价值明显较低。",
	"These menacing spiritual remnants of wicked warlords or bloodthirsty generals are towering specters of shadow and death. Like other wraiths, dread wraiths haunt the shadowy places of the world, but dread wraiths are more likely to travel greater distances to sow terror or amass influence, often sticking to dark glades or sinister ruins when journeying across sun-dappled lands. Dread wraiths tends to be arrogant and rarely form a pack with others of their kind, preferring instead to dominate groups of ordinary wraiths.": "这些凶恶的灵魂残留物可能是邪恶的军阀或嗜血的将军，它们是高大的阴影和死亡的幽灵。和其他幽灵一样，惧怖幽灵出没于世界的阴暗之地，但它们更有可能走得更远，散播恐怖或积累影响力，通常在穿越阳光普照的土地时，它们会停留在黑暗的林地或邪恶的废墟中。惧怖幽灵往往傲慢自大，很少与同类结成群体，而更倾向于统治普通幽灵的群体。",
	"The soldiers who guard Fort Drelev were hand-picked not only for their skill with the longsword and longbow, but for their personalities. Hannis Drelev wanted guards that would inspire fear as much as loyalty from his citizens.": "在德雷列夫要塞驻守的士兵不仅凭借他们精湛的长剑和长弓技艺被精心挑选，还因为他们的个性。汉尼斯·德雷列夫希望他的卫兵不仅能够激发市民的忠诚，也能够让他们感到畏惧。",
	"Dweomercats are magically gifted, four-eyed felines from the First World, where they prey upon other creatures and feed upon their primal energy.

Dweomercats have dark purple fur that is decorated with spirals and curls of lighter blue stripes that almost seem to form magical runes in their patterns. Dweomercats are famous for their ability to twist the metaphorical strings of spells cast on or near them, which they can transform into their own defensive magic or tap into to instantly teleport across the battlefield.": "魔猫是来自第一世界的具有魔法天赋的四眼猫科动物，在那里它们捕食其他生物并吸取它们的原始能量。它们经常出现在物质位面上与第一世界之间的界限薄弱的地区，或者在魔法被扭曲无法修复的地区。魔猫有着深紫色的毛皮，上面装饰着浅蓝色条纹的螺旋和卷曲图案，几乎看起来像是形成了魔法符文。魔猫以扭曲施加在它们身上或附近的法术的能力而闻名，它们可以将这些法术转化为自己的防御魔法，或者利用这些法术瞬间穿越战场。",
	"Tragedy spurs Ekundayo's overwhelming desire for revenge against all giants. Though not a distrustful person, Ekundayo rarely speaks. When he does, he is direct and to the point.

	"Elemental Tsunamis are dangerous foes. These powerful elementals are much sought-after as guardians by the most accomplished spellcasters, as they can typically only be called into service by a gate spell or relying upon similar, powerful magic. An elemental tsunami appears as a surging wave from which the upper torso, arms, and head of a powerful humanoid figure made of churning water and foam protrude.": "元素海啸是危险的敌人。这些强大的元素通常被最有成就的法师视为守护者，因为它们通常只能通过传送法术或依赖类似的强大魔法来召唤。一个元素海啸看起来像一股汹涌的浪潮，其中有一个由搅动的水和泡沫组成的强大人形身体的上半身、手臂和头部突出。",
	"While the cynical nickname locals have given Elga Verniex, the \"Old Beldame,\" fosters a much more sinister reputation than she actually embodies, she welcomes the privacy it brings her.

Nereids are a type of aquatic fey with deep ties to water. Although they are primarily aquatic creatures, their unique ability to imbue their vitality into a supernatural shawl allows them to travel on land as well. A nereid must be careful when manifesting a shawl, however, as their life essence is bound to it, so it can be stolen or destroyed to threaten the nereid. A nereid resembles a beautiful humanoid creature with long, pointed ears and webbed fingers.": "曾经是剑之守护者，{@i Briar}，海妖伊文德拉在剑被盗后被困多年。如果PC们能帮助她，她将成为强大的盟友。海妖是一种与水有着深刻联系的水中精灵。虽然它们主要是水生生物，但它们独特的能力可以将生命力注入超自然披肩中，使它们也能在陆地上移动。然而，海妖在显现披肩时必须小心，因为它们的生命精华与之绑定，所以披肩可能会被盗或摧毁，从而威胁到海妖。海妖类似于美丽的人形生物，长长的尖耳朵和蹼状手指。",

	"A fetch is a twisted, deviant simulacrum of a humanoid creature that exists or existed at one point on the Material Plane. Rumors of fetches that are reflections of entities from other planes persist, but none of these tales speak of fetches that duplicate anything other than a humanoid source. A fetch can manifest spontaneously when a powerful creature undergoes a significant emotional event or dies, either while on the First World or while in an area influenced significantly by the First World, but one can also be created by significant forces like the Eldest in order to torment and vex those who have annoyed them. While a fetch manifests from a soul's \"reflection,\" and as such bears a striking resemblance to that creature's appearance in life, a fetch has no true memories of its own.

	"A fetch is similar in appearance to the creature whose soul spawned it, save that it displays feylike features such as pointed ears, plantlike elements, or supernatural grace.

These weapons are highly versatile, and wounds created by them cause painful memories of past harm to augment their damage.": "一个取魂体在外表上与孕育它的生物相似，只是它展现出类似仙灵的特征，比如尖耳朵、植物元素或超自然的优雅。一个取魂体如果试图冒充一个仍然存活的源头，必须掩饰这些特征，并将其取魂武器表现为目标已知的武器。这些武器非常多才多艺，它们造成的伤口会引起过去伤害的痛苦记忆，增强它们的伤害。",

If using a ghostly guard in an encounter removed from the House at the Edge of Time, you should modify the source of their shame, or simply omit this weakness entirely.": "许多人认为，在时间边缘之屋的走廊中服务的幽灵卫士是不寻常的，因为幽灵通常起源于一个孤独的存在，其转变为不死之身是一个高度个性化和独特的过程。这些特定的幽灵同时从第一个王国{@creature Nyrissa|PKB}的毁灭中崛起，虽然他们已经为她服务了很长时间，但他们仍然对自己在随后所有王国的毁灭中所扮演的角色感到深深的羞耻。如果在时间边缘之屋之外的遭遇中使用幽灵卫士，您应该修改他们羞耻的来源，或者干脆省略这个弱点。",
	"In the Stolen Lands, hill giants are the most common of their kind. Small numbers of marsh giants can be found in the depths of Hooktongue Slough.": "在被盗领地中，山巨人是最常见的种类。少量的沼泽巨人可以在胡克通沼泽的深处找到。",
	"This animated object is a strange sight indeed—an apparently abstract statue made of more than a dozen stone orbs, several of which are hollow and feature openings that reveal the fires burning within them. When this statue animates, the orbs grind and roll against each other without separating but remain devoid of any obvious underlying support (almost as if the statue were an animated mass of spherical magnets). This statue is a depiction of the Outer God Yog-Sothoth, and can be found guarding any eldritch temple or location of interest to those who worship the so-called Lurker at the Threshold.": "这个动态物体确实是一个奇异的景象——看起来像是一个抽象的雕像，由十几个石球组成，其中几个是空心的，有开口显示出内部燃烧的火焰。当这个雕像活跃时，这些球体会相互摩擦和滚动，但不会分开，却没有明显的支撑（几乎就像是一个由球形磁铁组成的动态物体）。这个雕像是对外神约格·索托斯的描绘，可以在任何邪恶神殿或对那些崇拜所谓的“门槛潜伏者”的地点找到。",
	"Giant flytraps are immense creatures the size of trees, yet because they blend so well into the surrounding foliage, they remain deadly in an ambush.": "巨型捕蝇草是巨大的生物，有着树木般的体积，然而由于它们能够很好地融入周围的植被中，它们在伏击中仍然是致命的。",
	"These massive, primeval relatives of ordinary slugs squirm slowly through swamps and grasslands. Giant slugs are always voracious and prefer to eat flesh or plants high in water content. The mucus secreted by a giant slug is powerfully acidic and viscous. Wherever it travels, the creature leaves a trailing brown strip that kills most vegetation.": "这些庞大、原始的普通蛞蝓亲戚在沼泽和草地上缓慢蠕动。巨型蛞蝓总是贪婪的，更喜欢吃含水分丰富的肉或植物。巨型蛞蝓分泌的黏液具有强烈的酸性和粘性。无论它走到哪里，这种生物都会留下一条褐色的痕迹，杀死大部分植被。",
	"Giant slugs are the size of elephants, and while they move slowly, their predatory natures result in them moving more quickly than their much less dangerous normal-sized kin.": "巨型蛞蝓有着大象般的体积，虽然它们移动缓慢，但由于其捕食性质，使它们比它们危险得多的普通体型同类移动得更快。",
	"These blood-sucking parasites are common vectors for disease and other infections. Giant ticks are the size of a dog, and move about with surprising speed.": "这些吸血寄生虫是常见的疾病和其他感染的传播媒介。巨型蜱虫有着和狗一样大小，并且以惊人的速度移动。",
	"Bulkier than the typical giant spider, the giant trapdoor spider builds a pit in the ground and conceals its entrance with a cleverly camouflaged lid. It then lies in wait just below this trapdoor, ready to spring out and seize anything that comes too close.": "比典型的巨型蜘蛛更加庞大，巨型活板门蜘蛛在地面上挖一个坑并用巧妙伪装的盖子掩盖入口。然后它躺在这个活板门下面等待，随时准备跳出来抓住任何靠近的东西。",
	"Giant centipedes are flesh-eating myriapods that skitter with great speed through tunnels, forests, and similar densely packed terrain. Many are compact predators, but the giant whiptail centipede is anything but small. This creature can exceed lengths of 18 feet, but its slender and compact shape allows it to crawl through very narrow areas or coil into smaller spaces. The giant whiptail centipede is named for the twin whip-like extensions protruding from its already lengthy tail.": "巨型蜈蚣是食肉的多足动物，在隧道、森林和类似密集地形中以极快的速度蠕动。许多蜈蚣是紧凑的捕食者，但巨型鞭尾蜈蚣却一点也不小。这种生物的长度可以超过18英尺，但它纤细而紧凑的形状使其能够在非常狭窄的区域爬行或卷曲进入更小的空间。巨型鞭尾蜈蚣以其已经很长的尾部突出的两根鞭状延伸物而得名。",
	"Giant wolverines grow to the approximate size of horses and claim even more expansive territories than their more diminutive wolverine cousins. While a smaller wolverine will defend its prey from armed humanoids, a giant wolverine is unafraid to stalk and kill such creatures.": "巨型狼獾长到大约与马相当的大小，并拥有比它们更小的狼獾表兄弟更广阔的领地。虽然较小的狼獾会保卫其猎物免受武装人形生物的侵犯，但巨型狼獾却毫不畏惧地追踪并杀死这些生物。",

	"These mutant goblin dogs have batlike wings, and as they flop around in the air, their dander tends to dust out in clouds. The methods by which these particular goblin dogs grew their wings involved months of feeding on eldritch concoctions brewed from barghest blood.": "这些突变的地精狗长着蝙蝠般的翅膀，在空中飞来飞去时，它们的皮屑往往会在空中飞扬成云。这些特殊地精狗长出翅膀的方法包括数月来食用用从巴尔盖斯特血液酿制的奇异混合物。",
	"The theoretical leaders of goblin raids are commandos, but in practice these goblins rarely continue to lead their comrades once a battle begins. Most shirk their responsibilities in favor of wading into the fray in an attempt to claim more glory for themselves.": "哥布林突袭的理论领袖是突击队员，但实际上这些哥布林很少在战斗开始后继续领导他们的同伴。大多数为了为自己赢得更多荣耀而选择放弃责任，冲入混战中。",
	"Goblins' eponymous pets aren't true canines at all, but rather large, blunt-nosed rodents with thin bodies and long legs. Those who point out the legendary fear of dogs most goblins have might wonder why these creatures carry such a name, but as any goblin can tell you, goblin dogs represent what a real dog should be. All the rest are little more than monsters that are worthy of being killed on sight—or more often, a panicked retreat.": "哥布林的同名宠物实际上并非真正的犬类，而是体型庞大、鼻子钝、身体细长、腿长的啮齿类动物。那些指出大多数哥布林对狗类的传奇恐惧可能会想知道为什么这些生物会被称为狗，但任何一个哥布林都可以告诉你，哥布林犬才代表了真正的狗应该具备的特质。其他所有的犬类都不过是堪称怪物，值得立即击杀——或更常见的是，惊慌逃窜。",
	"As cowardly as they are ugly, a goblin dog prefers to lurk in bushes or deep shadows, pouncing on lone or wounded prey, although hunger or encouragement at the hand of goblin trainers can make them much more bold. Their patchy bald hides are constantly infested with rashes and dander.": "懦弱又丑陋，一只地精狗更喜欢潜伏在灌木丛或深处阴影中，突袭孤独或受伤的猎物，尽管饥饿或受到地精训练师的鼓励可能会使它们变得更加大胆。它们斑驳的光秃皮肤经常被皮疹和皮屑困扰。",
	"Some goblins take their people's affection of fire fully into the realm of deadly obsession. These pyromaniacs can be a great boon to a band of goblin raiders, but more often their presence is a double-edged sword; in the heat of the moment, goblin pyros sometimes lose sight of their tribe's goals and simply set fire to anything that will burn—including their own allies.": "一些地精将他们部落对火的喜爱完全发展成了致命的痴迷。这些纵火狂对一队地精袭击者来说可能是巨大的帮助，但更常见的情况是，他们的存在是一把双刃剑；在激动的时刻，地精纵火者有时会忽视部落的目标，只是随意点燃一切可以燃烧的东西，包括他们自己的盟友。",
	"While many goblins enjoy singing, goblin war chanters pride themselves on mastering the art of vocal performance. Their ballads and jingles tend to strike others as undeniably catchy, though whether they are actually enjoyable depends on the listener—and whether the goblin follows the performance up with an attack.": "虽然许多地精喜欢唱歌，地精战斗领唱者以精通声乐艺术为荣。他们的歌谣和小调往往让其他人觉得无可否认地动听，尽管它们是否真的令人愉悦取决于听众——以及地精是否在表演后发动攻击。",
	"A gogiteth is a slavering nightmare of teeth, eyes, and hairy spiderlike legs, and its appearance is invariably seared into the minds of any who witness it. Native to the Darklands, gogiteths are more intelligent than their appearance would suggest, yet they rarely put this intellect toward anything other than awfulness.": "一只戈吉特(gogiteth)是一只满嘴尖牙、眼睛和毛茸茸蜘蛛般的腿的噩梦，它的外表总是深深地烙印在任何见过它的人的脑海中。戈吉特(gogiteth)原产于黑暗地带，它们比外表所示的更聪明，但它们很少将这种智慧用于其他事情，而是用于恶行。",
	"The gogiteth's alien anatomy has inspired no shortage of speculative origin stories. Some believe they are a warp of a fleshwarping experiment gone horribly wrong, while others maintain that they could only have come to this world from some distant and fundamentally hostile planet.": "戈吉特(Gogiteth)的外星解剖启发了无数种推测性起源故事。有人认为它们是肉体扭曲实验失败的产物，而另一些人坚持认为它们只能来自某个遥远且根本敌对的星球。",
	"Grabbles is the leader of the mitflits who dwell under the Old Sycamore in the Stolen Lands, but works just as well as the leader of a band of any sort of group of gremlins if you wish. Alternately, he could be an unusual loner the PCs might encounter while exploring the wilderness; that rarest of mitflits who is powerful enough to make something of a life on their own. Though Grabbles is lawful evil, that doesn't mean he has to be used as a foe the PCs must fight. He could be given another alignment, or he could be used simply as a pathetic bully the PCs might attempt to redeem or forgive.": "格拉布尔斯（Grabbles）是生活在被窃取的土地上古老悬铃木下的米特弗利特（mitflits）首领，但如果你愿意，他同样适合作为任何类型的小精灵团体的领袖。或者，他也可以是PC们在探索荒野时可能会遇到的一个不寻常的独行者；那种罕见的米特弗利特，足够强大，可以独自过上一种生活。尽管格拉布尔斯是秩序邪恶，这并不意味着他必须被用作PC们必须对抗的敌人。他可以被赋予另一个阵营，或者他可以被简单地用作可怜的恃强凌弱者，PC们可能会试图拯救或宽恕他。",
	"Graveknights are undead warriors granted unlife by a cursed suit of armor. Most graveknights appear skeletal in appearance, and while one might think that the heavy armor they favor would obscure their true nature, most graveknights revel in the fact that they are skeletal horrors. Many wear armor that appears to be rusted, badly damaged, or incomplete, yet these features do not diminish their armor's ability to protect them in battle.": "墓地骑士是由一套被诅咒的盔甲赋予不死之身的战士。大多数墓地骑士看起来骷髅般，尽管人们可能认为他们喜欢的沉重盔甲会掩盖他们真正的本质，但大多数墓地骑士却乐此不疲地展示自己是骷髅恐怖的事实。许多人穿着看起来生锈、严重损坏或不完整的盔甲，然而这些特征并不减弱他们的盔甲在战斗中保护他们的能力。",
	"Even the lowliest of graveknights pose extreme danger to adventurers and are almost never encountered as less-powerful incarnations than those presented below.": "即使是最卑微的坟墓骑士对冒险者也构成极端危险，几乎不会以比下面所呈现的更弱小的形态出现。",
	"{@creature barghest|MPMM|Barghests} are ravenous gluttons of life who feed and grow on the fat of mortals, their bodies changing in ways none can predict as they use the flesh and blood of their victims to achieve grisly transformations into greater barghests. In their natural forms, {@creature barghest|MPMM|barghests} appear as a frighting cross between a wide-eared goblin and a hunched over hound, although instead of paws they have all-too-human hands. When a barghest becomes a greater barghest, it develops greater mutations such as vestigial arms, wings, or larger fangs, as its ties to the demon goddess Lamashtu deepen. Nargloom ({@i Kingmaker Companion Guide 66}) is a typical example of a greater barghest.": "{@creature barghest|MPMM|Barghests} 是生命的贪婪暴食者，它们以凡人的脂肪为食物并不断成长，利用受害者的血肉进行可怕的转变，变成更强大的巴尔戈斯，其变化无法预测。在它们的自然形态中，{@creature barghest|MPMM|barghests} 看起来像是宽耳的地精和驼背的猎犬的恐怖交叉，不过它们的脚掌却是人类的手。当一个巴尔戈斯变成更强大的巴尔戈斯时，它会发展出更大的变异，比如残肢、翅膀或更大的尖牙，因为它与恶魔女神拉玛舒图的联系加深。纳格鲁姆 ((Nargloom {@i Kingmaker Companion Guide 66})) 是更强大的巴尔戈斯的典型例子。",
	"Grigs are kindly musicians of the fey, often getting themselves into trouble due to their penchant for confronting evil well beyond their ability to vanquish. Even so, they fight bravely and with great cunning, using their magic and ranged sonic attacks while flying and leaping using their wings and powerful cricket-like lower torsos to stay out of reach. The grig's upper torsos appear humanoid, but their ears are long and pointed and they have a pair of gossamer dragonfly-like wings on their backs.": "矮精灵是仙界的善良音乐家，常因对抗超出自身能力范围的邪恶而陷入麻烦。即便如此，它们勇敢地战斗，极具狡诈，利用魔法和远程声波攻击，在飞行和跳跃时利用它们的翅膀和强壮的像蟋蟀一样的下半身保持距离。矮精灵的上半身看起来像人类，但它们的耳朵又长又尖，背上还有一对薄如蛛丝的蜻蜓翅膀。",
	"Grigori's role as a provocateur and spreader of propaganda makes him an enemy your players might love to hate, but his statistics can work just as well as the leader of a troupe of actors or a well-traveled entertainer. Adjust his alignment as needed.": "格里戈里（Grigori）作为一个煽动者和宣传者的角色，使他成为你的玩家可能会爱恨交加的敌人，但他的统计数据同样适用于一支演员团队的领导或一个经验丰富的表演者。根据需要调整他的立场。",
	"These violently murderous fey have one purpose: to stealthily hunt down and slay humanoids brazen enough to dare set foot in the wilderness. Though they prefer to hunt from the shadows, grimstalkers do not fear taking their grisly work to the very edges of civilization. This boldness serves as a reminder that nature can be cruel, capricious, and owes no debt to humanity. Grimstalkers are happy to perform nature's dirty work and particularly enjoy targeting loggers, hunters, and explorers, regardless of whether they respect the natural setting they work or travel within. These creatures are humanoid in shape, but with gaunt, hairless frames and mottled green and brown flesh that gives their skin the appearance of moss-draped bark. When damaged, they bleed a thick, sap-like blood.": "这些暴力凶残的精灵有一个目的：悄无声息地猎杀那些胆敢踏入荒野的人类。虽然它们更喜欢在阴影中狩猎，但恶魔追猎者并不畏惧将残忍的工作带到文明边缘。这种大胆行为提醒人们自然可以残酷、反复无常，并不欠人类任何债。恶魔追猎者乐于执行自然的肮脏工作，尤其喜欢瞄准伐木工、猎人和探险家，无论他们是否尊重他们工作或旅行的自然环境。这些生物呈人形，但身材消瘦，没有毛发，皮肤斑驳的绿色和棕色让它们的皮肤看起来像被苔藓覆盖的树皮。受伤时，它们会流出一种像树液般浓稠的血液。",
	"Grimstalkers generally do not associate with other fey; for the most part, they see their kin from the First World as cowards or weaklings, or perhaps both.": "Grimstalkers（阴影追猎者）通常不与其他精灵交往；在大多数情况下，他们认为来自第一世界的同类是懦夫或软弱者，或者两者兼而有之。",
	"Gromog isn't at his best when he's encountered, as threatening a party of adventures with an ogre during one of their first combats is far too dangerous! These statistics work well for a potential ogre ally the PCs encounter in a dungeon, perhaps a lumbering creature who's been left imprisoned in a cell for many months, or a hapless ogre who's been trapped in a cave by a collapse. In any event, he might have a change of heart and learn to be less awful after being rescued from his plight.": "当Gromog被遇到时，并不是处于最佳状态，因为在冒险队的一场早期战斗中威胁他们与食人魔，这太危险了！这些统计数据适用于PC在地牢中遇到的潜在食人魔盟友，也许是一个笨拙的生物，被囚禁在牢房里很多个月，或者是一个被坍塌困在洞穴里的可怜食人魔。无论如何，在被从困境中解救后，他可能会有所改变，学会变得不那么可怕。",

	"The normal guthallath is an enormous construct created long ago by ancient empires as war machines. The version of guthallath encountered in the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} has been described as an ancient robotic construction risen from a long-buried torpor in ancient Numerian badlands, but its statistics are the same, regardless of whether it was created by ancient magic or super science. A guthallath can be built in any shape, but the classic form is that of an immense humanoid giant.": "正常的古萨拉斯（Guthallath）是由古代帝国早期创造的巨大构造，作为战争机器。在{@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}中遇到的古萨拉斯版本被描述为一种古老的机械构造，从古代Numerian荒原中长埋的沉睡中复苏，但无论是由古代魔法还是超级科学创造，其统计数据都是相同的。古萨拉斯可以被建造成任何形状，但经典形式是一个巨大的人形巨人。",
	"The baron of Fort Drelev, Hannis is a proud and cruel man destined to become one of the primary antagonists moving against the PCs nation. These statistics work particularly well when used for the role of any petty tyrant or awful king you might wish to unleash upon the party.": "Fort Drelev的男爵，汉尼斯（Hannis）是一个骄傲而残忍的人，注定会成为针对PCs国家的主要对手之一。当你想要释放在派对上的任何小暴君或可怕国王时，这些统计数据特别适用。",

	"The dreaded hill giant butchers of Glenebon are much feared by other hill giants and adventurers alike, for they take great pleasure in stalking their prey until an opportunity to slice their victim to bits presents itself. Hill giant butchers struggle to hunt successfully in small groups and often succumb to internal bickering that leads quickly to deadly expressions of their violent compulsions, leaving only one survivor.": "格林邦（Glenebon）可怕的山岗巨人屠夫（Hill Giant Butchers）让其他山岗巨人和冒险者闻风丧胆，因为它们喜欢悄悄地追踪猎物，直到有机会将猎物切成碎片。山岗巨人屠夫在小团体中狩猎时往往很吃力，并经常陷入内部争吵，很快就会导致暴力冲动的致命表现，最终只留下一个幸存者。",
	"These three hill giants {@homebrew (Darg, Fesl, and Urda)} seek to take advantage of the growing instability in the Stolen Lands as the threat of war escalates.

	"Very few hobgoblins live in the Stolen Lands; those that do tend to be mercenaries seeking work far afield from their homes, as is the case for the hobgoblin archers found working for the troll warlord Hargulka.

Their backs sport dozens of long spines that run from their snouts all the way down the length of their powerful tails. Their wide mouths are full of sharp and twisted rows of teeth not unlike those of a shark. The hodags' rough, scaly hides carry hues of green and brown, allowing them to blend into their forest surroundings where they ambush prey.

The jabberwock hails from the fey realm of the First World and is part of a group of powerful First World creatures known collectively as the Tane. That the so-called \"lesser jabberwocks\" are still among the most powerful creatures from the First World speaks volumes to the danger a true jabberwock presents. Regardless of its level of power, a jabberwock appears the same as a long-necked, four-legged reptilian creature with immense teeth, large wings, bulging yellow eyes, and a long draconic tail.": "在许多文化中，很少有野兽像这种奇异的龙类生物一样，激发了如此多的传说、诗歌、歌曲和神话。贾伯沃克来自第一世界的精灵境界，是一群强大的第一世界生物中的一员，被统称为塔恩(`Tane`)。所谓的“次级贾伯沃克”仍然是来自第一世界中最强大的生物之一，这足以说明真正的贾伯沃克所带来的危险。无论它的力量水平如何，贾伯沃克看起来都像是一只长颈、四条腿的爬行动物，有着巨大的牙齿、大翅膀、突出的黄色眼睛和一条长长的龙尾。",
	"The hags of the Jaggedbriar coven are named Eltrid, Irova, and Vikara. These annis hags seek to enhance their ability to use lesser planar ally with their coven magic. Used singularly, though, this stat block can represent a single annis hag with a slightly different set of spell-like abilities. The Jaggedbriar hag's ability to charm monsters makes a viable foe for use as a diabolical mastermind in your game.": "锯齿荆棘女巫团的女巫分别是艾尔特里德(Eltrid)、伊洛瓦(Irova)和维卡拉(Vikara)。这些安妮斯女巫希望通过女巫团魔法增强她们使用次级位面盟友的能力。然而，单独使用时，这个属性块可以代表一个具有略有不同法术样式的单个安妮斯女巫。锯齿荆棘女巫的迷惑怪物能力使其成为您游戏中可用作邪恶主谋的可行敌人。",
	"Jamandi serves as one of the first of the PCs' allies: the dueling aristocrat who gathers and recruits the PCs (among others) for the drive to explore and settle the wilderness of the Stolen Lands. Her stats work well for any well-known or even infamous duelist—perhaps a scoundrel who's eager to test her mettle against a PC in a public battle.": "贾曼迪(Jamandi)是PC们的第一个盟友之一：作为一位决斗贵族，她集结并招募PC们（以及其他人），共同探索和开拓被盗之地(Stolen Lands)的荒野。她的属性适合任何著名甚至臭名昭著的决斗者——也许是一位渴望在公开战斗中与PC们一决高下的恶棍。",
	"Jin Durwhimmer met his fate in a remote cave in the eastern Stolen Lands while investigating a mysterious link to the First World. As with the other ghosts presented in this chapter, Jin works best when you include him in a plotline that supports his themes, but you can also simply use these stats as a basis for a new type of incorporeal undead that rises from the bodies of druids who lost their faith.": "金·德沃海默(Jin Durwhimmer)在东部被窃取的土地的一个偏远洞穴中遇到了他的命运，当时他正在调查与第一世界的神秘联系。与本章中介绍的其他幽灵一样，金最适合在支持他主题的情节中使用，但你也可以简单地使用这些属性作为一个新型的从失去信仰的德鲁伊的尸体中升起的无实体不死生物的基础。",
	"Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors who prowl frigid moors, marshes, and wastelands. While a jotund troll's nine heads possess their own brains and senses, they work much more in tandem than the dual-minded nature of the two-headed troll. Despite this, the heads often argue and bicker, particularly over which head gets to eat the carcass of a victim. The fact that all nine maws lead to the same shared stomach seldom makes much difference in these culinary disagreements.": "冰巨洞(trolls)是巨大的、九头的恐怖生物，它们徘徊在寒冷的沼泽地和荒原上。虽然冰巨洞(troll)的九个头拥有各自的大脑和感官，但它们的协作程度远远超过双头巨洞(troll)的双重思维性质。尽管如此，这些头经常争吵和争执，特别是在确定哪个头可以吃掉受害者的尸体时。事实上，所有九个嘴巴通向同一个共享的胃很少在这些烹饪争议中起到作用。",
	"Jubilost Narthropple is a gnome of many words, often spoken in multiple languages and laden with biting observations and veiled insults. Jubilost would have others believe he's well-traveled, but when the PCs first meet him, the majority of his adventures consist of those imagined while reading books in the safety of his home.": "朱比洛斯特·纳斯罗普尔(Jubilost Narthropple)是一个多话的侏儒，经常使用多种语言讲话，言辞尖刻，带有隐晦的侮辱。朱比洛斯特希望别人相信他已经游历过很多地方，但当玩家角色(PCs)第一次遇到他时，他大部分的冒险都是在家中安全地阅读书籍时想象出来的。",
	"When the PCs encounter Jurgrindor, the frost giant has been wounded severely. These stats can serve for any frost giant prisoner the PCs might encounter, or if (as in the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}) you narratively need to have a low-level party encounter what's normally a much more powerful foe. Alternatively, you can use a mechanic like Wounded Arm to make any other powerful foe more usable at lower levels, as long as you work to adjust the creature's statistics so that they aren't unfair in a fight at your target challenge rating.": "当PCs遇到尤格林多(Jurgrindor)时，这位冰霜巨人已经受了严重伤。这些属性可以用于PCs可能遇到的任何冰霜巨人囚犯，或者（如在{@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}中）你叙述上需要让一个实力更强的敌人与一个低级队伍相遇。或者，你可以使用类似受伤的手臂(Wounded Arm)这样的机制，使得其他强大的敌人在较低级别时更易使用，只要你努力调整生物的统计数据，使得它们在你设定的挑战等级下的战斗中不会不公平。",
	"Kargstaad is a four-armed frost giant from the First World—one of the nymph queen {@creature Nyrissa|PKB|Nyrissa's} favored minions. You can explain his four arms any way you wish in your games, of course—perhaps he was influenced by Abyssal energies, was granted his extra arms as a boon from his deity, or was exposed to strange alchemical pollution. You could even have him possess only two arms when first encountered by the party, only to grow the extra two during combat at a suitably dramatic moment.": "卡格斯塔德(Kargstaad)是来自第一世界的四臂霜巨人，是仙女女王{@creature Nyrissa|PKB|Nyrissa's}青睐的手下之一。当然，在游戏中，你可以以任何你喜欢的方式解释他的四只手臂——也许他受到深渊能量的影响，被他的神赐予额外的手臂作为恩赐，或者暴露在奇怪的炼金污染之下。你甚至可以让他在被冒险队伍首次遇到时只有两只手臂，然后在战斗中在一个适当戏剧性的时刻长出额外的两只手臂。",
	"These brutal frost giants are not native to the Stolen Lands, and come to the region only once {@creature Nyrissa|PKB|Nyrissa's} realm of Thousandbreaths begins to bloom throughout the kingdom. While these frost giants are natives to the First World, they can just as easily serve as a frost giant leader or powerful frost giant fighter elsewhere in the world.": "这些残暴的霜巨人并非生于被窃领土，只有当{@creature Nyrissa|PKB|Nyrissa's}千息之境开始在整个王国中绽放时，它们才会来到这个地区。虽然这些霜巨人是第一世界的本地居民，但它们同样可以在世界其他地方担任霜巨人领袖或强大的霜巨人战士。",
	"These graveknights have in their genesis an element of tragedy, for they came to be from a group of Pharasmin crusaders who gave up their lives and souls to carry on their fight against a cult of Yog-Sothoth worshippers known as the Thresholders, but you can use these graveknights for any encounter that requires a particularly powerful, frozen foe.": "这些重甲骑士的起源中蕴含着悲剧因素，因为它们是由一群放弃生命和灵魂继续与被称为门限者的尤格索托斯崇拜者战斗的法拉斯教徒十字军转变而来的，但你可以将这些重甲骑士用于任何需要特别强大、冰冻的敌人的遭遇。",
	"The kobold sorcerer Kereek works alongside his friend and ally {@creature Prazil|PKB} as a spy for the troll warlord {@creature Hargulka|PKB}. Kereek is strong for a kobold—he can serve as the leader of a kobold warren in your game, or as a member of a monstrously themed rival adventuring party.": "狗头人巫师凯瑞克与他的朋友兼盟友{@creature Prazil|PKB}一起为巨魔军阀{@creature Hargulka|PKB}充当间谍。凯瑞克是一只强壮的狗头人，他可以在你的游戏中担任狗头人兽穴的领袖，或者作为一个以怪物为主题的对手冒险队伍的成员。",
	"The leader of a band of notorious hill giants, Kob Moleg's alliance with the king of Pitax forces him into conflict with the PCs' kingdom when war between the two nations begins. Kob Moleg is so much more powerful than the standard hill giant that he arguably works better as a unique foe in a campaign than just a clan leader—perhaps he might serve as the primary ruler of all hill giants in an entire region in your game.": "一群臭名昭著的山岭巨人的领袖，科布·莫勒格(Kob Moleg)与皮塔克国王的联盟使他在两国开战时不得不与PC王国发生冲突。科布·莫勒格比标准山岭巨人强大得多，可以说他在战役中更适合作为一个独特的敌人，而不仅仅是一个氏族领袖——也许他可以在你的游戏中作为整个地区所有山岭巨人的主要统治者。",
	"Kobolds are small, reptilian humanoids who carry physical resemblances to dragons. They have blunt snouts and horns, and their scale coloration varies through all the colors associated with the various types of true dragon.": "狗头人是小型、类似爬行动物的人形生物，它们在外观上与龙有些相似。它们有钝头和角，鳞片的颜色与各种真龙类型相关的所有颜色都有所不同。",
	"Kobold scouts serve as trapsetters, explorers, and guardians for their warrens. Quick and agile, they tend to avoid combat if possible. When presented with no other choice, a kobold scout fights dirty, ducking in and out of combat to catch a foe unaware rather than preferring to stand and fight.": "狗头人侦察兵(Kobold scouts)在他们的兽穴中充当陷阱设置者、探险者和守卫。他们敏捷迅速，通常会尽量避免战斗。当别无选择时，狗头人侦察兵会采取卑鄙手段进行战斗，时而进入战斗，时而退出，以捕捉敌人的不备，而不是选择站在原地战斗。",
	"Once a faithful worshipper of Pharasma, Korog abandoned his faith and his life as a sacrifice to continue to oppose the works of his brother, the cultist {@creature Foras|PKB}. Of course, in your game, Korog works well as the undead leader of any necromantic army you might create, or as the reanimated legacy of an ancient foe from the past.": "曾是法拉斯玛（Pharasma）的忠实信徒，科罗格（Korog）放弃了他的信仰和生命，作为继续反对他的兄弟，邪教徒{@creature Foras|PKB}的牺牲。当然，在你的游戏中，科罗格可以作为任何你可能创建的亡灵军队的领袖，或者作为过去一位古老敌人的复活传奇。",
	"Kressle leads a group known as the Thorn River bandits, and is in the process of becoming a part of the {@creature Stag Lord|PKB|Stag Lord's} greater plan.

	"Krooths, sometimes called crocodile eaters, are fast and vicious bogland hunters. While they are known to hunt and eat large predators, they tend to also prey upon lizardfolk, boggards, and dinosaurs. Indeed, a krooth looks vaguely like a dinosaur, with its ridged head frill, long spiky tail, and mouth full of sharp teeth.": "克鲁斯（Krooths），有时被称为鳄鱼食者，是快速而凶猛的沼泽猎手。虽然它们以猎杀和吞食大型掠食者而闻名，但它们也倾向于捕食蜥蜴人、泥蛙人和恐龙。事实上，克鲁斯看起来有点像恐龙，它们有着有褶皱的头饰、长长的带刺尾巴和满是锋利牙齿的嘴巴。",
	"Kundal is a hunter with a secret: he's a werewolf. Kundal makes for a great foe, especially if you take time in your game to establish him as a member of society before the truth comes out. You can also use his stats to represent the average member of a band of nomadic warriors who have become lycanthropes.": "坤达尔（Kundal）是一个猎人，他有一个秘密：他是一只狼人。坤达尔是一个很好的敌人，特别是如果你在游戏中花时间将他塑造成社会的一员，然后真相大白。你也可以使用他的属性来代表一群游牧战士中的普通成员，他们已经变成了狼人。",

	"The Leng envoy is a powerful variant of the dangerous denizen of Leng. The envoy is typically found beyond Leng's borders when called there by a powerful cultist who seeks aid in breaking down the boundaries of reality. They often travel with their own deadly minions, such as {@creature Mastiff of Tindalos|PKB|mastiffs of Tindalos} (page 57). A Leng envoy is humanoid in shape, yet its face is a nightmare tangle of strange mouth-parts topped by a pair of twisted horns. Unlike the typical denizen of Leng, these envoys rarely bother to conceal their appearances from those they visit on the Material Plane.": "冷格使者是冷格危险居民的强大变种。当被强大的邪教徒召唤以帮助打破现实界的界限时，使者通常会出现在冷格的边界之外。他们经常与自己的致命手下一起旅行，比如{@creature Mastiff of Tindalos|PKB|mastiffs of Tindalos}（第57页）。冷格使者呈人形，但面部是一团噩梦般的奇怪口器，顶部有一对扭曲的角。与典型的冷格居民不同，这些使者很少费心向他们在物质位面上拜访的人隐藏自己的外表。",
	"Lerritans are unstoppable humanoid behemoths with skin of volcanic glass and blood of roiling lava. These malicious arsonists would see the world burned to a cinder. They pay homage to Ymeri, the evil elemental demigod of fire, and they bully other fiery creatures. When the urge to immolate grows too great to ignore, lerritans burn forests, destroy villages, and boil rivers, but they avoid large bodies of water. A typical lerritan wields a molten warhammer, and their hunched-over stance only makes the churning, smoking, volcano-like ridge between their shoulders stand out more.": "熔岩人(Lerritans)是无法阻挡的人形巨兽，他们的皮肤如火山玻璃，血液如沸腾的岩浆。这些恶毒的纵火犯希望看到世界化为灰烬。他们向着伊梅丽(Ymeri)致敬，这位邪恶的火元素半神，他们欺凌其他火焰生物。当焚烧的冲动变得无法忽视时，熔岩人会烧毁森林，摧毁村庄，煮沸河流，但他们会避开大片水域。典型的熔岩人手持着一把熔化的战锤，他们驼背的姿势只会更凸显出肩膀之间那个翻腾、冒烟、像火山一样的脊脊。",
	"The vile and vicious offspring of a demon lord and a species of hyenas, leucrottas are intelligent and cruel beasts. They use their astounding vocal mimicry to lure unsuspecting creatures near so that they can torment then devour them. Leucrottas measure 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh 800 pounds, and they are perpetually filthy. A leucrotta's oversized jaws are lined with rows of jagged, hardened bony ridges rather than teeth, and it can shear through flesh, bone, and even steel with ease. They have long legs that end in sharp hooves and badger-like visages.": "恶毒而凶残的(leucrottas)是恶魔领主和鬣狗类物种的后代。它们是聪明而残忍的野兽。它们利用惊人的声音模仿能力引诱毫无戒心的生物靠近，以便折磨并吞食它们。它们的肩高达5英尺，体重800磅，且常年肮脏不堪。(leucrotta)的巨大下颚上长满了一排排锯齿状、硬化的骨脊，而不是牙齿，它们可以轻松地切割肉、骨甚至钢铁。它们有着长长的腿，脚底是尖利的蹄子，面容有点像獾。",
	"These skull-headed, vulture-winged daemons are manifestations of evil souls who perished from disease in life. They work tirelessly to spread disease across all the worlds of the multiverse.

In your game, though, he can perhaps achieve his goal of being the boss himself, rather than serving someone else.": "草舔者(Lickweed)本想成为自己的地精部落或战队的领袖，但命运对他另有安排。然而，在你的游戏中，他或许可以实现自己成为老大的目标，而不是为别人服务。",
	"The powerful, serpentine beings known as linnorms might be related distantly to the more well-known dragons, but their draconic physiologies are where any such similarities end. Whereas true dragons boast incredible intellectual capabilities and far-reaching plans, linnorms are driven only by their insatiable hunger and desire to inflict cruelty on others. Linnorms are exceptionally difficult to outwit due to their strong wills, and it's not wise to try bargaining with them— when faced with one of these legendary beasts, one's best option is flight, pure and simple. Failing that, a noble death remains a viable back-up plan.": "被称为巨蛇的强大蛇形生物可能与更为人熟知的龙有一定的关联，但它们的龙类生理构造是任何相似之处的终点。真正的龙拥有令人难以置信的智力能力和遥远的计划，而巨蛇只被它们无尽的饥饿和对他人施加残忍的欲望所驱使。由于它们坚强的意志，巨蛇极其难以智胜，因此与它们讨价还价是不明智的——当面对这些传奇生物之一时，最好的选择是逃跑，简单明了。如果失败，一死也是一种高贵的备选方案。",
	"The dust mephit Lintwerth is the familiar of {@creature Imeckus Stroon|PKB} in the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}.

	"The storyteller Linzi left her birthplace in Galt years ago to seek a higher education in the arts in fabled Pitax, but it wasn't long before she arrived in that town that she realized the accolades and fame surrounding the region's artistic triumphs more resembled hearsay and propaganda. While she could sense that the city's artisans were struggling to produce actual works of art, the overwhelming regime of suppression and meddling put in place by {@creature Castruccio Irovetti|PKB|King Irovetti} made that difficult at best. As a result, Linzi's time in Pitax fostered more a sense of resistance and rebellion within her than actual inspiration for her stories.

She felt she'd learned all she could from artisans in Pitax and headed east with a new goal: to find a notable hero or heroes who could serve as her muse, as inspiration for what she felt would be her masterpiece: a gripping tale of adventuring triumph in the face of starkest evil.

	"The lizardfolk of the Stolen Lands tend to keep to themselves, but when a violent overlord seizes control they can be worked into a dangerous frenzy.

A social structure, even one in which they are bullied or demeaned, partially fills their need for some type of companionship, and they rarely rebel or against their fellows unless their rage hits a breaking point from which there can be no return.": "在所有类型的小鬼中，(%num%)中的米特弗利特对魔法的亲和力最低，大部分已经失去了祖先小鬼的能力。他们在世界上的其他基本生物中寻找伴侣，并与蜘蛛、蜈蚣和洞穴中的昆虫建立友谊的纽带，这些似乎是唯一愿意接受他们的生物。社会结构，即使在这种结构中他们受到欺凌或贬低，也在一定程度上满足了他们对某种类型伴侣的需求，他们很少反抗或反对同伴，除非他们的愤怒达到了无法挽回的破裂点。",
	"The weight of murder wears heavy on the soul. With souls marked by a lifetime of dealing death, these killers, whether mass murderers, bloodthirsty soldiers, or sadistic executioners, sometimes do not let judgment and lawful execution stanch their slaying sprees. When such individuals are brought to justice, they might rise after death as mohrgs to continue their work, transforming into skeletal horrors to which strips of decayed meat and unsettlingly writhing entrails cling. The spiny length of gristle and muscle that extends from their jaws like a long tongue is, though, their most disturbing feature.": "谋杀的重量深深地压在灵魂上。这些杀手的灵魂被一生中的死亡所标记，无论是大规模杀手、嗜血士兵还是残忍的刽子手，有时候并不会让审判和合法执行阻止他们的杀戮狂潮。当这样的个体被绳之以法时，他们可能在死后升起为(`mohrgs`)继续他们的工作，变成骷髅恐怖，腐烂的肉条和令人不安的蠕动内脏附着在上面。从他们的下颚延伸出来的多刺的肌腱和肌肉，像一根长长的舌头，然而，这是他们最令人不安的特征。",

	"Be they hunters who have traveled far from their home to chase down legendary prey, or members of a small gathering like the Six Bears, monster-hunting warriors find no shortage of targets to track and hunt in the Stolen Lands. Monster hunters might also resent wandering adventurers, who might kill a targeted monster before the hunters have a chance.": "无论是从家乡远道而来追逐传说中猎物的猎人，还是像六熊小组那样的成员，怪物猎人在被窃领地里找不到缺乏追踪和狩猎的目标。怪物猎人可能会对四处闲逛的冒险者感到不满，因为这些冒险者可能会在猎人有机会之前杀死被标记的怪物。",
	"Psychopomps are guardians and shepherds of the dead, and work to guide and protect the souls of all perished creatures on their journey through the afterlife. A wide range of these supernatural creatures dwell in the outer planes, favoring neutrally aligned domains and often gathering in the realms of deities associated with the dead. The least of their kind are small and birdlike, while the most deadly appear more like dragons.

They dress in flowing spidersilk and wear masks reminiscent of webs, as they consider patient and watchful spiders to be their spiritual kin.": "Morrignas（莫林娜）特别是作为赏金猎人和调查员，他们追捕那些试图阻挡死亡或干涉灵魂自然流动的人。他们穿着流动的蜘蛛丝服装，戴着让人联想到蜘蛛网的面具，因为他们认为耐心和警惕的蜘蛛是他们的精神同类。",
	"A mu spore is a rare fungoid monstrosity of vast power and strange intellect. Few mu spores are smaller than a hundred feet from tentacle tip to tentacle tip, yet despite this bulk, they are capable of flying with an uncommon grace.

	"In its resting form, a mudwretch looks like a large puddle of thick, dark mud, heaped at the center in a slightly drier patch of loam. When a living creature approaches, though, the mudwretch lurches upward, piling its muddy flesh upon itself to form a roughly humanoid shape, often in vague mockery of the approaching creature's general form in cases where the creature is a humanoid itself. Mudwretches have a low level of intellect, and while they do not form societies or cultures of their own, they are attracted to ruins or abandoned settlements.": "在休眠状态下，一个泥怪看起来像一个大水坑，里面是厚厚的黑泥，在中心堆积着一块稍微干燥的壤土。然而，当有活物靠近时，泥怪会突然站起来，将泥泞的肉体堆叠起来，形成一个粗略的人形，通常是在模糊地模仿靠近生物的一般形态，如果这个生物本身是一个人形生物的话。泥怪的智力水平很低，虽然它们不会形成自己的社会或文化，但它们会被废墟或废弃的定居点所吸引。",
	"Crows are common in the Stolen Lands and do not normally pose a danger to explorers of these wilds.

	"Demons are cruel and chaotic fiends who form from the souls of sinful mortals who have been consigned to the nightmare realm of the chaotic evil outer planes. As fecund as they are destructive, demons remain a favorite type of minion of many a cult.

	"The alien monstrosity Niodrhast has been stranded below Candlemere for centuries, but spent much of that time in hibernation. This creature can also be used as a lurking threat in other ways.

	"Nyrissa serves as the primary villain of the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}. Using her statistics for a foe in another campaign can be tricky, particularly if some of your players have played Kingmaker before. Never underestimate the value of simply changing a foe's name to disguise the origin of its statistics!

	"Peludas are territorial, feral dragons that favor building lairs in reedy marshlands, sparsely forested bogs, and river valleys. A single peluda typically claims a stretch of waterway a few miles in length, often choosing a den somewhere near a river's source. After doing so, the peluda systematically drives off any potential rivals so that they can despoil the land as they please, leaving clawed footprints on muddy riverbanks, littering the ground with sharp scales, toppling trees, and impaling half-eaten corpses on their quills as trophies left to rot.

	"The first shoggoths were created by an alien species to serve as mindless beasts of burden. Their vast bulk, incredible strength, and amorphous nature made them useful as supernatural laborers, and their ability to spontaneously form whatever new eyes, mouths, limbs, and other organs they might need made them incredibly versatile. Eventually, the shoggoths developed enough intelligence to rebel against their masters, and now they lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless depths. Made of seething black protoplasm, a shoggoth's actual shape remains a constant chaos of awful, perplexing change.": "第一批章鱼人(`shoggoths`)是由外星物种创造的，用来作为无意识的劳动工具。它们庞大的体型、惊人的力量和无定形的特性使它们成为超自然劳动者，而它们可以自发地形成新的眼睛、嘴巴、四肢和其他器官的能力使它们非常多才多艺。最终，章鱼人们发展出足够的智慧反抗他们的主人，现在它们潜伏在无光的深处，耐心而强大。由滚烫的黑原生质构成，章鱼人的实际形态始终是一种可怕、令人困惑的混乱变化。",

For many years, she struggled with this against her desire to respect her father, and so she leaned into the martial aspect of her training.

When the plant detects the approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system, it rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, releasing a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. Many a story claims the viper vine can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.

These holes are the mouths of winding tunnels that connect to a second pair of apertures on the submerged side of the island outside, allowing the waters of the Little Sellen River to plunge down into this room, possibly damaging or knocking prone those in the square portion of the room itself (but not in the adjoining hallway) and eventually flooding the entire chamber.": "当南面的秘密门被打开或天花板上的任何活板门被强行打开时，这个陷阱就会被触发。一旦发生这种情况，北边和南边的升降栅栏就会猛然落下，每个都由形成密封的坚固铁板组成。与此同时，天花板上的十二个5英尺宽的活板门打开。这些洞口是通往与岛屿外部水下连接的蜿蜒隧道的入口，允许小塞伦河的水流冲入这个房间，可能会损坏或使站在房间正方形部分内（但不在相邻走廊内）的人摔倒，并最终淹没整个房间。",
	"A successful {@dc 16} Dexterity ({@item thieves' tools|PHB}) check is required to disable one of the 12 trapdoors and seal it shut; disabling all 12 doors completely deactivates the trap.

Spells such as {@spell stone shape} or {@spell wall of stone} can also be used to disable parts of the trap at the GM's discretion. Each portcullis has AC 16 and 70 hit points.": "需要成功的{@dc 16} 敏捷 ({@item thieves' tools|PHB}) 检定来禁用其中一个12个活板门并将其封闭; 禁用所有12个门会完全停用陷阱。需要一个{@dc 14} 敏捷 ({@item thieves' tools|PHB}) 检定来禁用其中一个防水升降栅门。在GM的判断下，像{@spell stone shape} 或 {@spell wall of stone} 这样的法术也可以用来禁用陷阱的部分。每个升降栅门的护甲等级为16，生命值为70点。",

The flooding ends and the trap deactivates once the area is filled to the ceiling—at this point, the floodwaters equalize with the external environment and do not continue to flood the rest of the dungeon, but creatures still trapped in the room begin drowning. A Medium or smaller creature can try to swim to freedom through one of the 5-foot-wide tunnels leading to the river but doing so requires navigating 200 feet of flooded tunnels.": "如果所有12个活板门都打开，房间的水位每轮上升1英尺。如果其中一个升降门被打开，或者一半的活板门被关闭，陷阱的水位上升速度减半；如果两者同时发生，水位上升速度减至四分之一。当区域被填满至天花板时，洪水停止并陷阱停止作用——此时，洪水与外部环境达到平衡，不会继续淹没地牢的其他部分，但仍被困在房间里的生物会开始溺水。中型或更小的生物可以尝试通过通往河流的5英尺宽隧道之一游向自由，但这样做需要穿越200英尺的被淹没隧道。",

Most significantly, we've redesigned the adventure to offer more than enough sandbox play for the PCs to be able to advance all the way to 20th level by the campaign's end—indeed, some parties who focus on completing every possible encounter might find themselves hitting 20th level well before the campaign reaches its final chapter!": "在更新{@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}的过程中，与十年前的原版六卷相比，我们所做的远不止是简单地翻译规则和重建属性块。我们汲取了{@i Pathfinder: Kingmaker}由Owlcat Games创作的视频游戏的灵感，吸收了超过10年反馈意见的建议和观察，以及我们自己对第一次呈现的框架进行扩展的愿望，我们已经大幅扩展了{@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}的范围。最重要的是，我们重新设计了冒险，为玩家角色提供了足够的沙盒游戏空间，使他们能够在整个战役结束时达到20级—事实上，一些专注于完成每一个可能遭遇的队伍可能会在战役达到最终章之前就达到20级！",
	"This book does not present a full conversion of the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} from Pathfinder Second Edition to 5E, but presents you with as many stat blocks for monsters, NPCs, hazards, and companions as possible instead to make running the game for your group much easier.

	"Some elements of the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} might be unfamiliar to those who haven't played Pathfinder before. It's best if you have at least a passing familiarity with the mechanics of Pathfinder Second Edition and the Lost Omens Campaign Setting if you intend on running this campaign using 5E rules, so that as you read through the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} you'll understand the encounters better and be more able to resolve challenges the PCs face using the rules and mechanics of 5E.": "对于那些之前没有玩过寻径者（Pathfinder）的人来说，{@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} 的一些元素可能会感到陌生。如果您打算使用5E规则来进行这个冒险，最好您至少对寻径者第二版（Pathfinder Second Edition）的机制和失落兆迹（Lost Omens）战役设定有一定了解，这样当您阅读{@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}时，您将更好地理解遇到的挑战，并能够更好地使用5E的规则和机制来解决PCs所面临的问题。",

	"Now and then, you'll see rules presented for special actions and activities, such as Fight Fires or Dig Up the Trapdoor. Often, these challenges are resolved when a PC makes an ability check. In most cases, these actions are things that a PC can attempt to do during their turn—whether or not the action can be taken as a move should be something you decide based on the context of the encounter. Activities are multi-turn pursuits that can take several minutes, hours, days, or longer to perform—the exact time required for an activity is always indicated in the text.": "偶尔，您会看到有关特殊动作和活动的规则，比如（战斗火灾）或（挖开活板门）。通常，这些挑战会在玩家角色进行能力检定时解决。在大多数情况下，这些动作是玩家角色可以在他们的回合内尝试做的事情——无论这个动作是否可以作为移动动作进行，都应该根据遭遇的情境来决定。活动是跨越多个回合的追求，可能需要几分钟、几小时、几天甚至更长时间来完成——活动所需的确切时间总是在文本中指明的。",

	"A significant aspect of the Kingmaker experience revolves around the creation of an entire kingdom and clashes with enemy armies. Though the rules for building kingdoms and running warfare encounters presented in the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} use Pathfinder Second Edition as their foundation, every effort has been made to make those rules as self-contained as possible. Since playing out Kingdom turns and warfare encounters occurs largely outside the scope of the adventure's primary plot, you can use these self-contained rules as add-ons to any 5E game—or any game that uses another rules system. Of course, as mentioned above, developing familiarity with Pathfinder Second Edition rules and mechanics can help you to run kingdom-building content and warfare encounters. If you prefer to avoid that, keep in mind that the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} still works if the kingdom develops in the background through narrative play. See the various chapters in the Adventure Path for advice on how to run kingdom development in this manner.": "《{@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}》中一个重要的方面是围绕着创建整个王国和与敌军的冲突展开的经历。尽管建立王国和进行战争遭遇的规则以《Pathfinder第二版》作为基础，但已经尽一切努力使这些规则尽可能自成体系。由于王国回合和战争遭遇的进行大部分发生在冒险主要情节之外，你可以将这些自成体系的规则作为任何5E游戏的附加内容，或者任何使用其他规则系统的游戏。当然，如上所述，熟悉《Pathfinder第二版》的规则和机制可以帮助你运行建立王国内容和战争遭遇。如果你更喜欢避开这一点，请记住，如果王国通过叙事游戏在背景中发展，那么《{@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}》仍然适用。请参阅冒险路径中的各章节，了解如何以这种方式运行王国发展。",
	"The world of Golarion is the focus of Pathfinder's Lost Omens Campaign Setting and the primary setting of the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}. If you're not familiar with Golarion's lore, some elements of the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} might confuse you. We've tried to keep the stat blocks presented in this book relatively free of too much world lore, but in some cases—particularly when it comes to mentioning locations, deities, languages, or other planes, we've kept the lore in place. For languages in particular this might be confusing, as there are many tongues unique to Golarion that don't exist in other settings. Fortunately, you can switch out a creature's languages as works best in your game without particularly impacting their statistics.": "Golarion的世界是Pathfinder的失落兆迹战役设定的焦点，也是{@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}的主要背景。如果你不熟悉Golarion的传说，可能会对{@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}的一些元素感到困惑。我们尽量让本书中呈现的属性块相对不受太多世界传说的影响，但在某些情况下——特别是涉及到地点、神祇、语言或其他位面时，我们保留了传说。对于语言而言，这可能会令人困惑，因为Golarion有许多其他设定中不存在的独特语言。幸运的是，在你的游戏中，你可以根据需要更改生物的语言，而不会特别影响它们的统计数据。",
	"Gameplay is split into three modes. Encounter mode consists of the round-by-round play of combat. Exploration mode covers overland travel and events that can take several hours in-game to resolve but can generally be played out at the table in a matter of minutes. Downtime mode encompasses situations when days or even weeks pass at a time in-game during the course of several minutes of play at the table.": "游戏分为三种模式。遭遇模式包括战斗的逐轮进行。探索模式涵盖了陆地旅行和事件，可能需要几个小时的游戏时间来解决，但通常可以在桌上用几分钟的时间来进行。闲暇模式涵盖了游戏中经过数天甚至数周的情况，在桌上进行几分钟的游戏时间。",
	"The assumption in Pathfinder Second Edition is that variance in level between characters is rare, and that in most cases, every PC in a party is of the same level. \"Party level\" in this case can be interpreted as being the same as the party's average level.": "在《Pathfinder 第二版》中的假设是，角色之间的等级差异很少见，大多数情况下，一个队伍中的每个PC都是相同等级的。在这种情况下，“队伍等级”可以解释为与队伍的平均等级相同。",
	"When converting monsters from the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} for this book, we generally used challenge ratings that are equal to the levels expressed in their Second Edition stat blocks. In some cases, challenge ratings might be slightly lower or higher than the creatures' corresponding levels in the adventure. As you run your game, you may find that these challenge ratings might feel too high or too low, and you should examine each encounter with an eye toward how it might play for your specific group before introducing it. You can adjust a creature's challenge rating manually if you wish, but often it'll be easier to reduce the total number of creatures in order to provide a more appropriate encounter for your group.": "在为本书转换怪物时，我们通常使用的挑战等级与它们第二版状态块中表达的等级相等。在某些情况下，挑战等级可能会略低或略高于冒险中对应的等级。在进行游戏时，您可能会发现这些挑战等级可能感觉过高或过低，您应该在引入之前审查每个遭遇，以便了解它在您特定团队中的运行方式。如果您希望，您可以手动调整怪物的挑战等级，但通常减少怪物的总数会更容易为您的团队提供更合适的遭遇。",
	"Additionally, the types of treasure recovered from encounters in Pathfinder Second Edition can be quite different than in 5E games. As your players defeat foes and search for loot, don't hesitate to adjust the amount or type of treasure handed out in encounters to help keep your PCs appropriately geared-up for the fights to come. It's a good idea to generate replacement treasures ahead of time so that when your players defeat the monsters, they won't have to wait for you to pick and choose their prizes!": "此外，在《Pathfinder 第二版》中，从遭遇中获得的宝藏类型可能会与 5E 游戏中的截然不同。当你的玩家打败敌人并搜寻战利品时，不要犹豫调整在遭遇中分发的宝藏数量或类型，以帮助确保你的角色们在即将到来的战斗中装备得当。提前生成替代宝藏是个好主意，这样当你的玩家打败怪物时，他们就不必等待你挑选奖品了！",
	"The creatures presented in this chapter include well-known monsters of the high-fantasy genre as well as dangerous variants of those creatures. Some of these creatures might be familiar, as they have been inspired and converted from previous incarnations across numerous editions of the game. Others are entirely new adversaries that appear for the first time in print in the various books related to this adventure. In many cases, the creatures that appear on the following pages fall somewhere in between the old and new—those that have been revised and recast as more challenging foes to better fit their roles within the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}. To conserve space, flavor text for these monsters has been kept to a minimum, but efforts have been made to include at least a physical description for each. For many of these creatures, additional lore can be found in the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} or one of the Pathfinder Bestiaries (First or Second Edition).": "本章介绍的生物包括高奇幻类型中众所周知的怪物，以及这些生物的危险变种。其中一些生物可能很熟悉，因为它们受到了游戏多个版本中以前版本的启发和转化。其他一些是全新的对手，首次出现在与这次冒险相关的各种书籍中。在许多情况下，出现在接下来的页面上的生物介于新旧之间——它们已经被修改和重塑为更具挑战性的敌人，以更好地适应它们在{@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}中的角色。为了节省空间，这些怪物的风格文本被保持在最低限度，但已经努力包含至少一个物理描述。对于许多这些生物，可以在{@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}或《Pathfinder怪物手册》（第一版或第二版）中找到更多传说。",

	"This chapter presents all of the significant, unique NPCs from the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}, be they minor allies, primary villains, unique monsters, or anyone in between. Each of these NPCs is presented with a condensed version of their role in the larger campaign, focusing primarily on their rules. For the full details of their impact in the campaign you'll need to consult the adventures themselves.": "本章介绍了{@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}中所有重要的、独特的NPC，无论是次要盟友、主要反派、独特怪物还是其他人。每个NPC都附有其在整个战役中角色的简化版本，主要侧重于他们的规则。要了解他们在战役中的影响的全部细节，您需要查阅相关冒险内容。",
	"Of course, using these statistics for encounters in a Kingmaker campaign is not the only way an enterprising GM can utilize these NPCs. Any of the characters detailed in this chapter can be dropped into ongoing campaigns, either as is or after changing some of their flavor or appearance. The statistics for the legendary lake monster {@creature Hooktongue|PKB}, for example, can become a species of deadly oceanic predator that dwells in a dangerous stretch of sea. The cult leader {@creature Malgorzata Niska|PKB} can be used simply as the rank-and-file priestess for a much larger group of Gyronna-worshipping criminals. Each of these NPCs features suggestions for how they can be used beyond a Kingmaker campaign; feel free to adhere to these recommendations exactly or use them as inspiration for other roles. Even when used against a party who has played through Kingmaker before, simply changing an NPC's name and description can save time when preparing for a game where it's likely that the players will never discover where the idea for the foe came from.": "当然，利用这些统计数据来设计《王国创世者 (Kingmaker)》战役中的遭遇并不是有远见的GM可以利用这些NPC的唯一方式。本章中详细介绍的任何角色都可以被放入正在进行的战役中，可以原样使用，也可以在改变一些风味或外表后使用。例如，传说中的湖怪{@creature Hooktongue|PKB}的统计数据可以变成一种生活在危险海域的致命海洋掠食者。邪教领袖{@creature Malgorzata Niska|PKB}可以简单地用作更大一群Gyronna崇拜的罪犯中的一名普通祭司。这些NPC中的每一个都提供了如何在《王国创世者》战役之外使用它们的建议；可以完全遵循这些建议，也可以将其用作其他角色的灵感。即使用于对抗之前已经玩过《王国创世者》的一组玩家，只需改变NPC的名字和描述，就可以节省准备游戏的时间，而玩家们可能永远不会发现这个敌人的创意来源。",
	"Armag is one of the primary villains encountered during Kingmaker, but his villainy is in large part the result of influence from the deadly weapon he wields, {@item Ovinrbaane, Enemy of All Enemies|PKB|Ovinrbaane}. During your campaign, you can maintain this relationship between Armag and his sword, or you can replace {@item Ovinrbaane, Enemy of All Enemies|PKB|Ovinrbaane} and simply use Armag as a leader of ferocious warriors. Likewise, you can establish {@item Ovinrbaane, Enemy of All Enemies|PKB|Ovinrbaane} as the goal of a quest; perhaps the PCs race against a rival adventuring group to recover the dangerous sword from a crypt in order to prevent it from giving rise to a new warlord.": "阿玛格(Armag)是《(*Kingmaker*)称王者》中遭遇的主要反派之一，但他的恶行在很大程度上是由他所持有的致命武器{@item Ovinrbaane, Enemy of All Enemies|PKB|Ovinrbaane}的影响所致。在你的游戏中，你可以保持阿玛格与他的剑之间的这种关系，或者你可以替换{@item Ovinrbaane, Enemy of All Enemies|PKB|Ovinrbaane}，只将阿玛格作为凶猛战士的领袖。同样，你可以将{@item Ovinrbaane, Enemy of All Enemies|PKB|Ovinrbaane}确立为一个任务的目标；也许玩家角色们要在竞争对手的冒险团队之前赶在一个地下墓穴中找回这把危险的剑，以防止它助长新的军阀的崛起。",

	"These two mitflits are more accomplished than most of their kind, although their choice to focus their efforts on a marble launcher might not be the most efficient use of their training. You can use these statistics for any mitflit gremlin that's managed the luck and skill to live long enough to hone their combat prowess—whether or not you let them keep their marble launcher. Of course, switching the type of damage the marble launcher deals when it hits a target also lets you change the launcher into a glass slinger (slashing damage), a coal flinger (fire damage), or a poison toad-launcher (poison damage).": "这两只米特弗利特比大多数同类更有造诣，尽管他们选择将精力集中在弹珠发射器上可能不是他们训练的最有效利用方式。您可以使用这些统计数据来描述任何米特弗利特小鬼，只要它们有足够的运气和技巧活到足够长的时间来磨练他们的战斗能力——无论您是否让它们保留他们的弹珠发射器。当然，改变弹珠发射器击中目标时造成的伤害类型也可以让您将发射器改变成玻璃投石器（斩击伤害）、煤炭投掷器（火焰伤害）或毒蟾蜍发射器（毒素伤害）。",
	"Virthad is a particularly mean-spirited doppelganger. As a cleric of Lamashtu, their ability to change shape affords them a layer of subtlety that many villains lack. Though Virthad might adopt any guise—such as the goblin priest reflected in their stat block—who they impersonate in your game is defined by your imagination. Their skill at {@skill deception}, however, should help them pose as a member of any faith common to the region in which they reside.": "维尔萨德(Virthad)是一个特别心机的变形怪。作为拉玛舒(Lamashtu)的神职人员，他们变形的能力使他们比许多恶棍更具微妙性。尽管维尔萨德可能采取任何伪装——比如他们的属性块中反映的哥布林祭司——在你的游戏中，他们冒充谁取决于你的想象力。然而，他们在{@skill deception}方面的技能应该帮助他们假扮成所居住地区普遍信仰的任何教派的成员。",
	"Volodmyra is a mid-ranking member of the Black Tears, and the commander of the attack force sent to invade {@creature Jamandi Aldori|PKB|Jamandi Aldori's} manor at the start of the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}.

	"Vordakai is one of the primary villains of the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path}: a cyclops lich whose power has atrophied to a shadow of his former glory. As with {@creature Nyrissa|PKB}, he's such a memorable foe that transplanting him into other games runs the risk of breaking verisimilitude for any players who have previously played Kingmaker.

Of course, if one of these companions joins your players' group and spends time adventuring with them, you should feel free to level them up as you see fit.": "{@i Kingmaker Companion Guide}为七名旅行同伴的完整统计数据，这些同伴可能在整个冒险过程中与玩家角色相遇。每个同伴NPC都被设计成玩家角色的样子，并分别以两个不同的属性块呈现——一个是它们在1级时的样子，也就是它们可能首次被遇到时的样子；另一个是在与它们相关联的{@i Kingmaker Companion Guide}冒险等级相等的更高级别时的样子。当然，如果其中一名同伴加入了你的玩家团队并与他们一起冒险一段时间，你可以随意根据需要提升他们的等级。",
	"You can also use these companions as replacement characters in the case of an unexpected PC death, or as NPCs with entirely different stories to tell in campaigns of your own devising.": "您也可以将这些同伴作为替代角色，以应对意外的玩家角色死亡，或者作为完全不同故事的NPC，在您自己设计的战役中讲述。",
