Gurravenes are fascinated by mechanical devices, particularly traps, and tend to place them throughout their lairs, more to examine the suffering they cause firsthand rather than to keep their demesnes safe.": "与它们所代表的食尸鬼一样，格拉文温斯(gurravenes)永无止境地渴望。它们栖息的地方，无论是在永恒之喉(Evermaw)还是其他存在的位面，都是充满腐烂肉体和腐肉生物的恶臭尸坑，供它们觅食。尽管不需要食物来维持生存，格拉文温斯会吞食它们杀死的生物的每一丝肉，同时努力保持它们的食品储备充足。格拉文温斯对机械装置特别着迷，尤其是陷阱，并倾向于在它们的巢穴中布置这些陷阱，更多是为了亲自体验它们造成的痛苦，而不是为了保护它们的领地安全。",
	"Each gurravene styles itself the master of its domain and grooms {@creature ghoul|MM} and {@creature ghast|MM} servitors to see to its desires. When they use their ability to take on a humanoid aspect, they gravitate to poor areas with large settlements where they feel a few missing people won't be noticed. Gurravenes find darakhul too strong-willed and difficult to keep control of. Alliances between the two types of creatures are almost always short-lived and often end with the gurravene attempting to destroy its darakhul ally.": "每个古拉文(Gurravene)都认为自己是领地的主宰，并培养{@creature ghoul|MM}和{@creature ghast|MM}仆从来满足自己的欲望。当它们利用能力呈现人形时，它们会倾向于贫困地区，那里有大量居民，他们觉得几个失踪的人不会引起注意。古拉文发现达拉库尔(Darakhul)太过意志坚定，难以控制。这两种生物之间的联盟几乎总是短暂的，通常以古拉文试图摧毁其达拉库尔盟友而告终。",
	"Reciraloths are yugoloth shock troops, eternal soldiers in a never-ending struggle to control the suffering.": "Reciraloths是尤戈洛斯冲击部队，永恒的士兵，在永无止境的控制痛苦的斗争中。",
	"Reciraloths display no outwardly visible eyes, showing only an eerie glow below their fleshed-over sockets when in darkness, but they see as well as any other creature. In fact, their strange ocular organs allow them a preternatural sense, regardless of visibility conditions.": "瑞西拉洛斯(Reciraloths)没有明显的外部眼睛，在黑暗中只显示在肉眼覆盖的眼眶下的一种怪异的发光，但它们的视力和其他生物一样。事实上，它们奇特的眼器官让它们拥有一种超自然的感知能力，无论可见条件如何。",
	"Among the lowest ranking yugoloths, reciraloths are considered a disposable, renewable resource by their masters—and with good reason. Each reciraloth that dies finds their essence funneled back to the Void, where their soulstuff is pooled, and they are crafted anew. This resurrected fiend is not precisely the same, but every reciraloth has faint memories of every untold time they have died. With no true death, they have no fear in battle.": "在最低级别的尤戈洛斯中，(reciraloths) 被认为是他们主人可以随意使用、可再生的资源，这是有充分理由的。每个死去的(reciraloth) 的本质都会被重新汇入虚空，他们的灵魂物质会被汇集，然后重新塑造。这个被复活的恶魔并非完全相同，但每个(reciraloth) 都有关于他们每次死亡的微弱记忆。由于没有真正的死亡，他们在战斗中毫无恐惧。",
	"Reciraloths display slavish obedience to higher-caste yugoloths and a pack-like devotion to others of their kind in battle. Yet outside of combat, they can and will betray one another for personal gain as the base essence of yugoloth-kind shows through, and this betrayal is the first step toward their transfiguration to a higher caste.": "瑞西拉洛斯（Reciraloths）对上位种姓的尤戈洛斯（higher-caste yugoloths）表现出奴性的服从，对自己种族的其他成员在战斗中表现出类似狼群的忠诚。然而，在战斗之外，由于尤戈洛斯种族的基本本质显现，他们可以并且会为了个人利益背叛彼此，这种背叛是他们向更高种姓转变的第一步。",
	"Sharavenes feel more of an animosity toward {@creature ghost|MM|ghosts} and other insubstantial undead than an affinity for them. The mere presence of a sharavene causes incorporeal undead to attack any living creature near them in a near-mindless frenzy.

	"Despite their disdain for {@creature ghost|MM|ghosts} and their ilk, sharavenes enjoy using their ability to take on a ghostly aspect to manipulate mortals. A favorite tactic of theirs is to take up residence in the home of a mortal and convince them they are a deceased relative or former resident. They then ask their roommate to undertake a series of tasks, often of bizarre or unsettling nature, in order to put their spirit to rest. When the unfortunate victim of their prank realizes they are being toyed with, the sharavene kills them and raises them as a {@creature ghost|MM} that they quickly abandon.": "尽管夏拉文人对{@creature ghost|MM|ghosts}及其同类不屑一顾，他们喜欢利用自己的能力呈现幽灵般的形态来操纵凡人。他们最喜欢的策略之一是搬进凡人的家中，说服他们自己是已故亲戚或前居民。然后，他们会要求室友完成一系列任务，通常是怪异或令人不安的性质，以便让他们的灵魂得到安息。当被愚弄的不幸受害者意识到自己被戏弄时，夏拉文人会杀死他们，并将他们变成{@creature ghost|MM}，然后迅速抛弃。",

Occasionally they grow tired of the more subtle schemes and simply kill outright, blaming others for their brutal slayings.": "Viridriloths（维瑞德里斯）喜欢隐藏在黑暗中或在手下的阴影掩护下。作为极具狡诈的存在，它们利用自身的天赋能力充当间谍、破坏者和操纵者。偶尔它们会厌倦更为微妙的阴谋，直接展开杀戮，将残忍的谋杀行为归咎于他人。",
	"Viridriloths envy their corporeal brethren and as such are prone to be brutal taskmasters of lesser yugoloths. That envy is multiplied tenfold toward non-yugoloths—and particularly mortals. Viridriloths delight in possessing mortals and indulging their cruelty while masked in mortal flesh.": "绿龙魔（Viridriloths）嫉妒他们有实体的同类，因此往往成为对较低级的犹格罗魔（yugoloths）残酷的苛刻监工。这种嫉妒对非犹格罗魔——尤其是凡人——更是加倍。绿龙魔喜欢占据凡人的身体，隐藏在凡人的肉体中纵情施虐。",

It is a primordial name, given to these same aberrations by the dragons who coined it from a repeated syllabic phrase pulled from their incessant maddening chatter.": "在米德加德之前的时代，只有虚空存在——在那黎明之中栖息着阿胡尼克斯塔。虽然凡人用这个名字来定义一群古老的畸变异类，虚空产生的暴君，但它同样可以代表一种理念或者阿胡尼克斯塔存在的源泉。这是一个原始的名字，由龙类赋予这些畸变者，龙类从它们不断疯狂的喋喋不休中提取出来的重复音节短语。",
	"At one time, the ahu-nixta held dominion over many races. Cruel masters, they fed upon the younger entities and stole from them those elements they needed to transcend the Void. They broke the creatures they enslaved—salvaging flesh and bone, dominating thoughts, harvesting fears—and they warped them into vessels for their own designs. But just like those creatures, the encasements built from them proved weak and inefficient, prone to physical aging and damage. No matter how the ahu-nixta manipulated the raw materials, the result was always insufficient. To overcome these flaws, they sought out other raw materials, metals and crystals and other elements, the same the mortal races forged into tools and machinery. Using these new resources, they copied and cobbled, implanted and spliced, creating new forms, each stronger and more lasting.": "曾经，阿胡尼克斯塔(Ahu-Nixta)统治着许多种族。作为残酷的主宰，他们以年轻实体为食，并从他们那里窃取需要超越虚空的元素。他们摧毁所奴役的生物——拆解肉体和骨骼，控制思想，收割恐惧——并将它们扭曲成为符合自己设计的容器。然而，就像那些生物一样，由它们构建的外壳证明是脆弱且低效的，容易受到物理老化和损坏的影响。无论阿胡尼克斯塔如何操纵原材料，结果总是不尽人意。为了克服这些缺陷，他们寻找其他原材料，金属、晶体和其他元素，与凡人种族锻造成工具和机械的相同元素。利用这些新资源，他们复制、拼凑、植入和剪接，创造出新形态，每一种都更强大、更持久。",

(The text is unclear whether the ahu-nixta are multiple entities or but a single entity spread through multiple forms.) The hive mind then warps the pieces, devouring the realm from the inside out. The theory also attempts to define the Concordant Chronosphere, the prime hive mind intelligence of the ahu-nixta.": "在传说中的{@i Codex of the Endless Void}中，一位作者推测阿胡尼克斯塔既属于虚空，又是虚空本身的物理体现。她进一步声称，阿胡尼克斯塔存在的目的是通过将自己——或者说，{@i itself}——建造成领域的一部分来将虚空扩展到其他领域。（文本不清楚阿胡尼克斯塔是多个实体还是一个单一实体分布在多个形式中。）然后，蜂群意识扭曲这些碎片，从内部吞噬领域。该理论还试图定义协调时间球，阿胡尼克斯塔的主要蜂群意识。",

	"With every mortal life an izravene takes, it absorbs a portion of the mortal's soul. The consumed soulstuff compounds until the izravene undergoes metamorphosis into a more advanced form. The method of their evolution spurs izravenes to kill as many mortals as they can in the most efficient manner possible. The fiends are drawn to places where the dying can be dispatched with little effort, such as battlefields, plague villages, and surgeries. Izravenes are also apt to prey upon other izravenes of their type as the killer will gain the soulstuff their victim has already consumed. Due to their backstabbing natures, izravenes rarely work together, doing so only when threatened and berated by a much more powerful izravene.": "每当伊兹拉文(izravene)夺取一个凡人生命，它就会吸收一部分凡人的灵魂。被吞噬的灵魂物质会不断积累，直到伊兹拉文经历变态，进化为更高级的形态。它们的进化方式促使伊兹拉文以尽可能高效的方式杀死尽可能多的凡人。这些恶魔会被吸引到那些凡人死亡可以轻松完成的地方，比如战场、瘟疫村庄和手术室。伊兹拉文也倾向于捕食同类伊兹拉文，因为杀手会获得受害者已经消耗的灵魂物质。由于它们背叛的本性，伊兹拉文很少合作，只有在受到更强大的伊兹拉文的威胁和斥责时才会这样做。",
	"Izravenes are rapacious, but they do not act hastily or carelessly. Even the least of them knows that a sword wielded by a single valorous fool can spell the end of their ambitions. Though they find it frustrating, they carefully plot out their activities. They spend time investigating the areas they would like to hunt and make sure they won't have to contend with an overabundance of heroic mortals. After each kill, they cautiously gauge any response before striking out again.": "伊兹拉文人(Izravenes)贪婪，但他们并不轻率或粗心。即使是他们中最不起眼的人也知道，一把由一个勇敢的傻瓜挥舞的剑可能会宣告他们野心的终结。尽管他们觉得这很令人沮丧，他们仔细地策划他们的活动。他们花时间调查他们想要猎杀的地区，并确保他们不必与过多的英勇凡人相抗衡。在每次杀戮之后，他们会谨慎地评估任何反应，然后再次出击。",
	"An izravene may accept a position as the lesser partner to another more powerful creature, but it will immediately start plotting to take control of the venture. Devils in particular sometimes see the value in conspiring in a limited fashion with an izravene.": "一只伊兹拉文（izravene）可能会接受作为另一个更强大生物的次要伙伴，但它会立即开始策划控制这个合作。恶魔特别是有时会看到与伊兹拉文有限度地密谋的价值。",
	"The older an izravene and the more it has metamorphosed, the more likely it is to act with caution and patience. More highly evolved izravenes spend centuries spying upon humanoid communities in order to perfect their ability to hide among them. Sometimes they take on a persona and simply live a seemingly normal life for as many years as they can without drawing undue suspicion from their neighbors. In this manner, some settlements have harbored a greedy fiend for decades, none the wiser for its presence. The patience of older izravenes is matched only by their cowardice. The more they have experienced, the more greedily they hold onto their immortality. Truly ancient and powerful izravenes, such as masavenes and azraevenes are rarely seen or discovered, hidden as they are behind armies of guardians, servitors, and possibly other izravenes.": "随着伊兹拉文（Izravene）变老和变异的次数增多，它们越有可能谨慎和耐心地行事。更高级的伊兹拉文花费数个世纪来监视人类社区，以完善他们在其中隐藏的能力。有时候，它们会扮演一个角色，简单地过着看似正常的生活，尽可能多地度过多年，而不引起邻居们不必要的怀疑。通过这种方式，一些定居点数十年来一直容纳着一个贪婪的恶魔，而没有人察觉到它的存在。年长的伊兹拉文的耐心只有它们的懦弱能与之匹敌。它们经历得越多，就越贪婪地抓住自己的不朽。像马萨文（Masavenes）和阿兹拉文（Azraevenes）这样真正古老而强大的伊兹拉文很少被看到或发现，因为它们隐藏在一支支守护者、仆人和可能其他伊兹拉文的背后。",
	"Three of the most commonly encountered types of izravenes are detailed below.": "以下是三种最常见的遭遇到的伊兹拉文斯（izravenes）类型。",
	"Some few izravenes have existed long enough and consumed such unimaginable amounts of mortal soulstuff that they have undergone apotheosis into an izravene arbiter. Arbiters are the ancient and cunning master schemers who rule over all lesser izravenes, though their independent-minded subjects dispute that the arbiters exert any true control over them. There are currently three izravene arbiters active on Evermaw, though there have been as many as five in millennia past.": "一些少数伊扎瑞文（Izravene）存在已久，并吞噬了难以想象的大量凡间灵魂物质，使它们升华为伊扎瑞文仲裁者（Izravene Arbiter）。仲裁者是古老而狡猾的主谋者，统治着所有较低级的伊扎瑞文，尽管它们那些独立思想的部下们争辩说，仲裁者并没有真正控制他们。目前在埃沃玛（Evermaw）上有三位伊扎瑞文仲裁者活跃，尽管在过去的千年里曾经有多达五位。",
	"Izravenes do not become arbiters by being careless or by making ostentatious displays of power. They calculate each maneuver, only taking action once the benefits are guaranteed and any foreseeable consequences are mitigated to the extent possible. Each plan an arbiter makes includes several different routes to achieve success as well as several exit points should the scheme turn sour.": "伊兹拉文斯（Izravenes）不会因为粗心大意或炫耀权力而成为仲裁者。他们会仔细计算每一步行动，只有在利益得到保证且可以尽可能减轻可预见的后果时才采取行动。每个仲裁者制定的计划都包括几种不同的成功途径，以及几个应对计划失败的撤退点。",
	"Arbiters insulate themselves against their enemies in a number of ways. Each of them adopts several false personas, using them to draw out and snuff opposition before they become aware of the truth. They also groom minions whose job is to act as the arbiter in public and social situations. Almost every encounter with an izravene arbiter is actually with an underling posing as its master.": "仲裁者们通过多种方式与敌人保持距离。每个仲裁者都采用了几个虚假身份，利用它们来引诱和扼杀敌对势力，使其在意识到真相之前就被消灭。他们还培养手下，让他们在公共和社交场合充当仲裁者的角色。几乎每次与伊扎瓦尼（Izravene）仲裁者的交锋实际上都是与伪装成主人的手下进行的。",
	"Arbiters place spies with every potential threat or rival they can gain access to as well as placing loyal agents within their own organizations in order to root out traitors and betrayers.": "仲裁者在与潜在威胁或对手有关的每个地方安插间谍，同时也在自己的组织中安插忠诚的特工，以便揪出叛徒和背叛者。",
	"Like every other izravene, arbiters crave power and dominance over their kind and their rivals. Despite the precautions they take against betrayal, the reaches of Evermaw are dotted with the husks of fallen izravene arbiters. While some of the dead are the victims of celestial crusades, demonic incursions, or elemental stampedes, most destroyed izravene arbiters fell to the machinations of another arbiter. As lesser izravenes prey upon each other for soulstuff, so too do the apex izravenes. The difference between the two is simply in scale as an arbiter has no qualms about devastating a continent or an entire world in its quest for absolute power.": "与其他伊扎瑞文一样，仲裁者渴望权力和对他们的同类和对手的统治。尽管他们采取了防范背叛的措施，但埃弗莫的边境遍布着倒下的伊扎瑞文仲裁者的残骸。虽然一些死者是天堂十字军、恶魔入侵或元素踏足的受害者，但大多数被摧毁的伊扎瑞文仲裁者都是另一位仲裁者的阴谋所致。正如较弱的伊扎瑞文相互捕食灵魂物质一样，顶级伊扎瑞文也是如此。两者之间的区别仅仅在于规模，因为仲裁者在追求绝对权力的过程中毫不犹豫地摧毁一个大陆或整个世界。",
	"In their true form, Marizzet appears to be a beautiful, androgynous celestial with alabaster skin and gray-feathered wings dotted with hundreds of blinking yellow eyes. This form is rarely seen however as the fiend most often appears to be an immense, decrepit-looking owl whose face is a decaying, maggot-filled hollow. The form has sickly yellow and red scales that create eye-like patterns across their torso and wings.": "在其真实形态中，(Marizzet)看起来是一个美丽的、雌雄同体的天界生物，拥有雪白的皮肤和灰色羽翼，上面点缀着数百只闪烁着黄色眼睛的羽毛。然而，这种形态很少被看到，因为这个恶魔更常出现为一个巨大、破旧的模样鸮鸟，其脸部是一个腐烂、充满蛆虫的空洞。这种形态有着病态的黄色和红色鳞片，在它们的躯干和翅膀上形成眼睛般的图案。",
	"Marizzet, the first izravene, was the first creature to erupt from the nameless titan and is among the most powerful creatures on Evermaw that have not attained true divinity. They are incalculably ancient and plot to assume control of reality by simultaneously slaying all life on the Material Plane and immediately animating it all as undead. A few millennia past, Marizzet almost achieved their goal but were derailed by the betrayal of their former stand-in, ally, and lover Lizzil. The sting of treachery burns in Marizzet's breast still, and they have made several frustrated attempts to destroy the deceiver.": "马里泽特(Marizzet)，第一位伊兹拉文(izravene)，是从无名巨人身上首次涌现的生物，是埃弗莫(Evermaw)上最强大的生物之一，尚未获得真正的神性。他们的年代无法计算，计划通过同时屠杀物质位面上的所有生命并立即将其全部复活为不死生物来控制现实。几千年前，马里泽特几乎实现了他们的目标，但被他们的前任替身、盟友和恋人莉兹尔(Lizzil)的背叛所阻止。背叛的刺痛仍在马里泽特的胸中燃烧，他们曾多次挫败地试图摧毁这个欺骗者。",
	"Ullivire usually appears in the form of a tiny, decaying winged snake whose eyes have been pecked out. In truth, their appearance is of a desiccated, eight-eyed raven from which bone dust constantly puffs. The number of wings and legs Ullivire sports ranges from two to eight.": "乌利维尔 (Ullivire) 通常以一个微小的、腐烂的、被啄出眼睛的有翅膀的蛇的形态出现。事实上，它们的外表是一个干瘪的、有八只眼睛的乌鸦，不断地从它身上喷出骨灰。乌利维尔 (Ullivire) 的翅膀和腿的数量从两到八不等。",
	"Ullivire ascended to the ranks of the arbiters merely a few millennia ago. Since their apotheosis, there have been no actual sightings of the creature as they have hidden themself as the familiar of Uch-Tal Hirbaruss, a lich of middling power and import. Under the lich's protection, Ullivire has used their so-called master's resources to build a vast information network to keep abreast of happenings on the Plane of Undeath.": "乌利维尔(Ullivire)仅仅几千年前晋升为仲裁者的行列。自他们的神格化以来，这个生物再也没有被实际发现过，因为他们隐藏在了乌克-塔尔·希巴鲁斯(Uch-Tal Hirbaruss)的身边，后者是一个实力和影响力一般的巫妖。在这位巫妖的保护下，乌利维尔利用他们所谓主人的资源建立了一个庞大的信息网络，以便及时了解亡域(Plane of Undeath)上发生的事情。",
	"Lizzil spent thousands of years as a stand-in for Marizzet, and their true form is the same as their former lover's false one, but the pattern of the scales is the reverse of Marizzet's. Lizzil never adopts a different form.": "Lizzil（(Lizzil)）在数千年间一直充当Marizzet（(Marizzet)）的替身，他们的真实形态与前恋人的虚假形态相同，但鳞片的图案与Marizzet的相反。Lizzil（(Lizzil)）从不改变形态。",
	"While alternately treated as a plaything and a servant by Marizzet, Lizzil hoarded their secrets like a miser stockpiles copper coins. Before gaining freedom from the first izravene, Lizzil disassembled key components of Marizzet's entropy engine and stole the schematics, casting them into Ginnungagap, the Yawning Void, beyond their former companion's reach. Since then, Lizzil seems to be lurking just out of Marizzet's sights, waiting for just the right moment to spring.": "在Marizzet的眼中，Lizzil时而被当作玩物，时而被当作仆人，但Lizzil像守财奴一样积攒着他们的秘密，就像宝贝铜币一样。在从第一个izravene获得自由之前，Lizzil拆卸了Marizzet熵引擎的关键部件并窃取了设计图，将它们投入了Ginnungagap，这个无底洞，超出了他们以前伙伴的触及范围。从那时起，Lizzil似乎一直潜伏在Marizzet的视线之外，等待着合适的时机出击。",
	"Vintners of Suffering. Lie Weavers. Feasters of Misery. The Unwelcome Strangers Bearing Gifts. They have many names, and answer to them all, though the name they call {@i themselves} is simple and with no translation: yugoloth.": "苦难酿酒师。谎言编织者。苦难盛宴者。携带礼物的不速之客。他们有许多名字，对这些名字都能应答，尽管他们被称为{@i themselves}，这个名字简单而无需翻译：yugoloth。",
	"And so too, they have myriad self-spread origins. That they emerged from the Void itself as concepts taken flesh is the principal story spoken by sages and by the 'loths themselves. A secondary legend though tells that they derive from a fallen celestial race who turned on the gods upon discovering some dark secret hidden from the rest of creation. Time and again, they delight in seeding the minds of mortal scribes with ever more spurious tales of their own genesis, and in this vacuum of truth, they have yet another name: the Lost.": "因此，它们也有无数自我传播的起源。传说他们是从虚空本身涌现出来的概念化身，这是智者和`loths`们自己口中讲述的主要故事。然而，还有一个次要传说称它们源自一个堕落的天界种族，当他们发现一些对其他创造物隐藏的黑暗秘密后，便背叛了众神。一次又一次，它们乐此不疲地播种在凡人文士心中更加虚假的起源传说，在这个真相的真空中，它们又有另一个名字：失落者。",
	"Unrestrained by {@i order} and devoid of its antithesis, {@i chaos}, yugoloths are beholden to naught but {@i evil} itself, pure and unsullied beings of abstract malevolence taken physical form. Yet the 'loths themselves have long been something of an enigma in so far as what their true nature, origins, and goals might be beyond the facile surface they present as self-absorbed paragons of malice.": "在不受{@i order}限制，也没有其对立物{@i chaos}的束缚下，犹格洛斯(yugoloths)只向{@i evil}本身效忠，是纯粹而未被玷污的抽象邪恶实体。然而，犹格洛斯本身长久以来一直是一个谜，关于他们真正的本质、起源和目标可能超越了他们作为自恋邪恶楷模的肤浅表象。",
	"Native to the Void but frequently found scattered about other planes—in particular the Eleven Hells—they travel far and wide, selling their services to the highest bidder. This behavior characterizes the activity of the most common and least powerful yugoloths, but their greatest desire lies in spreading an abstract form of suffering and misery in their passage. They are paid in agony just as much as any other form of currency. They prefer to act against mortals, savoring that taste as the sweetest, and in a way, they obsess over this favorite quarry. Fascinated by the mortal experience, they seem to envy mortals for reasons unexplained. And the more powerful of yugoloths seek their worship and the chance to possess and manipulate them, which ultimately leads to ruin for the mortal.": "虽然原产于虚空，但常常在其他位面散布——尤其是在十一地狱中——它们走遍天涯海角，向出价最高的人出售他们的服务。这种行为表现了最常见、最弱小的犹格洛斯的活动特征，但它们最大的欲望在于传播一种抽象形式的痛苦和苦难。它们得到的报酬既包括痛苦，也包括其他形式的货币。它们更喜欢对抗凡人，品味那种滋味如同最甜美的味道，某种程度上，它们着迷于这个最喜爱的猎物。对凡人的经历着迷，它们似乎因无法解释的原因而羡慕凡人。而更强大的犹格洛斯寻求他们的崇拜和控制他们的机会，最终导致凡人的毁灭。",
	"No singular pattern categorizes yugoloth forms, though indeed there seems a hidden rationale underlying each type. The forms of each yugoloth caste are the finished product of raw evil and spiritual suffering poured into metaphorical molds and crafted about the lost wax of half-remembered, dark reflections of those most populous species they consumed into extinction.": "尤戈洛斯形态没有单一的模式可归类，尽管每种类型似乎都有一个隐藏的基本原理。每个尤戈洛斯种姓的形态都是原始邪恶和精神痛苦的成品，倒入比喻性的模具并围绕着那些被消灭至灭绝的最普遍物种的半记忆、黑暗反射的失落蜡制成的。",
	"The dark and buried truth of it all is they're ever emigrants through the branches of the World Tree, burning out one doomed sun after another, feasting upon them and abandoning them, like maggots blooming into flies and leaving the long-putrefied remains from which they were nourished. Their highest remember this truth and others, and they seed it all selectively to those below them, for a yugoloth ascends to higher castes only by achieving some threshold of personal power and achievement—a concurrent initiatory revelation and understanding. Yugoloth society operates as a mystery cult with the higher-ranking yugoloths seeding pieces of their truth down through the ranks, pulling the puppet strings of their lessers while blind to the strings pulled by those from above.": "这一切的黑暗和隐藏的真相是，它们永远是通过世界树的枝干迁徙的移民，一个接一个地燃烧着注定的太阳，吞噬它们然后抛弃它们，就像蛆虫绽放成苍蝇并离开长腐烂的遗骸，它们得到滋养的地方。他们中的最高者记得这个真相和其他真相，然后有选择地将这一切传播给下面的人，因为尤戈洛斯只有通过达到某种个人力量和成就的门槛才能晋升到更高的种姓——一种同时进行的启蒙启示和理解。尤戈洛斯社会运作如同一个神秘的邪教，更高级别的尤戈洛斯通过种子传播他们的真相，拉动着下属的木偶线，却对来自上方拉动的线一无所知。",
	"The specific manner in which yugoloths ascend into higher forms is unknown, but some manner of ritualized suicide or equally ritualized and torturous sacrifice is presumed. As tightly guarded as their layers of initiatory knowledge are, it is likely that a given yugoloth has no idea of what awaits it when their rulers decide to promote them, right up until it occurs, and attempts by non-yugoloths to divine these secrets by magic or torture invariably lead to only resounding silence, to a refusal by the 'loth to divulge their knowledge even when faced with obliteration by the hands of those attempting to gain what is not meant for them.": "约戈洛斯（Yugoloths）晋升至更高形态的具体方式尚不为人所知，但据推测可能涉及某种仪式化的自杀或同样仪式化和折磨性的牺牲。尽管他们的入门知识层层保密，但一个约戈洛斯在其统治者决定提拔他们时很可能并不知道等待着他们的是什么，直到发生时，而非约戈洛斯试图通过魔法或酷刑揭示这些秘密的尝试总是只会导致深深的沉默，约戈洛斯拒绝在面对那些试图获取不属于他们的知识的人的毁灭时透露他们的知识。",
	"Regardless of how it occurs, form by higher form, yugoloths ascend the ranks of caste until they reach the penultimate position of Ibshalek, those unique yugoloth lords of the Void, a title which very roughly translates as \"We Who Will Feast, We Who Remember the Feast.\"": "无论是如何发生的，从更高的形式开始，犹格洛斯（Yugoloths）在种姓中逐渐上升，直到达到倒数第二的位置——伊布沙勒克（Ibshalek），那些独特的虚空之主犹格洛斯，这个头衔非常粗略地翻译为“我们将宴享者，我们将记住宴席者”。",
	"There are said to be twelve Ibshalek, though only six of their names are commonly known—the others collectively called \"The Waiting Ones,\" who may or may not actually exist. The best known of the core six, and most powerful, include {@creature Shirveka|W29PB} the Weaver of Corrosive Promises, Alogeth the Blind Oracle-Prince, Voromek the Lord of Bitter Chains, and Y'voloka the Regent of Silent Songs. The yugoloth lords command legions of their kind like a blending of secular emperors and religious prophets, organizing the sale of those forces to other planar powers and on behalf of their own mysterious goals across the planes.": "据说有十二位伊布沙莱克(Ibshalek)，尽管只有六位的名字是众所周知的——其他人被统称为“等待者”，他们可能存在，也可能不存在。核心六位中最著名、最强大的包括{@creature Shirveka|W29PB}腐蚀诺言编织者、盲目预言王子阿洛盖斯、苦链领主沃罗梅克和寂静之歌摄政者伊沃洛卡。尤戈洛斯领主们指挥着他们的同类军团，像世俗皇帝和宗教先知的融合体，组织将这些力量出售给其他位面势力，以及代表他们自己神秘的目标在各个位面上活动。",
	"Lower tiers of yugoloths whisper to themselves that the Ibshalek serve as prophets and oracles of a singular bleak divinity, a malevolent, transcendent hunger with no name and no title, so profoundly unholy as to be unknowable but to those chosen few.": "尤戈洛斯的下层层次低语着，伊布沙莱克被视为某种单一凄凉神明的先知和神谕者，这是一种邪恶、超然的饥饿，没有名字，没有头衔，如此邪恶以至于只有少数被选中的人才能了解。",
	"This however is nothing but a lie.": "然而，这只不过是一个谎言。",
	"This yugoloth god the Ibshalek serve as bleak apostles is a lie that they whisper to themselves, propagated from highest to lowest caste to unify their kind and leash their own self-serving desires to a greater power. Only the Ibshalek know this, and it is only they who have any understanding as to what actual truth underlies their own mythology, both self-created and exogenous. It is possible they have wholly forgotten their true origins, only to travel the World Tree and spread misery to sate the hollow void of meaning within themselves, abandoned by their creators. Lost in every meaning of the word.": "这位尤格洛斯（Yugoloth）之神伊布沙勒克（Ibshalek）作为荒凉使徒的说法是他们自己私下低语的谎言，由最高到最低的种姓传播，以统一他们的种族并束缚他们自私的欲望于更伟大的力量。只有伊布沙勒克知道这一点，只有他们才能理解他们自己神话中的实际真相，无论是自我创造的还是外来的。他们可能已经完全忘记了自己真正的起源，只是为了穿越世界树（World Tree）并传播痛苦，以满足内心空虚的意义，被他们的创造者抛弃。在每个意义上都迷失了。",
	"Despite the semblance of unity the Ibshalek present to others, there is perpetual rivalry and jockeying for power and influence, and a gulf of distrust hangs wide between these so-called equals. Consumed by their own lies, they doubt their knowledge, fearing that each closely held secret truth, stolen from a long-obliterated forbearer, is nothing but a lie, the same as those they whisper to their servitors.": "尽管伊布沙莱克(Ibshalek)向他人展现出团结的外表，但他们之间却存在着永无止境的竞争和争权夺利，一个深不可测的不信任鸿沟在这些所谓的平等者之间拉得很宽。他们被自己的谎言所困扰，怀疑自己的知识，害怕每一个紧密守护的秘密真相，都是从一个早已湮灭的祖先那里窃取的，只不过是谎言，与他们低声对仆从们耳语的那些谎言一样。",
	"Yugoloths have long migrated from the Void to other planes, and they found a second home in the Eleven Hells. Perhaps it's the lessened impact of the Void or the nature of the hells or something else entirely, but whatever the cause, new types of yugoloths have distinctly increased. And while the highest caste of the yugoloths of the Void traditionally culminates in the Ibshalek, recent aeons have seen the rise of at least one new caste—witnessed in Xecha Zecha Amblamar, the Lady of Pure Distillate, lord of Emwabbik Em, the Alien Hell of the Acid Abyss—that could rival the old hierarchy. Only time will tell what happens with this potential rift.": "犹格洛斯（Yugoloths）长久以来从虚空（the Void）迁徙至其他位面，并在十一地狱（the Eleven Hells）找到了第二故乡。也许是虚空的影响减弱了，或是地狱的本质，又或者是其他原因，但无论是什么原因，新类型的犹格洛斯明显增多。虽然虚空中犹格洛斯的最高种姓传统上以伊布沙莱克（Ibshalek）为终点，但最近的时代见证了至少一种新的种姓的崛起——在泽查·泽查·安布拉玛（Xecha Zecha Amblamar）身上，她是纯粹蒸馏之主，酸渊地狱（the Alien Hell of the Acid Abyss）的领主，可能与旧有的等级制度相抗衡。只有时间才能告诉我们这种潜在的分歧会发生什么。",
	"The connections between the Ibshalek of the Void and the lord of Emwabbik Em are simply not clear—even to yugoloths. To some, the Lady of Pure Distillate is nothing more than a brilliant, heretical opportunist who departed the Void and struck out without the constraints of bending a knee to others of her kind. For a paragon of self-centered malice, it would make sense. But is it true? Or is she the first hyphae rising from virgin soil, seeding a new line to drink deep and corrupt, a rot concealed beneath an earth soon to be populated with fruiting bodies. She has certainly found ample sustenance in the Alien Hell of the Acid Abyss.": "虚空中的伊布沙莱克与恩瓦比克恩之主之间的联系简直不明确——即使对于尤戈洛斯来说也是如此。对一些人来说，纯净蒸馏女士不过是一个聪明的异端分子，离开了虚空，摆脱了向同类屈膝的束缚，并开始独立行动。对于一个以自我为中心的恶意典范来说，这是有道理的。但这是真的吗？还是她是从处女土壤中冒出的第一根菌丝，播下了一条新的线路，深深吸收腐化，一种隐藏在不久后将被果实体填满的土地下的腐烂。她在酸性深渊的外星地狱中肯定找到了充足的营养。",
	"The abyssal layer also has a number of little-known connections of importance to yugoloths and others, including to the ahu-nixta, devoted servants of Xecha Zecha Amblamar. Flickering in and out of being, like dark mirages on the shimmering horizon of some alien desert, transient portals to the Void can be found, hinting at the ruler's connection to her original home. It is possible that these portals might be stabilized by the presence of yugoloths or other Void natives, allowing them easy entrance and egress from the plane. This seems likely given that yugoloths are found here more commonly than any other layer of the hells. Many of them are present on myriad contracted jobs, serving as guardians, escorts, and mercenary armies purchased on behalf of one or another fiendish power. Beyond these however, clusters of them have been observed there without any patron, far from their native plane and often far from population centers, in transit to and from unknown locations, travelers on some unknown pilgrimage. Dovetailing on this suggestion are isolated shrines to various of the Ibshalek, located in the realm's hinterlands, many of which show signs of active, recent use and even magical wards to prevent non-yugoloths from approaching.": "深渊层还有一些鲜为人知的联系对于尤谷洛斯和其他生物来说至关重要，其中包括与阿胡-尼克斯塔(Ahu-Nixta)有关，他们是赛卡·赛卡·安布拉玛(Xecha Zecha Amblamar)的忠诚仆从。就像异星沙漠闪烁的地平线上的黑暗幻影一样，虚空的瞬时传送门时隐时现，暗示着统治者与她原始家园的联系。这些传送门可能会因尤谷洛斯或其他虚空生物的存在而稳定，使它们可以轻松进入和离开这个位面。考虑到尤谷洛斯在这里比地狱的任何其他层都更常见，这种可能性似乎很大。他们中的许多人在各种承包工作中出现，充当守卫、护卫和雇佣军，代表某个邪恶势力购买。然而，除此之外，还观察到一些尤谷洛斯聚集在那里，没有任何主人，远离他们的本位位面，通常远离人口聚集地，在前往和返回未知地点的途中，是某种未知朝圣者。与此建议相呼应的是位于领域腹地的一些独立神殿，供奉着伊布沙莱克(Ibshalek)的各种神灵，其中许多显示出活跃的迹象，最近被使用，甚至设置了魔法结界，防止非尤谷洛斯靠近。",
	"As fellow residents of the Void, it would seem natural perhaps that the satarre would be convenient allies of the yugoloths, but that assumption would be far from a more nuanced truth. Despite (seemingly) hailing from the same native plane, yugoloths view the satarre as inconvenient fellow travelers at best and more often as ideological rivals whose desire for death and destruction runs counter to the yugoloth desire for suffering and to their subsequent near obsession with mortal life as the source of such. The satarre on the other hand see the yugoloths as cowards and backstabbing schemers whose actions delay their own wished-for end of existence. It is not uncommon for the two fiendish races to clash, though in the face of outside opposition, especially by celestials, the two grudgingly cooperate.": "作为虚空的居民，萨塔尔(satarre)似乎是与尤格洛斯(yugoloths)便利的盟友，但这种假设远远不及更加微妙的真相。尽管（表面上）来自同一原生位面，尤格洛斯将萨塔尔视为最多时是不便的同行者，更常见的是意识形态上的对手，因为萨塔尔对死亡和毁灭的渴望与尤格洛斯对痛苦的渴望以及对人类生命作为这种痛苦来源的近乎痴迷是相悖的。另一方面，萨塔尔将尤格洛斯视为懦夫和阴险的阴谋家，他们的行动延缓了他们自己期望的终结。这两个邪恶种族之间发生冲突并不罕见，尽管在外部反对的情况下，尤其是天界的反对下，它们不情愿地合作。",
	"Some of the more commonly encountered types of yugoloths are detailed below.": "以下是一些常见的尤戈洛斯类型的详细信息。",
	"The demiplane known as the Broken Path has long served as a manifest enigma, promising to some sages a glance inside the quasi-religious secrets of yugoloth society itself. To others however, it seems a poisoned lure to draw those very same who would seek to expose that knowledge to the light, devouring them instead, either by slaughter or by corruption. Regardless, the Broken Path promises knowledge to initiates who dedicate themselves to exploring and understanding the patterns in its bizarre, alien architecture. But while it offers rewards and power, like yugoloth promises to mortals, every step of progress toward gnosis that they make drags them deeper into its grasp and unknowingly binds them to it, more and more deeply until they are physically unable to leave without succumbing, one way or another.": "被称为破碎之径的半位面长期以来一直是一个显而易见的谜团，对一些贤者来说，它承诺着一瞥魔兽社会准宗教秘密的机会。然而，对其他人来说，它似乎是一个有毒的诱饵，吸引那些试图揭露这些知识的人，将他们吞噬，无论是通过屠杀还是腐化。无论如何，破碎之径向那些致力于探索和理解其奇异、外星建筑中的模式的入门者们承诺知识。但是，尽管它提供奖励和力量，就像魔兽对凡人的承诺一样，但他们每迈出一步朝着启示的进展，就会越陷越深，无意中将自己与之绑定，直到他们在不知不觉中被物理地束缚，再也无法离开而不屈服，无论以何种方式。",
	"Only 6 miles wide in its entirety, roughly half of that space is beholden to the ruins of an utterly ancient fortress of alien design and its surrounding debris field of bones, seemingly comprised of the remains of every known creature, save those of any yugoloth. As befitting its extreme age, much of the structure has fallen to rubble, though the central ruins are in better condition due to a deep swath of protective wards that keep portions intact and standing, even with the absence of proper load-bearing support. Of the keep itself, its plan is a series of labyrinthine, spiraling corridors, both aboveground and passages burrowing deep below, with a central chamber, several acres wide, open to the looming, roiling sky above. Surrounding the keep are a pentad of slender ancillary towers, of which one is toppled. And another is sheared off halfway up, as if some angry titan had swung at it with a fist millennia earlier, with the upper portion of the tower still suspended in the sky and a roughly 40-foot gap of missing stairwell and walls between it and the extant lower portion.": "整体上只有6英里宽，其中大约一半的空间被完全古老的外星堡垒及其周围的骨骼碎片所占据，这些骨骼看似由每一种已知生物的遗骸组成，但没有任何(`yugoloth`)的遗骸。与其极高的年龄相称，结构的大部分已经倒塌，尽管中央废墟由于一道深刻的保护结界保持着一定的完整性和立场，即使缺乏适当的承重支撑也能保持站立。堡垒本身的平面图是一系列迷宫般的螺旋走廊，既有地上的，也有深深挖掘的地下通道，中央大厅数英亩宽，通向上方苍穹的巨大、翻滚的天空。围绕着堡垒的是五座纤细的辅助塔楼，其中一座倒塌了。另一座在半路上被削断，仿佛数千年前某个愤怒的泰坦用拳头击打过它，塔楼的上半部仍悬挂在天空中，上下两部分之间有大约40英尺的缺失楼梯和墙壁。",
	"Runes in the yugoloth dialect of Void Speech spiral across every inch of stone, carved by thousands of different hands, crowding against one another for position and bizarrely appearing on the undersides of fallen stones as well, not just what would have been exposed surfaces in the original structure. The nature of the carvings varies. Most of them are elaborate prayers for various of the Ibshalek, including some either no longer extant or potentially counted among the Waiting Ones, some are tantalizing promises, some are magical formulae of deeply obscure purpose, and still others are warnings directed toward the reader. One motif is repeated, especially upon the ruined entrances, \"Travel the path supplicant, seeking and finding. Know and transcend. Know and find freedom.\" The direct translation of freedom in the yugoloth tongue is dubious and can mean a number of related concepts from \"release from slavery\" to \"knowledge\" to \"oblivion,\" and the specific wording is reported to change when observed by different readers.": "虚空语言中的尤戈洛斯方言符文螺旋式地覆盖在每一寸石头上，被成千上万双不同的手雕刻而成，它们互相挤压以争夺位置，奇异地出现在倒塌石块的底部，而不仅仅是原始结构中本应暴露在外的表面。这些雕刻的性质各不相同。其中大部分是对伊布沙莱克的各种复杂祈祷，包括一些已不复存在或潜在被列为等待者之一的存在，有些是诱人的承诺，有些是深奥目的的魔法公式，还有一些是针对读者的警告。一个主题被反复出现，尤其是在废墟入口上，“沿着路径前行，谦卑地寻找和发现。了解并超越。了解并获得自由。”在尤戈洛斯语中，“自由”的直译是可疑的，可能代表从“解脱奴役”到“知识”再到“遗忘”等一系列相关概念，据报道，当不同的读者观察时，具体措辞会发生变化。",
	"The Broken Path has no apparent native life. Whatever purpose it held for its original builders, it is seemingly abandoned, and only the occasional planar traveler is found within. There is, however, evidence of past occupation, both by mortal explorers and by yugoloth pilgrims. The former litter the ruins' periphery with abandoned and still half-stocked campsites, suggesting that they hurriedly fled or never actually left while the latter leave behind numerous impromptu shrines to the Ibshalek, including sacrifices of all manner of sentient creatures and a panoply of scattered ritual materials, the aftermath of religious rites of a distinctly yugoloth flavor.": "破碎之路似乎没有明显的本地生命。无论它对原始建造者有什么目的，它似乎被遗弃了，只有偶尔会发现一些位面旅行者。然而，有过过去占据的证据，既有凡间探险者，也有犹格洛斯朝圣者。前者在废墟周围散落着被遗弃且仍半满的营地，暗示他们匆忙逃离或根本没有离开，而后者则留下了许多即兴的伊布沙勒克神龛，包括各种有知觉生物的牺牲和散落的各种仪式材料，这是犹格洛斯风味宗教仪式的后果。",
	"There are two caveats to this absence of native life. Visitors over the past century report one permanent resident, a disheveled human wizard by the name of Verig Renelik. Obsessed with the Broken Path, the wizard is prone to long, meandering diatribes to himself, his familiar, and non-existent persons who may have been former—though now missing—companions. Left to his own devices, he is non-violent, but if interfered with, he is merciless. Visitors describe him rambling on and on about some great reward promised to him, some unknown truth that he has learned that is otherwise reserved for the Ibshalek themselves. Powerful and paranoid, Verig is convinced that he is close to discovering some final hidden and powerful truth. Often dismissed as mad, others are convinced by one curious realization: the wizard has apparently not aged over the course of the past 200 years, despite the normal flow of time within the Broken Path.": "这种没有本地生物的情况有两个要点。过去一个世纪来的访客报告说有一位常驻居民，一个名叫(Verig Renelik)的邋遢人类巫师。这位巫师痴迷于(破碎之路)，倾向于对自己、他的使魔以及可能曾是他前任——尽管现在失踪了——同伴的不存在人士进行冗长而漫无目的的长篇抨击。让他自生自灭的话，他是非暴力的，但如果被干涉，他会毫不留情。访客描述他不停地唠叨着关于某种伟大奖励的事情，关于他所学到的某种未知真相，这些真相据说只有(Ibshalek)自己才知道。(Verig)强大而偏执，他坚信自己快要发现某种最终隐藏而强大的真相。他经常被认为是疯狂的，但其他人被一个奇怪的发现所说服：尽管(破碎之路)内时间正常流逝，这位巫师在过去200年里似乎没有变老。",
	"The other caveat resides in the wizard's familiar, Xera, an {@creature ezkiloth|W29PB}. This tiny yugoloth urges on its master's obsession and claims to be the fruit of his advanced understanding of the Broken Path's obfuscated truths. If the demiplane generates yugoloth familiars for those visitors who follow the path, so to speak, it would lend credence to there actually being a dark and hidden truth waiting for the worthy to understand.": "另一个注意事项在于巫师的使魔，泽拉(Xera)，一只{@creature ezkiloth|W29PB}。这只微小的尤戈洛斯怂恿着它主人的执念，并声称自己是对破碎之路混淆真相高级理解的成果。如果半位面为那些遵循这条道路的访客生成尤戈洛斯使魔，那么实际上会支持这样一种观点：暗藏着一种黑暗而隐秘的真相，等待着有资格理解的人去发现。",
	"So what is that truth? Is it a honey trap to lure powerful and ambitious mortals and, there, bind their souls and thus them into fiendish service? Is a powerful yugoloth, perhaps even one of the so-called Waiting Ones, lurking secluded deep within its core, luring powerful victims to an unknown end? As with everything involving the 'loths, every deeper exploration, like the Broken Path itself, brings no answers but only an ever-deeper and more dangerous level of questions.": "那么，这个真相是什么呢？它是一个蜜罐，用来诱使强大而野心勃勃的凡人，并将他们的灵魂捆绑，从而让他们为邪恶服务吗？是一个强大的尤戈洛斯，也许甚至是所谓的等待者之一，潜伏在其核心深处，引诱强大的受害者走向未知的结局吗？就像涉及“洛斯”的一切一样，每一次更深入的探索，就像破碎之路本身一样，都没有答案，只有更深层次和更危险的问题。",
