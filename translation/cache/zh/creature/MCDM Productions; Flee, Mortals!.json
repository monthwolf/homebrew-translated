	"Good news! If you've run fifth edition, then you already understand how to use most of the creatures in this book. You may see a few unfamiliar details, but fear not: this introduction covers everything that's new, and the tweaks we made to creature stat blocks don't take much time at all to grok.": "好消息！如果你已经玩过第五版，那么你已经了解如何使用本书中的大多数生物了。你可能会看到一些陌生的细节，但不用担心：这个介绍涵盖了所有新内容，我们对生物属性块所做的调整并不需要花费太多时间来理解。",
	"Beyond this introduction, this book is organized into four chapters:": "除了这个介绍，这本书分为四个章节：",
	"{@b {@book Chapter 1: Creatures|FleeMortals|1}.} The bulk of this book contains the MCDM version of classic fantasy creatures like griffons and goblins, along with new creatures of our own design, like mournlings and valok.": "{@b {@book Chapter 1: Creatures|FleeMortals|1}。这本书的大部分内容包括了类似狮鹫和地精这样的经典幻想生物的MCDM版本，还有我们自己设计的新生物，比如哀悼者和瓦洛克。",
	"{@b {@book Chapter 2: Environments|FleeMortals|2}.} The eight environments in this book present even more creatures! These are found in specific adventuring environments, like ruined keeps and sewers. Most environments also suggest traits and lair actions you can add to existing creatures.": "{@b {@book Chapter 2: Environments|FleeMortals|2}。} 这本书中的八个环境呈现了更多的生物！这些生物出现在特定的冒险环境中，比如废墟和下水道。大多数环境还建议您为现有生物添加特征和巢穴动作。",
	"{@b {@book Chapter 3: Villain Parties|FleeMortals|3}.} Challenge the player characters with a party of your own! Each of the seven villain parties has five NPCs with their own stories and unique stat blocks.": "{@b {@book Chapter 3: Villain Parties|FleeMortals|3}.} 用你自己的一组角色挑战玩家角色！每个七个恶棍小队都有五个NPC，他们有自己的故事和独特的属性块。",
	"{@b {@book Chapter 4: New Psionic Powers|FleeMortals|4}.} If a player in your game has a talent character who uses the rules in {@i The Talent and Psionics} from MCDM, they can learn new powers from the psionic creatures in this book. You can find out more about {@i The Talent and Psionics} at {@link mcdm.gg/talent}.": "{@b {@book Chapter 4: New Psionic Powers|FleeMortals|4}.} 如果你的游戏中有一名天赋角色使用了MCDM中{@i The Talent and Psionics}的规则，他们可以从本书中的智力生物那里学习新的能力。您可以在{@link mcdm.gg/talent}了解更多关于{@i The Talent and Psionics}的信息。",
	"The creatures in this book generally follow the core rules, but we've made a few tweaks. These new rules and presentation styles are designed to make combat encounters easier to run, more fun, and more memorable.": "这本书中的生物通常遵循核心规则，但我们进行了一些调整。这些新规则和呈现风格旨在使战斗遭遇更易于运行，更有趣，更令人难忘。",
	"The effects in this book sometimes target just allies or enemies. A creature is your {@b ally} if they're inclined to help you or fight alongside you—or if you believe they're inclined to do so. However, you are not your own ally, so if you target your allies with an effect, it doesn't affect you. A creature is your {@b enemy} if they're inclined to oppose you or fight against you—or if you either believe they're inclined to do so, or you plan to pick a fight with them regardless. If in doubt, it's up to the GM to decide whether a creature counts as an ally, an enemy, or neither.": "这本书中的效果有时只针对盟友或敌人。如果一名生物倾向于帮助你或与你并肩作战，或者你认为他们倾向于这样做，那么他们就是你的{@b ally}。然而，你不是自己的盟友，所以如果你以效果影响你的盟友，它不会影响到你自己。如果一名生物倾向于反对你或与你作对，或者你认为他们倾向于这样做，或者你计划无论如何都要与他们发生冲突，那么他们就是你的{@b enemy}。如果有疑问，由GM决定一名生物是盟友、敌人还是两者都不是。",
	"Each creature's stat block lists their challenge rating in the top right corner. The more obvious placement of the challenge rating makes it easier to find stat blocks and build encounters to challenge your players.": "每个生物的属性块在右上角列出了它们的挑战等级（Challenge Rating）。挑战等级的更明显位置使得更容易找到属性块，并建立能够挑战玩家的遭遇。",
	"Some of the creatures in this book inflict—or are immune to—the following new conditions.": "这本书中的一些生物会施加或免疫以下新状态。",
	"Each creature has a role listed next to their challenge rating. Roles are descriptive and most don't follow special rules—they simply help you build encounters and use the creature effectively in combat.": "每个生物的挑战等级旁边都列有一个角色。角色是描述性的，大多数不遵循特殊规则——它们只是帮助您构建遭遇并有效地在战斗中使用生物。",
	"Ambushers are creatures who hide well—not just before an encounter, but during it. They utilize surprise and stealth to gain the upper hand.": "伏击者是擅长藏匿的生物，不仅在遭遇前，甚至在遭遇中也能保持隐蔽。它们利用突袭和隐秘手段来占据上风。",
	"Artillery creatures fight best from afar. Whether they wield arrows or magical rays, these creatures always try to keep a distance from their foes.": "炮兵生物最擅长远程作战。无论是使用箭矢还是魔法射线，这些生物总是试图与敌人保持一定距离。",
	"Brutes are hardy creatures who have lots of hit points and deal lots of damage. They might not be the most disciplined warriors, but they make up for it with sheer toughness and aggression.": "蛮族是强壮的生物，拥有大量生命值并造成大量伤害。他们可能不是最有纪律的战士，但他们以极高的坚韧和攻击性弥补了这一点。",
	"Companion creatures are meant to accompany player characters on adventures. For more information, see the \"Companion Creatures\" section.": "同伴生物旨在陪伴玩家角色进行冒险。有关更多信息，请参阅“同伴生物”部分。",
	"Controllers debuff, move, and obstruct their enemies. They often have crowd-control actions that apply a debilitating effect or target multiple creatures at once.": "控制者（Controllers）会削弱、移动和阻碍他们的敌人。他们通常拥有可以施加虚弱效果或同时影响多个生物的控场动作。",
	"A leader is an action-oriented creature who fights alongside underlings. For more information, see the \"Action-Oriented Creatures\" section.": "领袖是一个以行动为导向的生物，与部属并肩作战。有关更多信息，请参阅“行动导向生物”部分。",
	"Minions are weak creatures who find strength in numbers. For more information, see the \"Minions\" section.": "小喽啰是弱小的生物，它们在数量上寻找力量。更多信息请参阅“小喽啰”部分。",
	"Retainers are sapient beings meant to accompany player characters on adventures. For more information, see the \"Retainers\" section.": "随从是有智慧的生物，旨在陪伴玩家角色进行冒险。有关更多信息，请参阅“随从”部分。",
	"Skirmishers are mobile warriors who use hit-and-run tactics in combat. Their traits allow them to make the most of their position.": "游击队员是在战斗中使用游击战术的机动战士。他们的特质使他们能够充分利用自己的位置。",
	"Soldiers are well-armored creatures who draw the attacks of their foes, freeing allies to move around the battlefield. These trained warriors typically have higher attack bonuses and AC.": "士兵是穿着厚重盔甲的生物，他们吸引敌人的攻击，让盟友可以在战场上自由移动。这些训练有素的战士通常具有更高的攻击加值和护甲等级（AC）。",
	"A solo creature is an action-oriented creature who can take on the player characters on their own. For more information, see the \"Action-Oriented Creatures\" section.": "一个独行生物是一个行动导向的生物，可以独自对抗玩家角色。更多信息，请参阅\"行动导向生物\"部分。",
	"Support creatures aid their allies, providing buffs, healing, movement, or action options.": "支援生物帮助他们的盟友，提供增益效果、治疗、移动或行动选择。",
	"This book uses the term {@b mundane} to refer to attacks, items, and other effects that aren't magical or psionic.": "这本书使用术语{@b mundane}来指代非魔法或灵能的攻击、物品和其他效果。",
	"On the other hand, the term {@b supernatural} describes an effect or item that is either magical or psionic. For instance, a creature's stat block might say they're resistant to \"bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from mundane attacks.\" This means that when you deal them bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage using a spell, power, magic weapon, or psionic weapon, the damage is supernatural and thus the creature isn't resistant to it.": "另一方面，术语{@b supernatural}描述的是一种魔法或灵能效果或物品。例如，生物的属性块可能会说他们对“来自普通攻击的钝击、穿刺和挥砍伤害”具有抗性。这意味着当你使用法术、能力、魔法武器或灵能武器对它们造成钝击、穿刺或挥砍伤害时，伤害是超自然的，因此生物对此没有抗性。",
	"The core rules often use the singular pronoun \"it\" to refer to a single creature. This book instead uses the singular \"they\" to clearly delineate between creatures and objects. Objects still use \"it\" as a singular pronoun.": "核心规则通常使用单数代词“it”来指代单个生物。而本书则使用单数代词“they”来明确区分生物和物体。物体仍然使用“it”作为单数代词。",
	"Some creatures have psionic powers, creating effects with sheer force of will instead of with magic. When a creature manifests a power, they create an effect that has similar rules to casting spells, with the following exceptions.": "一些生物拥有灵能力量，凭借意志的纯粹力量产生效果，而不是使用魔法。当一个生物施展一项能力时，他们产生的效果与施放法术有类似的规则，但有以下例外情况。",
	"Powers don't create magical effects, so they're unaffected by features and spells like {@spell antimagic field}, {@spell counterspell}, and {@spell dispel magic}. The damage from a power attack isn't magical. If a rule affects only spells or magical effects, it doesn't affect powers. However, psionic powers are supernatural, so if a rule affects supernatural effects, it does affect powers (see \"Mundane and Supernatural\").": "能力不会产生魔法效果，因此不受 {@spell antimagic field}、{@spell counterspell} 和 {@spell dispel magic} 等特性和法术的影响。能力攻击造成的伤害也不是魔法伤害。如果一条规则只影响法术或魔法效果，那么它不会影响能力。然而，灵能能力是超自然的，所以如果一条规则影响超自然效果，它会影响能力（见《凡俗与超自然》）。",
	"Every power has an {@b order} that is an expression of its level of strength. Powers of the 1st order are the weakest (equivalent to cantrips in strength), and 6th-order powers are the strongest.": "每种力量都有一个{@b order}，这是它力量级别的表达。第一级别的力量是最弱的（相当于(cantrips)的力量），而第六级别的力量是最强的。",
	"If a stat block feature should be considered a power, its order is noted in parentheses.": "如果一个属性块功能应该被视为一种能力，它的顺序会在括号中注明。",
	"Powers don't have material, somatic, or verbal components.": "能力没有材料、身体动作或语言成分。(Powers)",
	"Unlike player characters, if a creature's stat block allows them to manifest a power as a bonus action, they can still manifest another power of 2nd order or higher as an action on that turn. For example, a creature who manifests the jaunt power as a bonus action can also make a 2nd-order power attack as an action. Similarly, many Multiattack actions let a creature make multiple power attacks on a turn, even though each attack is a power of its own.": "与玩家角色不同，如果生物的属性块允许它们将一项力量表现为奖励动作，它们仍然可以在那个回合的行动中将另一项2级或更高级的力量表现为动作。例如，一只生物将瞬移力量表现为奖励动作，也可以在动作中进行第二级别的力量攻击。同样，许多多重攻击动作让生物在一个回合中进行多次力量攻击，尽管每次攻击都是独立的力量。",
	"When an enemy's movement provokes an opportunity attack from a creature whose stat block includes a melee power attack, the creature can use their reaction to make a melee power attack against the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack.": "当敌人的移动引发了一个机会攻击，而该生物的属性块包括近战强力攻击时，该生物可以使用它们的反应对该敌人进行一次近战强力攻击，而不是进行一次机会攻击。",
	"A character playing a talent—the class found in the MCDM supplement {@link The Talent and Psionics|https://mcdm.gg/talent}—can use the rules in that book to learn new powers from the creatures in {@i Flee, Mortals!} Powers that aren't in {@i The Talent and Psionics} are indicated in a creature's stat block with an asterisk (*) and provided in the \"New Psionic Powers\" chapter of this book.": "一个角色扮演一个天赋——MCDM补充资料中找到的职业{@link The Talent and Psionics|https://mcdm.gg/talent}——可以使用该书中的规则从{@i Flee, Mortals!}的生物那里学习新的能力。不在{@i The Talent and Psionics}中的能力在生物的属性块中用星号(*)标注，并在本书的“新灵能力”章节中提供。",
	"Some creatures have a trait or action that, on a failed saving throw, imposes a debilitating effect for an extended duration. But sometimes a lucky foe can retry their saving throw and potentially end the effect early. In such situations, the stat block specifies \"save ends at start of turn\" or \"save ends at end of turn.\"": "一些生物具有一种特质或行为，如果在豁免检定失败时，会施加长时间的虚弱效果。但有时候，幸运的敌人可以重新尝试豁免检定，并有可能提前结束效果。在这种情况下，属性块会指定“豁免检定在回合开始时结束”或“豁免检定在回合结束时结束”。",
	"When you see this phrase, it means any creature affected by a {@b save ends effect} like this can repeat the saving throw on each of their turns, ending the effect on themself early on a success. They can only make that saving throw either at the start or end of their turn, as specified in the stat block.": "当你看到这个短语时，意味着受到 {@b save ends effect} 影响的任何生物都可以在他们的每个回合上重复豁免扔骰，成功后可以提前结束自己身上的效果。他们只能在回合开始或结束时进行豁免扔骰，如状态块中所指定的那样。",
	"Here is an example of an attack with a save ends effect from the {@creature goblin cursespitter|FleeMortals} stat block:": "这是来自{@creature goblin cursespitter|FleeMortals}属性块的一个带有“存储结束”效果的攻击示例：",
	"{@b Toxic Touch (Cantrip).} {@atk ms,rs} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 2d6}) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn).": "{@b Toxic Touch (Cantrip).} {@atk ms,rs} {@hit 4} 攻击，达到5英尺或射程30英尺，一个目标。造成{@h}7 ({@damage 2d6}) 毒素伤害，并且目标必须成功通过一次{@dc 12} 体质豁免才能在1分钟内不动弹 (豁免在回合结束时结束)。",
	"Save ends effects are one way of saving space in stat blocks and making them less complex for GMs to run at the table. Much like how stat blocks just reference the poisoned condition instead of spelling its rules out each time, we didn't want to fill up the pages by repeating long sentences similar to this one: \"A target poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themself on a success.\"": "保存终结效果是在统计块中节省空间的一种方式，使它们对GM在桌上运行时更简单。就像统计块只是引用中毒状态而不是每次都拼写其规则一样，我们不想通过重复类似于这句话的长句来填满页面：“以这种方式中毒的目标可以在他们的每个回合结束时重复豁免检定，成功时结束对自己的效果。”",
	"Some creatures have magical actions, bonus actions, and reactions. When these features should be considered spells (for the purpose of {@spell counterspell}, {@spell dispel magic}, and similar effects), the spell level is noted in parentheses. If the spell requires concentration, this is also noted in parentheses. Unless otherwise noted, these spells have somatic and verbal components.": "一些生物具有魔法动作、奖励动作和反应。当这些特性被视为法术时（用于{@spell counterspell}、{@spell dispel magic}等效果），法术等级会用括号标注。如果法术需要集中注意力，也会在括号中注明。除非另有说明，这些法术都需要手势和语言组件。",
	"Unlike player characters, if a creature's stat block allows them to cast a spell as a bonus action, they can still cast another spell of 1st level or higher as an action on that turn. For example, a creature who casts the {@spell misty step} spell as a bonus action can also make a 2nd-level spell attack as an action. Similarly, many Multiattack actions let a creature make multiple spell attacks on a turn, even though each attack is a spell of its own.": "与玩家角色不同，如果生物的属性块允许它们将一个法术作为奖励动作施放，它们仍然可以在该回合将另一个1级或更高级别的法术作为动作施放。例如，一个生物如果将{@spell misty step}法术作为奖励动作施放，也可以在动作中进行一个2级法术攻击。同样，许多多重攻击动作允许生物在一个回合中进行多次法术攻击，尽管每次攻击都是独立的法术。",
	"When an enemy's movement provokes an opportunity attack from a creature whose stat block includes a melee spell attack, the creature can use their reaction to make a melee spell attack against the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack.": "当一个敌人的移动引发了一个生物的机会攻击，而该生物的属性块包括近战法术攻击时，该生物可以使用它们的反应对该敌人进行一次近战法术攻击，而不是进行一次机会攻击。",
	"In addition to combat-focused spells, some creatures can cast spells that are primarily used outside of combat. To streamline the stat blocks, these spells aren't written out in the creature's combat-oriented \"Actions\" section. Instead, their names are listed in a separate \"Utility Spells\" section at the end of the stat block. After each spell name, the casting time is indicated in superscript, as shown in the Casting Times table.": "除了以战斗为重点的法术外，一些生物还可以施放主要用于非战斗场景的法术。为了简化属性块，这些法术不会在生物的战斗导向的“行动”部分中详细列出。相反，它们的名称会在属性块末尾的单独的“实用法术”部分中列出。在每个法术名称后面，施法时间会以上标形式标明，如施法时间表所示。",
	"1 action": "1个动作 (1 action)",
	"1 bonus action": "1（bonus action）",
	"1 reaction": "1 反应 (reaction)",
	"Longer than 1 action (see spell description)": "超过1个动作（见法术描述）",
	"For example, a spellcaster's utility spells might appear as follows:": "例如，一个施法者的实用法术可能如下所示：",
	"1/day each: expeditious retreat{@sup B}, mage armor{@sup A}, phantom steed{@sup +}": "每天1次：加速撤退{@sup B}，魔法盔甲{@sup A}，幻影战马{@sup +}",
	"In this book, creature sections begin with broad descriptions for all the creatures in that section. While not all the information is common in-character knowledge, you can share these early pages with your players if you don't mind them having a little meta-knowledge.": "在这本书中，生物部分以所有该部分生物的广泛描述开头。虽然并非所有信息都是角色内知识，但如果你不介意玩家们有一些元知识，你可以与他们分享这些早期页面。",
	"The creature stat blocks aren't presented until the end of each section, allowing you to share flavorful information with your players and flip fewer pages when you run a band of similar creatures.": "生物属性块直到每个部分的末尾才呈现，这样您就可以与玩家分享有趣的信息，并在运行一群类似生物时翻动更少的页面。",
	"Stat blocks in the core rules often indicate when a creature has an unusual nature and doesn't require air, food, sleep, or water to live and function. To keep the stat blocks in this book succinct, we've omitted those traits from individual stat blocks. Instead, you can refer to the following list to determine each creature type's unusual needs (or lack thereof):": "核心规则中的属性块通常会指示生物是否具有异常特性，不需要空气、食物、睡眠或水来生存和运作。为了保持本书中的属性块简洁，我们已经从各个属性块中省略了这些特征。相反，您可以参考以下列表来确定每种生物类型的异常需求（或不需要）：",
	"{@b Construct.} Constructs don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "{@b Construct.}结构不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"{@b Elemental.} Elementals don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "{@b Elemental.} 元素生物不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"{@b Ooze.} Oozes don't require air or sleep.": "{@b Ooze.} 黏液怪不需要空气或睡眠。",
	"{@b Undead.} Undead don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "{@b Undead.} 不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"{@b Other Creature Types.} Unless otherwise specified, other creature types require air, food, drink, and sleep.": "{@b Other Creature Types.} 除非另有规定，其他生物类型需要空气、食物、饮水和睡眠。",
	"The solo and leader creatures presented in this book are designed to be bosses: enemies who can take on an entire party by themselves or with a handful of underlings. Rather than simply increasing the challenge rating (an approach that often leads to underwhelming encounters), this book introduces {@b action-oriented creatures.}": "本书中呈现的独行者和首领生物都被设计成boss：可以独自或带着一小群手下对抗整个队伍的敌人。与仅仅增加挑战等级（这种方法通常会导致令人失望的遭遇）不同，本书引入了{@b action-oriented creatures.}。",
	"A powerful villain needs plenty of opportunities to act and move when it's not their turn. Thus, each actionoriented creature has at least one special bonus action and reaction, as well as a special section with villain actions that let them dominate the battlefield.": "一个强大的反派需要有充足的机会在非自己回合时行动和移动。因此，每个以行动为导向的生物都至少有一个特殊的额外行动和反应，以及一个特殊部分包含反派行动，让他们能够主宰战场。",
	"These actions make the boss creatures dynamic and formidable. Whether fought as an exciting solo challenge or alongside a few easy-to-run underlings, action-oriented creatures challenge the characters with dramatic and powerful actions in combat.": "这些行动使得首领生物变得充满活力且强大。无论是作为一个令人兴奋的独立挑战，还是与一些易于操作的手下一起战斗，以行动为主的生物都会在战斗中用戏剧性和强大的行动挑战角色。",
	"Every action-oriented creature has three {@b villain actions} they can use after an enemy's turn. Villain actions are similar to legendary actions with the following exceptions:": "每个以行动为导向的生物在敌人回合后有三个可用的{@b villain actions}。反派行动类似于传奇行动，但有以下例外：",
	"A creature can use only one villain action per round (as such, villain actions tend to be more powerful than legendary actions).": "每个生物每回合只能使用一个恶棍动作（因此，恶棍动作往往比传奇动作更强大）。",
	"Each villain action can only be used once during a combat encounter.": "每个恶棍行动在一次战斗遭遇中只能使用一次。",
	"Like legendary actions, a creature can't use villain actions if incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions.": "与传奇动作类似，生物如果无法行动或无法采取行动，则无法使用反派动作。",
	"Each trio of villain actions has a recommended round order. These abilities give the battle a logical flow and a cinematic arc:": "每组恶棍行动都有推荐的回合顺序。这些能力赋予战斗一个逻辑的流程和电影般的弧线：",
	"The first villain action is an opener, which shows the characters they're not battling a typical creature. Openers generally deal some damage, summon a lackey or three, buff the boss, debuff the characters, or move the creature into an advantageous position. They're just a taste of what's to come.": "第一个恶棍行动是一个开场动作，向角色展示他们并不是在与典型生物战斗。开场动作通常会造成一些伤害，召唤一些手下，增强首领，削弱角色，或将生物移动到有利位置。它们只是未来战斗的一个小小预演。",
	"The second villain action provides crowd control. It typically fires after the heroes have had a chance to respond once or twice, get into position, and surround the villain. This second action helps the villain regain the upper hand. Like an opener, this action comes in many flavors, but it's even more powerful than an opener.": "第二个恶棍行动提供了人群控制。通常在英雄有机会回应一两次，进入位置并包围恶棍之后才会触发。这第二个行动帮助恶棍重新占据上风。就像一个开场白，这个行动有许多变种，但比开场白更加强大。",
	"The third and final villain action is an ultimate move or \"ult\"—a showstopper the villain can use to deal a devastating blow to the characters before the end of the battle.": "第三个也是最后一个反派动作是终极招式或者“终极技能”——反派可以利用它在战斗结束前对角色造成毁灭性打击。",
	"While every creature has a recommended order of actions, you can take villain actions in any order if it makes your fight more dramatic. You could push back a villain action if a creature is stunned or might stay alive for more than three rounds, or you could perform the recommended third action in round two after several surprise critical hits!": "尽管每个生物都有推荐的行动顺序，但如果让你的战斗更加戏剧化，你可以按任意顺序进行反派行动。例如，如果某个生物被眩晕或可能在三轮以上保持存活状态，你可以推迟反派行动，或者在第二轮执行推荐的第三个行动，之前经历了几次意外的重击！",
	"Many of the action-oriented creatures in this book are unique. They typically have a specific name and backstory, though you can ignore these if you wish to use the creature's stat block in another way in your campaign. For instance, {@creature Queen Bargnot|FleeMortals}'s stat block could be used for any action-oriented goblin in your game.": "这本书中许多以行动为主的生物都是独一无二的。它们通常有特定的名称和背景故事，但如果你希望在你的战役中以其他方式使用这些生物的属性块，你可以忽略这些。例如，{@creature Queen Bargnot|FleeMortals}的属性块可以用于你游戏中的任何行动导向的地精。",
	"A {@b companion} is a wild ally who adventures with characters. Each companion has unique traits and actions that make them a great ally. But beware! These creatures can be difficult to control in the heat of battle and just might bite the hand that feeds. Don't fret too much, though! A companion gelatinous cube or owlbear is worth the risk of an occasional wild rampage.": "一个{@b companion}是一个与角色一起冒险的野生盟友。每个同伴都有独特的特质和行动，使他们成为一个伟大的盟友。但要小心！这些生物在战斗的激烈中可能很难控制，甚至可能反噬喂养它们的手。不过不要太担心！一个伴侣凝胶立方体或猫头鹰熊是值得冒险偶尔的狂暴行为的风险。",
	"Every companion has a player character {@b caregiver} who commands the creature. The caregiver's player controls the companion most of the time during the game, though the GM can step in to take control if the companion and caregiver are separated, or if the caregiver mistreats the companion in some way.": "每个同伴都有一个玩家角色{@b caregiver}来指挥这个生物。照顾者的玩家在游戏中大部分时间控制着同伴，尽管如果同伴和照顾者分开，或者照顾者以某种方式虐待同伴，GM可以介入控制同伴。",
	"In combat, a companion shares a turn with their caregiver and acts during the caregiver's turn. A companion can move and use their own reaction and bonus action independently. But they can take only the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions unless their caregiver uses a bonus action to command the companion to take a different action, including any of the actions noted in the companion's stat block. A companion must be able to see or hear their caregiver to receive a command. A companion can also take other actions if their caregiver is incapacitated or if the companion enters a rampage (as discussed below).": "在战斗中，伙伴与他们的照顾者共享一个回合，并在照顾者的回合中行动。伙伴可以独立移动并使用自己的反应和奖励行动。但是，他们只能采取冲刺、躲闪或闪避动作，除非他们的照顾者使用奖励行动命令伙伴采取不同的动作，包括伙伴属性块中指定的任何动作。伙伴必须能够看到或听到他们的照顾者才能接收命令。如果伙伴的照顾者无法行动或者伙伴进入暴走状态（如下文所述），伙伴也可以采取其他行动。",
	"Companions are a lot of fun, but having more than one companion to manage can slow things down at the table. A companion is another member of the party, with statistics and actions to track, and additional companions can easily make combat slow to a crawl. If every player wants to get in on the companion action, it's simpler for the characters to take turns as a creature's caregiver, rather than running around adventuring with a menagerie.": "同伴很有趣，但要管理多个同伴可能会拖慢游戏进程。同伴是队伍中的另一个成员，需要追踪其属性和行动，额外的同伴可能会让战斗变得缓慢。如果每个玩家都想参与同伴行动，让角色轮流担任生物的照顾者会更简单，而不是带着一群动物四处冒险。",
	"For characters wishing to share a companion, the companion accepts a new caregiver at the end of a short or long rest. Because a companion's proficiency bonus and hit points depend on their caregiver's level, those statistics might fluctuate if the characters in a party are different levels, reflecting that a more experienced caregiver is more adept at directing a companion.": "对于希望分享同伴的角色，同伴在短暂或长时间休息结束时接受新的照顾者。由于同伴的熟练加值和生命值取决于他们照顾者的等级，如果团队中的角色等级不同，这些统计数据可能会波动，反映出经验更丰富的照顾者更擅长指导同伴。",
	"A caregiver who is charmed can still command their companion, but they can't command the companion to attack a creature who charmed them.": "一个被魅惑的看护者仍然可以指挥他们的同伴，但他们不能命令同伴攻击一个魅惑了他们的生物。",
	"If a companion's caregiver is incapacitated or dies, the GM determines who controls the companion—typically, the caregiver's player can maintain control of their companion as they take a heroic stand against the enemy.": "如果一个同伴的照料者无法行动或死亡，GM决定由谁来控制这个同伴——通常情况下，照料者的玩家可以继续控制他们的同伴，同时对抗敌人。",
	"However, in cases where a caregiver and their companion are physically separated, such as when a companion is captured, the GM might wish to take control of the companion to keep the player in suspense about the creature's fate.": "然而，在护理者和他们的同伴被物理分开的情况下，比如当一个同伴被捕获时，GM可能希望控制这个同伴，以保持玩家对这个生物命运的悬念。",
	"At the GM's discretion, a companion can abandon a caregiver character and choose a different willing creature as a caregiver.": "在GM的裁量下，一个同伴可以放弃一个照顾者角色，并选择另一个愿意的生物作为照顾者。",
	"Companions are dangerous creatures. Though often more docile than their wild counterparts, they aren't fully domesticated. Each companion's {@b ferocity} is a measure of their tenacity and fury, and of how those things build in battle. As a companion's ferocity increases, they gain access to powerful new actions, but they also become more difficult for a caregiver to control.": "同伴是危险的生物。虽然通常比它们的野生同类更温顺，但它们并非完全被驯化。每个同伴的{@b ferocity}代表了它们的坚韧和愤怒程度，以及这些在战斗中的积累。随着同伴凶猛程度的增加，它们将获得强大的新动作，但同时也变得更难为护理者所控制。",
	"If a companion isn't incapacitated at the start of their and their caregiver's turn, their ferocity increases by {@dice 1d4} + the number of enemies the companion can see or hear within 5 feet of them. For the purpose of increasing ferocity, a group of creatures who share a single stat block (such as a swarm of rats) counts as one creature. Ferocity increases round after round during combat, and there is no maximum to the level of ferocity a companion can gain.": "如果一个伙伴在他们和他们的照顾者的回合开始时没有被使无能化，他们的凶猛度会增加 {@dice 1d4} + 伙伴能看到或听到的敌人数量。对于增加凶猛度，共享相同属性块的一组生物（比如一群老鼠）算作一个生物。在战斗中，凶猛度会在每一轮后增加，伙伴可以获得的凶猛度等级没有上限。",
	"We can already tell that some crafty players are scheming to stuff a bag full of slightly groggy rats, then open that bag up in front of their companion to build up their ferocity during a fight. However, a too-easy target doesn't rile up a companion the way being threatened by an enemy combatant in a battle for survival does. As such, the GM makes the final decision as to what constitutes an enemy for the purpose of increasing a companion's ferocity. Likewise, in the same way a swarm of creatures is counted as a single creature for the purpose of increasing ferocity, the GM is free to determine that two or three weak creatures might count as only one creature for that purpose.": "我们已经可以看出一些狡猾的玩家正密谋将一袋略显昏沉的老鼠塞满，然后在战斗中打开这个袋子，以增加他们同伴的凶猛程度。然而，一个太容易的目标并不能像在生存之战中受到敌人威胁那样激怒同伴。因此，对于增加同伴凶猛度的目的，GM做出最终决定，什么构成敌人。同样，就像一群生物被视为单个生物来增加凶猛度一样，GM可以自由决定两三只弱小生物可能只算作一个生物。",
	"After rolling to increase ferocity at the start of their turn, if a companion has 10 ferocity or more and isn't incapacitated, they run the risk of entering a {@b rampage}. The companion's caregiver can make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check (no action required) to try to stop the companion from entering a rampage. To make the check, the caregiver must not be incapacitated, and the companion must be able to see or hear the caregiver. The DC for the check equals 5 + the companion's ferocity. On a success, the companion acts normally on their turn. On a failure, or if the caregiver doesn't make the check, the companion enters a rampage.": "在他们的回合开始时投掷以增加凶猛度后，如果一个同伴的凶猛度达到或超过10，并且没有被使无力，他们有可能进入{@b rampage}。同伴的照料者可以进行一次感知（动物处理）检定（无需动作）来尝试阻止同伴陷入暴走状态。进行检定时，照料者不能被使无力，而且同伴必须能看到或听到照料者。检定的难度等于5 + 同伴的凶猛度。检定成功时，同伴在他们的回合中表现正常。检定失败，或者照料者未进行检定时，同伴将进入暴走状态。",
	"When a companion enters a rampage, they immediately move up to their speed toward the nearest creature they can sense and attack that creature with their signature attack (see below), dealing extra damage equal to half their ferocity if the attack hits. If at least one ally and one enemy are nearest and equidistant to the companion, the caregiver's player rolls any die. On an odd number, the companion attacks an ally. On an even number, the companion attacks an enemy. The caregiver's player determines which specific equidistant ally or enemy the companion engages (and can choose their own character if they wish).": "当一个同伴进入暴走状态时，它们立即朝着它们可以感知到的最近的生物移动，速度为它们的速度，并使用它们的标志性攻击（见下文）攻击那个生物，如果攻击命中，则造成额外伤害，额外伤害等于它们凶猛度的一半。如果至少有一个盟友和一个敌人与同伴最近且距离相等，护理者的玩家投掷任意骰子。在奇数时，同伴攻击盟友。在偶数时，同伴攻击敌人。护理者的玩家决定同伴与哪个具体的距离相等的盟友或敌人交战（如果愿意，可以选择他们自己的角色）。",
	"A companion who can't reach a creature to attack while in a rampage uses the Dash action to move as far as they can toward the nearest creature they can sense. If a companion can't sense any potential targets, they move as far as they can in a random direction determined by the GM, avoiding danger.": "当一名伙伴在暴走状态下无法接近一个生物进行攻击时，他们可以使用冲刺动作，向着他们能感知到的最近的生物移动尽可能远的距离。如果一名伙伴无法感知到任何潜在目标，他们将向着由GM确定的随机方向移动尽可能远的距离，避开危险。",
	"When a companion who has entered a rampage resolves their action or ends their turn, their ferocity drops to 0 and they're no longer in a rampage.": "当一个进入暴走状态的同伴解决他们的行动或结束他们的回合时，他们的凶猛度降为0，不再处于暴走状态。",
	"To prevent a companion from entering a dangerous rampage, a caregiver has several options at their disposal for reducing the creature's ferocity.": "为了防止同伴陷入危险的暴走状态，照顾者有几种方法可以减少生物的凶猛程度。",
	"Each companion has three actions in their stat block that cost ferocity to use. To use one of these ferocity actions, the caregiver's character level must be equal to or greater than the ferocity action's level, and the companion must spend the necessary amount of ferocity before they use the action. If the companion doesn't have enough ferocity to spend, they can't use the action.": "每个同伴的属性块中都有三个消耗凶猛度的行动。要使用其中一个凶猛度行动，护理者的角色等级必须等于或高于该凶猛度行动的等级，并且同伴在使用该行动之前必须花费必要的凶猛度。如果同伴没有足够的凶猛度可用，他们就无法使用该行动。",
	"Ferocity actions always use the companion's action, meaning they can't be used as part of an opportunity attack. Ferocity actions can't be used while a companion is in a rampage.": "凶猛行动总是使用伙伴的行动，这意味着它们不能作为机会攻击的一部分使用。在伙伴处于暴走状态时，无法使用凶猛行动。",
	"When a combat encounter involving a companion ends and the companion isn't dying, the companion regains hit points equal to their ferocity, and their ferocity drops to 0. The GM determines when a combat encounter ends, typically at the point when creatures stop acting in initiative order.": "当涉及到伙伴的战斗遭遇结束且伙伴没有濒死时，伙伴会回复等同于他们的凶猛度的生命值，而他们的凶猛度会降为0。通常情况下，GM会决定何时结束战斗遭遇，一般是在生物停止按照先攻顺序行动的时候。",
	"When a companion is reduced to 0 hit points, they are dying and make death saving throws just as characters do. Thus, characters always have a chance to save their furry (or scaly, or slimy, or exoskeletony) friends' lives! If combat ends while a companion is dying, their ferocity drops to 0 but they don't regain hit points (see \"End of Combat\" above).": "当同伴的生命值降至0点时，它们会陷入濒死状态，并像角色一样进行死亡豁免投掷。因此，角色们总是有机会拯救他们毛茸茸（或鳞甲、黏滑或外骨骼）的朋友们的生命！如果在同伴濒死时战斗结束，它们的凶猛度降至0，但它们不会恢复生命值（参见上文的“战斗结束”）。",
	"In addition to their ferocity actions, a companion's statistics vary from the statistics of their wild counterparts. This makes a companion easier to run, keeps their power in line with other companions, and helps ensure companions never outshine the characters. As somewhat more social versions of wild creatures, companions are often cleverer and more versatile than their untamed counterparts.": "除了它们凶猛的行为之外，伙伴的属性与它们野生对应物的属性有所不同。这使得伙伴更容易管理，保持它们的力量与其他伙伴相当，并确保伙伴永远不会比角色更出色。作为野生生物的稍微社交化版本，伙伴通常比它们未被驯服的对应物更聪明和多才多艺。",
	"Most creatures without character classes have their Hit Die type determined by their size (d4 for Tiny creatures, d6 for Small creatures, and so forth). However, companions are special and use a d8 for Hit Dice regardless of size.": "大多数没有职业等级的生物的生命骰类型由它们的大小确定（微小生物为d4，小型生物为d6，依此类推）。然而，伙伴是特殊的，无论大小都使用d8作为生命骰。",
	"A companion shares a unique bond with their caregiver and can understand basic commands in one language chosen by the caregiver. However, the companion can't read, speak, or write any language, even if similar creatures normally can.": "一个伙伴与他们的照顾者分享着独特的纽带，并且可以理解照顾者选择的一种语言中的基本指令。然而，这个伙伴无法阅读、说话或书写任何语言，即使通常类似的生物可以。",
	"Because a companion's effectiveness and survivability depend on the training and expertise of their caregiver, a companion's proficiency bonus is equal to their caregiver's proficiency bonus. Additionally, some of a companion's statistics refer to their proficiency bonus, abbreviated as PB. Other statistics use a number of dice equal to a companion's proficiency bonus; these are expressed with PB in place of the number of dice. For example, if a companion has a +2 proficiency bonus, PBd6 means 2d6.": "因为一个同伴的效力和生存能力取决于其照顾者的训练和专业知识，一个同伴的熟练加值等同于其照顾者的熟练加值。此外，一些同伴的属性与其熟练加值有关，简写为PB。其他属性使用与同伴的熟练加值相等的骰子数量；这些属性用PB代替骰子的数量。例如，如果一个同伴有+2的熟练加值，PBd6表示2d6。",
	"Each companion has an action designated as their signature attack. A signature attack is always a melee attack, and it's typically the creature's best natural attack. A companion uses their signature attack when they enter a rampage.": "每位同伴都有一个被指定为他们的标志性攻击的动作。标志性攻击总是一次近战攻击，通常是生物的最佳自然攻击。当同伴进入暴走状态时，它们会使用他们的标志性攻击。",
	"Each companion also has special actions that they can use only by spending ferocity during their turn, with some of those actions making use of the companion's signature attack. See \"Reducing Ferocity\" above for more information on ferocity actions.": "每位同伴还有特殊动作，只能在他们的回合中通过消耗凶猛度来使用，其中一些动作利用了同伴的标志性攻击。有关凶猛度动作的更多信息，请参阅上文中的“减少凶猛度”。",
	"Many companions are large enough to ride, especially by caregivers who are Small, when outfitted with an exotic saddle similar to those worn by aquatic or flying mounts. When a caregiver rides a companion into combat, not much actually changes. The caregiver and companion still each act on the same turn, and the caregiver must use their bonus action to direct the companion to take any action other than the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions. Under some circumstances, a companion might allow themself to be ridden by a creature other than their caregiver, though that other creature can't give the companion commands.": "许多同伴足够大，可以供骑乘，尤其是当照顾者是小型生物时，当它们配备类似水生或飞行坐骑所使用的异国鞍具时。当照顾者骑乘同伴参与战斗时，实际上并没有太多变化。照顾者和同伴仍然在同一个回合中行动，照顾者必须使用他们的奖励动作来指挥同伴执行除冲刺、脱离战斗或躲闪动作之外的任何动作。在某些情况下，同伴可能允许其他生物骑乘，尽管其他生物无法给同伴指令。",
	"If a companion rampages while bearing a rider, that rider counts as being within 5 feet of the companion when determining which creature the companion attacks. If a companion attacks their rider, they have disadvantage on the attack roll.": "如果同伴在承载骑乘者时暴走，那么当确定同伴攻击哪个生物时，骑乘者被视为与同伴在5英尺范围内。如果同伴攻击它们的骑乘者，它们在攻击检定中具有劣势。",
	"At the GM's discretion, characters can purchase barding for a companion, as discussed in the core rules, with the following adjustments:": "在(GM)的酌情下，角色可以为伙伴购买马甲，如核心规则中所讨论的那样，但有以下调整：",
	"Barding for Small companions weighs half as much as the equivalent armor for Humanoids. Barding for Medium companions weighs the same as Humanoid armor, while barding for Large companions weighs four times as much.": "小型伙伴的马铠重量是等效人形护甲的一半。中型伙伴的马铠重量与人形护甲相同，而大型伙伴的马铠重量是人形护甲的四倍。",
	"Companions are proficient in any barding they wear.": "同伴在穿戴任何护甲时都能熟练使用。",
	"When a companion wears barding, they don't add their caregiver's proficiency bonus to their AC.": "当伙伴穿戴马甲时，它们不会将其照料者的熟练加值加到它们的AC上。",
	"Companions who are shapechangers (such as the mimic companion) can't use that ability while wearing barding.": "变形的同伴（如拟态同伴）在穿着马铠时无法使用该能力。",
	"Companions who have corrosive bodies or are amorphous (such as the gelatinous cube companion) can't wear nonmagical barding.": "具有腐蚀性身体或是无定形的同伴（比如明胶立方体同伴）不能穿戴非魔法马甲。",
	"Unless a caregiver has the {@class beastheart|BST} class (found in {@link Beastheart and Monstrous Companions|https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/products/beastheart-companions}), the GM should consider a companion as akin to a powerful combat-focused magic item when building encounters. A companion gives a party a significant power boost, not just by dishing out more damage and providing more hit points for enemies to target, but also by creating complications that can make a fight more challenging for the party's foes. GMs can adjust encounter difficulty by one step (from easy to medium, hard to deadly, and so forth) to properly challenge a group of characters with a companion, particularly if the characters' average level is 7th or lower.": "除非照顾者拥有{@class beastheart|BST}职业（在{@link Beastheart and Monstrous Companions|https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/products/beastheart-companions}中找到），GM应该将同伴视为一个强大的以战斗为重点的魔法物品，当构建遭遇时。同伴不仅通过造成更多伤害和提供更多生命值供敌人攻击来显著增强队伍的力量，还通过制造复杂情况使战斗对队伍的敌人更具挑战性。GM可以调整遭遇难度一步（从简单到中等，从困难到致命等等）来适当挑战带有同伴的角色组，特别是如果角色的平均等级为第7级或更低。",
	"Companion creatures are designed to accompany player characters on adventures. If an NPC has a pet or creature servant, it's recommended you use the creature's normal stat block.

	"Overkill attacks can't be made as part of an opportunity attack.": "过度攻击不能作为机会攻击的一部分。",
	"Minions must be within a certain range to qualify for an overkill attack, determined by whether the attack is a melee or ranged attack. In addition to the examples below, the \"Overkill Damage Illustrated\" sidebar demonstrates how to calculate overkill damage.": "小喽啰必须在一定范围内才能符合超杀攻击的条件，这取决于攻击是近战还是远程攻击。除了以下示例外，“超杀伤害示例”侧边栏展示了如何计算超杀伤害。",
	"When a creature hits a minion with a melee weapon attack, other minions within reach of the attack are in {@b overkill range} and can be chosen as additional targets for an overkill attack. The overkill attack can't target minions outside the weapon attack's reach.": "当一个生物用近战武器攻击打中一个爪牙时，攻击范围内的其他爪牙处于{@b overkill range}状态，并可以被选择作为超杀攻击的额外目标。超杀攻击不能选择超出武器攻击范围之外的爪牙。",
	"When a creature hits a minion with a ranged weapon attack, other minions in a line originating from the creature in the direction of the target, to a distance equal to the weapon's short range, are in {@b overkill range} and can be chosen as additional targets for an overkill attack. The overkill attack can't target minions outside the line or beyond the weapon's short range.": "当一个生物用远程武器攻击击中一个手下时，从该生物起始的直线上的其他手下，朝着目标方向延伸到武器的短程距离内，处于{@b overkill range}状态，并可以被选择作为超杀攻击的额外目标。超杀攻击不能以线外或超出武器短程距离的手下为目标。",
	"You might ask, why not just give minions 1 hit point and take no damage when they save for half, like in fourth edition? First, spells that use a creature's hit points to determine effectiveness—like {@spell color spray} and {@spell sleep}—would devastate all minions, even those meant to challenge high-level characters. These spells are still effective againstminions, just not devastating!": "你可能会问，为什么不像第四版那样，给爪牙们1点生命值，当它们成功豁免只受一半伤害呢？首先，像{@spell color spray}和{@spell sleep}这样使用生物生命值来决定效果的法术会摧毁所有爪牙，即使是那些旨在挑战高级角色的爪牙。这些法术对爪牙仍然有效，只是不会造成毁灭性的伤害！",
	"Second, spells and effects that deal damage without any attack roll or save—like {@spell magic missile} and {@spell spike growth}—would lay waste to minions with 1 hit point. This fits the fiction for minions with low challenge ratings, like goblins and zombies. But the balance of combat and fiction breaks down to near-silliness at higher levels when the same spells easily take down powerful devil minions.": "其次，像{@spell magic missile}和{@spell spike growth}这样不需要攻击骰或豁免骰就能造成伤害的法术和效果会轻易摧毁只有1点生命值的爪牙。这适用于具有低挑战等级的爪牙，比如地精和僵尸。但是在高等级时，同样的法术却轻松击倒强大的恶魔爪牙，这破坏了战斗和故事情节之间的平衡，近乎荒谬。",
	"Finally, high-level spells with a save for half damage—like {@spell fireball} or {@spell meteor swarm}—would feel wasted against minions with 1 hit point. Why use a higher-level spell when a lower-level one will do? Similarly, the fourth edition design could lead to a kobold minion illogically surviving a fireball spell while a \"stronger\" standard kobold next to them dies, despite both creatures succeeding on their saving throw. By contrast, under this book's minion rules, spellcasters still have a good reason to use high-level spells against minions.": "最后，对半伤害进行豁免的高级法术——比如{@spell fireball}或{@spell meteor swarm}——在对付只有1点生命值的爪牙时会感觉浪费。当低级法术就能胜任时，为什么要使用高级法术呢？同样地，第四版的设计可能导致一个龙族爪牙在火球法术中毫发无伤，而旁边的一个“更强壮”的标准龙族却死了，尽管这两个生物都成功通过了豁免检定。相比之下，在本书的爪牙规则下，法师们仍然有充分理由对付爪牙使用高级法术。",

	"Imagine a fighter is making a melee attack with a shortsword against a lackey, and two more lackeys are within overkill range of that attack. Each lackey is a minion with 6 hit points. In example A, the attack hits and deals 4 piercing damage. This kills only the targeted lackey. A successful attack against a minion always kills the target.": "想象一名战士用短剑对一个手下进行近战攻击，而另外两个手下正好处于攻击的过度杀伤范围内。每个手下都是一个拥有6点生命值的爪牙。在示例A中，攻击命中并造成4点穿刺伤害。这只杀死了被攻击的手下。对手下的成功攻击总是会杀死目标。",
	"In example B, the attack is a critical hit and deals 13 piercing damage. This kills the targeted lackey with 7 overkill damage remaining, which spreads to the other minions within the fighter's overkill range. So a second lackey within 5 feet of the fighter takes 6 piercing damage and dies, leaving 1 overkill damage remaining. The third lackey takes that last point of overkill damage and dies.": "在例子B中，这次攻击是一个暴击，造成13点穿刺伤害。这杀死了目标手下，还剩7点过量伤害，这些伤害会传播到战士过量伤害范围内的其他手下。所以，距离战士5英尺以内的第二个手下受到6点穿刺伤害并死亡，剩下1点过量伤害。第三个手下受到最后一点过量伤害并死亡。",
	"Each minion has at least one group attack action that speeds up play. In a group attack, two to five minions of the same stat block who share a turn can all use their action to join the attack, provided the target is within the original attack's reach or range for each minion.": "每个爪牙至少有一个群体攻击动作，可以加快游戏节奏。在群体攻击中，共享一个回合的两到五个拥有相同属性的爪牙可以共同使用他们的动作进行攻击，前提是目标在每个爪牙的原始攻击范围内。",
	"Make a single attack roll for the group attack. It counts as one attack.": "为团队攻击进行一次攻击检定。这算作一次攻击。",
	"A group attack roll gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll for each minion who joins the attack. (For example, if four goblin minions make a group attack together, the attack roll has a +4 bonus.)": "每个加入攻击的小喽啰都会为团队攻击投骰获得+1的奖励。（例如，如果四个哥布林小喽啰一起进行团队攻击，攻击投骰会获得+4的奖励。）",
	"If the group attack hits, multiply the damage by the number of minions who joined that group attack. (For example, if four goblin minions hit with a group attack that deals {@damage 1} damage, their group attack deals {@damage 4} damage.)": "如果团队攻击命中，将伤害乘以参与该团队攻击的小喽啰数量。（例如，如果四个哥布林小喽啰使用一个造成{@damage 1}伤害的团队攻击命中，他们的团队攻击将造成{@damage 4}伤害。）",
	"The GM decides how many minions join a group attack. For instance, if five minions surround a target, the GM may decide to have all five attack at once to speed up combat, or may break up the attacks among smaller groups to increase the odds that some minions hit while others miss. A single minion can even use their group attack action on their own—they make the attack as a normal creature would, and simply don't benefit from the group bonuses described above.": "GM决定有多少随从参与团体攻击。例如，如果有五个随从包围一个目标，GM可以决定让所有五个一起攻击以加快战斗速度，或者可以将攻击分配给较小的组，以增加一些随从命中而另一些随从未命中的几率。一个单独的随从甚至可以独自使用他们的团体攻击动作——他们像普通生物一样进行攻击，只是不会受益于上面描述的团体奖励。",
	"A group attack is only made with advantage or disadvantage if all the minions joining the group attack have advantage or disadvantage on the attack roll. Otherwise, the attack is made without advantage or disadvantage.": "只有当所有参与群体攻击的小怪兽在攻击骰投掷时都具有优势或劣势时，群体攻击才会带有优势或劣势。否则，攻击将不带有优势或劣势。",
	"If a target has cover or concealment from some but not all minions, the GM should divide the minions into multiple groups based on the type of cover or concealment they have, then make a separate attack for each group.": "如果目标对某些但不是所有的小喽啰有掩护或隐蔽，GM应根据它们所拥有的掩护或隐蔽类型将小喽啰分成多个组，然后为每个组进行单独的攻击。",
	"If a group attack triggers a reaction or similar effect that would normally affect a single attacker, such as the {@spell fire shield} or {@spell hellish rebuke} spell, the target of the group attack picks one minion who joined the attack to be affected by the effect.": "如果一个群体攻击触发了一个反应或类似效果，通常会影响单个攻击者，比如{@spell fire shield}或{@spell hellish rebuke}法术，那么群体攻击的目标选择一个参与攻击的随从来受到该效果的影响。",
	"If a creature provokes an opportunity attack from more than one minion of the same stat block at a time and those minions have a melee group attack action, the minions can each use their reaction to join a group attack as an opportunity attack.": "如果一个生物同时激怒了多个具有相同属性块的爪牙，而这些爪牙具有近战群体攻击动作，那么这些爪牙可以各自使用自己的反应作为机会攻击加入群体攻击。",
	"Though minions often make saving throws individually, there are times when rolling individual saving throws for each minion could slow down the fight, like when a cleric surrounded by eighteen shade minions uses Turn Undead.": "尽管手下通常会单独进行豁免投掷，但有时为每个手下单独投掷豁免投掷可能会减慢战斗速度，比如当一个被十八个暗影手下包围的牧师使用(转化不死生物)时。",
	"When many minions with the same stat block need to make a saving throw against the same effect at the same time, you can make one saving throw for a group of up to five minions at a time. All minions in a group use the result of the saving throw.": "当许多具有相同属性块的仆从需要同时对抗相同效果进行豁免检定时，您可以一次为多达五个仆从的一组进行一次豁免检定。组中的所有仆从使用豁免检定的结果。",
	"For instance, if thirty-four goblin minions need to make a saving throw against a hypnotic pattern spell, the minions would make a total of seven saving throws against the spell: six for thirty minions divided into six groups of five, and one more save for the remaining group of four minions.": "例如，如果三十四个地精爪牙需要对催眠图案法术进行豁免检定，这些地精会总共进行七次豁免检定：三十个地精分成六组每组五个，分别进行六次检定，剩下的四个地精再进行一次检定。",
	"Minions of a higher challenge rating, such as abyssal ghouls or fire giants, make for powerful foes. Consequently, it could break the game's verisimilitude for an NPC commoner to kill such a minion with a single attack. To keep minions believable, you can use the following rule.": "具有更高挑战等级的手下，比如深渊食尸鬼或火巨人，是强大的敌人。因此，如果一个NPC普通人能够用一次攻击杀死这样一个手下，可能会破坏游戏的真实感。为了使手下更加可信，您可以使用以下规则。",
	"When a minion's challenge rating is at least 6 higher than an NPC's challenge rating, that NPC's actions and traits affect a minion as if they didn't have the Minion trait, reducing the minion's hit points like a normal creature instead of automatically dropping them to 0.": "当一个爪牙的挑战等级至少比一个NPC的挑战等级高6级时，该NPC的行动和特征会影响爪牙，就好像它们没有`爪牙(Minion)`特征一样，减少爪牙的生命值，而不是自动将其降为0。",
	"This rule shouldn't be applied to player characters—they're heroes who can always kill a minion in one hit.": "这条规则不适用于玩家角色——他们是英雄，可以一击杀死一个爪牙。",
	"Many minions have traits that give them strength in numbers but become less powerful as their allies are defeated. For example, an enemy who starts their turn within 5 feet of three or more goblin lackeys must succeed on a saving throw or take damage from the lackeys' Tiny Stabs trait.": "许多爪牙具有特质，使它们在人数众多时变得更强大，但随着它们的盟友被击败，它们的力量会减弱。例如，一个敌人如果在与三个或更多哥布林走狗在5英尺内开始他们的回合，则必须成功通过豌豆尖刺特质的豌豆刺伤救嘉或受到伤害。",
	"Minions have a challenge rating just like any other creature. However, their experience point value depends on their challenge rating, as shown on the Minion Encounter Building table.

	"When the rules reference a challenge rating, such as the {@spell polymorph} spell or the cleric's Destroy Undead feature, use the minion's listed challenge rating as normal. For instance, a 5th-level cleric can affect Undead creatures with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower with their Destroy Undead feature—so this feature can affect rotting zombie minions (CR 1/4) but not shade minions (CR 1).": "当规则提到挑战等级时，比如{@spell polymorph}法术或牧师的《摧毁不死生物》特性，使用随从所列的挑战等级就好。例如，一个5级牧师可以用他们的《摧毁不死生物》特性影响挑战等级为1/2或更低的不死生物，所以这个特性可以影响腐烂僵尸随从（挑战等级1/4），但不能影响阴影随从（挑战等级1）。",

	"While it's tempting to pit your unsuspecting players against a horde of fire giants just to watch their eyes pop out of their faces in surprise, minion encounters are more fun overall if you share the rules for minions with your players before they get into an encounter.

	"A combat encounter with more than five minions per character can become deadly if all minions act on the same turn—the characters cut down minion hordes on their turns but then suffer massive damage as a sea of minions pour down on them. While many groups like this challenge, you have the option to divide the minions into different bands that act on different initiative counts. If you do this, minions can only join group attacks with minions in the same band.

	"Brute creatures hit hard and have a lot of hit points. Their damage output can't be ignored, so player characters often focus on taking down brutes instead of other creatures who have fewer hit points or are weaker in melee. Brutes need to get up close to perform their most devastating attacks, so they work best on smaller battlefields.

	"Soldier creatures defend their allies by drawing the player characters' attacks. They make excellent protectors for ambushers, artillery creatures, controllers, leaders, and support creatures. Soldiers don't need to stay very close to the creatures they protect—and it's better if they don't. A soldier who breaks away from their charge can lock down a threat far from the rest of the fight.": "士兵生物通过吸引玩家角色的攻击来保护他们的盟友。他们是伏击者、炮兵生物、控制者、领袖和支援生物的绝佳保护者。士兵不需要离他们保护的生物太近——最好是不要。一个远离他们任务目标的士兵可以限制远离战斗其他地方的威胁。",
	"During combat, soldiers engage characters who are strong in melee. A soldier battles as many foes as they can reach so their allies can freely move. If more than one soldier is in a battle, they typically split up, each fighting  different character.": "在战斗中，士兵会与擅长近战的角色展开战斗。士兵会与他们能够接触到的敌人战斗，以便让他们的盟友可以自由移动。如果有多名士兵参与战斗，他们通常会分开行动，每个人与不同的角色战斗。",

They focus on the character threatening them most, but also position themselves to target as many foes as possible with their area-of-effect features.": "独行生物利用他们的一切移动优势，在他们的回合中钻地、攀爬、飞行、游泳或传送，以应对战场上的局势。它们会集中攻击威胁最大的角色，同时也会调整位置，以便利用其范围效果攻击尽可能多的敌人。",
	"Building combat encounters using the game's core rules is complex, time-consuming, and doesn't work for the play style of many groups. The core rules state that most adventuring parties can handle about six to eight mediumdifficulty encounters per adventuring day. This is good advice for classic dungeon crawls, but in adventures that fit more into the heroic fantasy genre, player characters rarely face more than three or four encounters before settling down for a long rest. When GMs use the core guidelines for such adventures, heroes often aren't pushed to satisfying limits—especially at higher levels where their daily resources are vast.": "使用游戏的核心规则构建战斗遭遇是复杂、耗时的，而且并不适合许多团队的游戏风格。核心规则规定，大多数冒险队伍可以在冒险日内处理大约六到八个中等难度的遭遇。这对于经典的地牢探险是个不错的建议，但在更适合英雄奇幻风格的冒险中，玩家角色很少在安顿下来休息之前面对三到四个遭遇。当GM们在这类冒险中使用核心指南时，英雄们通常不会被推到令人满意的极限——尤其是在高等级时，他们的每日资源是巨大的。",
	"The guidance in this section presents a more flexible way of planning a challenging (but survivable) adventuring day. It replaces the advice in the core rules and allows you to better dial in the challenge of an encounter with less preparation time.": "这一部分的指导提出了一种更灵活的方式来规划一个具有挑战性（但可应对的）冒险日程。它取代了核心规则中的建议，让你能更好地调整遭遇的挑战程度，减少准备时间。",
	"An adventuring day is the time between the end of one long rest to the end of the next. How many combat encounters should adventurers face between those long rests?

	"Though this section uses familiar language regarding encounter difficulty, the meanings of these terms don't align perfectly with the core rules. For instance, for parties of 5th level and beyond, the core rules might call an encounter \"hard,\" but under our guidelines the encounter is standard or even easy. And some \"deadly\" encounters in the core rules are merely hard encounters under our guidelines. These differences account for fewer encounters in a day.": "尽管本节使用了关于遭遇难度的熟悉语言，但这些术语的含义并不完全符合核心规则。例如，对于5级及以上的队伍，核心规则可能会将一个遭遇称为“困难”，但根据我们的指南，这个遭遇是标准的甚至是容易的。而一些核心规则中的“致命”遭遇在我们的指南下仅仅是困难的遭遇。这些差异导致了一天中遭遇数量的减少。",

The characters are guaranteed to survive the fight and won't spend many resources. These encounters can be fun to occasionally throw into your game, but for many groups, the novelty disappears quickly. Too many trivial encounters can feel like a waste of time.": "微不足道的遭遇对角色来说几乎没有任何挑战——就像一群20级英雄对抗一些爬行的手和哥布林。角色们肯定会在战斗中幸存下来，并且不会消耗太多资源。偶尔在游戏中抛入这些遭遇可能会很有趣，但对许多团队来说，新奇感很快就会消失。太多微不足道的遭遇会让人觉得浪费时间。",
	"A trivial encounter is worth 0 daily encounter points.": "一个琐碎的遭遇值得 0 日常遭遇点。",

Easy encounters are great for adventures that don't give the characters much time to rest or for times when you want the heroes to feel like superheroes.": "除非角色们已经耗尽了许多资源和生命值，简单的遭遇不会威胁到他们的生命。简单的遭遇非常适合那些冒险中没有太多休息时间的情况，或者当你想让英雄们感觉像超级英雄时。",
	"An easy encounter is worth 1 daily encounter point.": "一次简单的遭遇值得1点每日遭遇点数。",
	"Standard encounters are the most common for many adventuring groups. These battles deplete significant resources and hit points. While character death is uncommon in standard encounters, it isn't impossible, especially if a player makes a poor tactical choice or just finds the dice are against them.": "标准遭遇对许多冒险团队来说是最常见的。这些战斗会消耗大量资源和生命值。虽然在标准遭遇中角色死亡并不常见，但并非不可能，特别是如果玩家做出了糟糕的战术选择，或者发现骰子对他们不利。",
	"A standard encounter is worth 2 daily encounter points.": "一个标准遭遇值得 2 个每日遭遇点。",

Hard encounters are winnable, but the characters need all their resources, wits, and luck to survive.": "困难的遭遇通常是与首领及其手下的高潮对抗，或者任何可能危及角色生命的情况。困难的遭遇是可以取胜的，但角色需要动用所有资源、智慧和运气才能幸存。",
	"A hard encounter is worth 4 daily encounter points.": "一次困难的遭遇值得 4 点每日遭遇点数。",
	"Extreme encounters are ones where the characters will likely not survive if they try to fight to the bitter end. Such encounters rarely or never appear in most campaigns—though if the characters are level 17 or higher, they can typically survive (or come back to life after) such encounters.": "极端遭遇是指角色如果试图战斗到最后很可能无法生存下来的情况。这种遭遇在大多数冒险中很少或几乎不会出现——尽管如果角色达到17级或更高级，他们通常可以在这种遭遇中生存下来（或在之后复活）。",
	"An extreme encounter is worth 8 daily encounter points.": "一次极端遭遇值得 8 点每日遭遇点数。",
	"The characters might avoid combat encounters through stealth, clever negotiation, luck, or other unforeseen circumstances. You have two options when this happens. First is to let the heroes have the extra resources going into the next battle—clever thinking should be rewarded! But if your group likes to fight, you can always add another combat encounter to the adventuring day (if it fits within your daily encounter points budget).": "角色们可以通过潜行、巧妙的谈判、运气或其他意想不到的情况来避免战斗。当这种情况发生时，你有两个选择。第一种是让英雄们在下一场战斗中拥有额外的资源——聪明的想法应该得到奖励！但如果你的团队喜欢战斗，你也可以在冒险日中增加另一个战斗遭遇（如果符合你每日遭遇点数预算的话）。",
	"Once you choose the desired difficulty of your encounter, you can determine its CR budget. To do so, you'll need to know the average character level of the party (rounding down).": "一旦您选择了所需的遭遇难度，您可以确定其CR预算。为此，您需要知道小组的平均角色等级（向下取整）。",
	"Using the Encounter CR per Character table, find the row that lists your party's average character level, then find the column that lists your desired encounter difficulty.

	"For example, if you wanted to build a hard encounter for a group of four 5th-level characters, you would multiply 2½ (from the Encounter CR per Character table) by 4 (the number of characters) to get a total CR budget of 10.": "例如，如果你想为一组四名5级角色设计一个困难的战斗，你可以将2½（从每个角色的遭遇CR表中获得）乘以4（角色数量），得到一个总CR预算为10。",
	"For the purpose of encounter building, if the player characters adventure with one or more companions or retainers, consider them player characters but subtract 2 from their actual level. However, if a companion's caregiver is a beastheart, don't count the companion as an extra character—the beastheart and companion together have the equivalent power of one full character.": "为了进行遭遇构建，如果玩家角色与一个或多个同伴或随从一起冒险，请将它们视为玩家角色，但从它们的实际等级中减去2。然而，如果同伴的照顾者是一个兽心术士，不要将同伴视为额外角色——兽心术士和同伴一起具有一个完整角色的等效力量。",
	"Some creatures who fit into your CR budget are too much for the characters to handle. Those monsters deal a lot of damage and create effects that are difficult to overcome for characters under a certain level. That's why the Encounter CR per Character table provides a challenge rating cap for each average character level.

After the carnage, they linger for weeks at a time, slowly devouring the dead as they wait for the fresh bodies to become maggot-riddled corpses.": "{@b {@i Harbingers of Death.}} 恰如其名，一群死鹰被称为预兆。它们具有一种不可思议的即将发生血腥事件的直觉，预兆经常在被围困的定居点或未来的战场上空盘旋数日，等待即将到来的盛宴。在屠杀结束后，它们会停留数周的时间，慢慢地吞食尸体，等待新鲜的尸体变成蛆虫爬满的尸体。",
	"{@b {@i Meal Prep.}} Though deathhawks prefer decomposing flesh, they hunt live prey if no corpses are available—or if they are preparing for their young to hatch. While one deathhawk guards the nest, their mate hunts, accumulating a grisly collection of flesh that has plenty of time to rot before the scaly gray chicks are born.": "{@b {@i Meal Prep.}} 尽管死亡鹰更喜欢腐烂的肉，但如果没有尸体可用，或者他们正在准备孵化幼崽，他们会猎取活猎。当一只死亡鹰守护巢穴时，它们的伴侣会出去狩猎，积累一堆可怕的肉，这些肉有足够的时间在鳞灰色的幼鸟出生之前腐烂。",
	"{@b {@i Undead Hunters.}} Deathhawks can prove useful to mortals—particularly those who hunt undead—for these birds are not only terrifyingly intelligent, but eager to eat the flesh of the living dead. Organizations devoted to resisting the scourge of unnatural forces raise deathhawks from chicks and train them to hunt.": "{@b {@i Undead Hunters.}}死亡鹰对凡人来说可能非常有用，特别是那些猎杀不死生物的人，因为这些鸟不仅极具智慧，而且渴望吃活死人的肉。致力于抵抗不自然力量的组织会从幼鸟开始培养死亡鹰，并训练它们进行狩猎。",
	"Lightning eels have mottled dark-gray skin threaded with trails of silvery blue. They continue growing throughout their lifetime, simply adding vertebrae to their long, sinuous bodies. A lightning eel might grow to 2 feet long in the first year of their life, but ancient lightning eels have been rumored to live for half a century and grow up to 30 feet long—a small sea serpent!": "闪电鳗鱼有斑驳的深灰色皮肤，上面布满银蓝色的纹路。它们终身不断生长，只是在它们修长的身体上增加脊椎。一条闪电鳗鱼可能在它们一生中的第一年长到2英尺长，但据传说，古老的闪电鳗鱼可以活上半个世纪，长到30英尺长——一个小海蛇！",
	"Lightning eels live in groups of ten to twenty individuals of various sizes, known as a flash. They can hunt alone or as a group to take down entire shoals of fish—or larger, more dangerous prey. The flash migrates between bodies of fresh and salt water, following the patterns of storms and hurricanes. The sight of a flash circling just beneath the surface is a sure sign of an impending storm.": "闪电鳗鱼生活在由十到二十只不同大小个体组成的群体中，被称为一道闪电。它们可以独自狩猎，也可以作为一个团队来攻击整群鱼或更大、更危险的猎物。这道闪电会在淡水和盐水之间迁徙，跟随风暴和飓风的路径。当一道闪电在水面下盘旋时，这是即将来临的暴风雨的明确迹象。",
	"These winged white foxes live in frigid polar regions and high snow-covered plateaus. During the winter, a snowfox's beautiful coat and plumage are primarily white with a scattering of dark-gray speckles. In warmer months, their coat takes on more brown, gray, and black, helping them blend in with the shifting terrain. Snowfoxes tend to live in mated pairs (for life or for a season) and raise a litter of two to four kits at a time.": "这些有翅膀的白狐狸生活在寒冷的极地地区和高海拔积雪覆盖的高原上。在冬季，雪狐美丽的外套和羽毛主要是白色的，带有一些深灰色的斑点。在较暖和的月份，它们的外套变成更多的棕色、灰色和黑色，帮助它们融入不断变化的地形中。雪狐倾向于成对生活（终身或一个季节）并一次抚养两到四只幼崽。",
	"A droning, chirping, or clicking swarm of insectoids is a surprisingly daunting sight. Though they be but tiny, they are numerous and united in pursuit of their collective goal.": "一群嗡嗡、叫啾或者点击的昆虫族群是一个令人意外地令人生畏的景象。虽然它们个头很小，但它们数量众多，团结一致地追求着它们的共同目标。",

Padded feet, sensitive whiskers, and long tails help them move nimbly and silently.": "各种形状和大小的猫科动物在荒野中自由漫游，偶尔也会出现在城市的小巷里。猫类通常是独自狩猎者，它们会悄无声息地潜行捕捉猎物，然后一跃而下将其击倒。软软的脚掌、敏感的胡须和长长的尾巴帮助它们灵活、静悄悄地移动。",
	"{@b {@i Feline Variation.}} Many different cats live in woodlands, jungles, savannahs, and mountains. Big cats, like lions, cougars, and jaguars, use their strength to quell larger prey. Smaller felines, like ocelots, servals, margays, and even housecats, rely on their agility and reflexes to ambush their quarry.": "{@b {@i Feline Variation.}} 许多不同种类的猫生活在森林、丛林、草原和山区。像狮子、美洲狮和美洲虎这样的大猫利用他们的力量来制服更大的猎物。较小的猫科动物，如豹猫、猞猁、豹猫，甚至家猫，依靠他们的敏捷和反射能力来伏击猎物。",

	"While Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks are typically limited to influencing trained or domesticated animals, you can lift this restriction to allow your characters to attempt to influence wild animals, such as a hungry panther who sees the party as dinner.

Each found a new territory and claimed the role of divine protector over that place, its inhabitants, and its treasures.": "据说女王愤怒的情绪传达到了众神。当她尖叫时，附近的火山喷发了，喷出玄武岩和奇美拉覆盖了整片土地。带着烈焰的力量，奇美拉们击败了对立的军队并四散逃离。每个奇美拉找到了一个新的领土，并宣称自己是那个地方、其居民和财宝的神圣守护者。",
	"{@b {@i Fiercely Faithful.}} When a chimera acts as a guardian, almost nothing can shake that loyalty. They are viciously territorial over objects, creatures, and founts of magic they defend.

Such chimeras happily serve evil mortals.": "{@b {@i Corrupted Loyalty.}} 获得螭首信任的凡人可以诱使并训练这个怪兽，激发它三种本性中最坏的一面：龙的贪婪、狮子的骄傲和山羊的固执。这样的螭首会愉快地为邪恶的凡人效劳。",
	"{@b {@i Tactical Warriors.}} Chimeras have many ways to keep themselves and their charges from being cornered. The lion head snaps up enemies in massive jaws and hurls them away, the ram head pummels them to the ground, and the dragon head bathes them in fire. The sound of the three heads crying together can shake even the most stalwart warriors.": "{@b {@i Tactical Warriors.}} 奇美拉有许多方法来保护自己和它们的主人不被困住。狮子头用巨大的下颚抓住敌人并将他们抛开，公羊头将他们猛击到地面，而龙头则用火焰浇灌他们。三个头一起哭叫的声音甚至可以震撼最坚定的战士。",
	"{@b {@i One Being, Three Heads.}} Unlike many other multiheaded creatures, a chimera has a single mind.

	"When a demon's soul count drops to 0, they fall into a state known as lethe—a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance.

	"Soul devouring makes demons deadly opponents. To give characters a better chance of living through their encounter with a demon, you can reduce the DC of the saving throw—or you can remove the saving throw entirely, and only allow a demon to devour a soul when a creature dies within 60 feet of them through other means. On the other hand, you might like to scale up the deadliness with more powerful demons!

	"Each time a demon consumes a soul, there's a chance they may evolve into a more powerful demon. Though Category 1 demons typically become Category 2 demons after consuming just one soul, there's no known pattern to how more powerful demons evolve. For example, some Category 2 demons evolve to Category 3 after consuming just one soul, while others must devour thousands before earning a promotion. This evolution can be instant, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether these evolutions are aided by consuming souls that are especially corrupt or heroic.": "每当一个恶魔吞噬一个灵魂时，它们有机会进化成更强大的恶魔。尽管1级恶魔通常在吞噬一个灵魂后就会进化成2级恶魔，但更强大的恶魔如何进化并没有已知的模式。例如，一些2级恶魔吞噬一个灵魂后就进化成3级，而另一些则必须吞噬成千上万个灵魂才能晋升。这种进化可能是瞬间发生的，也可能需要数年时间。这种不一致性导致了学术界对于所有灵魂是否平等，或者这些进化是否受到吞噬特别腐败或英勇灵魂的帮助的激烈辩论。",

	"Beings with glowing eyes and tendriled maws, ruinants breathe with a sickening wheeze and have bodies covered in inflamed scars. These Category 2 demons aim to kill healers first, knowing that such tactics make the rest of their prey fall faster.

	"The tormenauk resembles a hulking ape with a dozen or more extra mouths randomly distributed around their body. Though their brute force is formidable enough, this Category 3 demon also inflicts raw psychic pain by screaming from their mouths in different voices—often using the agonized voices of souls the tormenauk has devoured.": "托门诺克 (Tormenauk) 看起来像一个庞大的猿猴，身上分布着十几个或更多额外的嘴巴。尽管它们的蛮力已经足够强大，但这种三级恶魔还通过用不同的声音从它们的嘴巴中尖叫来施加原始的心灵痛苦——通常使用的是托门诺克吞食过的灵魂的痛苦声音。",

	"In the lower plane of Hell, devils of the Seven Cities vie unceasingly against each other for power and control—a conflict fought foremostly through cunning and schemes.

At the GM's discretion, the devil could still offer a contract—one that asks much of the summoner.": "如果生物在召唤检定中失败了5点或更多，那么恶魔将像“成功”部分中描述的那样被召唤出来，但这个恶魔并不受到召唤者的契约束缚，可以随心所欲地行动。在GM的裁量下，恶魔仍然可以提供一份合同——这份合同会要求召唤者付出很多代价。",
	"If a creature fails the summon check by 10 or more, they suffer the consequences of failing by 5 or more, and an additional planar entity—such as a such as a demon, an Elemental, or a Celestial—is also summoned. This additional entity is hostile toward the summoner.": "如果一个生物在召唤检定中失败了10点或更多，他们会遭受失败5点或更多的后果，并且会召唤出一个额外的位面实体，比如一个恶魔、一个元素生物或一个天界生物。这个额外的实体对召唤者是敌对的。",
	"In the end we got Zalkith's devil-lieutenant to switch sides. We were lucky; Chance is a devilkin. She did all the talking. After the fight, the lieutenant wanted to broker some agreement, but we're not stupid. First rule of dealing with devils—don't sign anything.": "最后我们说服了扎尔基斯的恶魔副官改变立场。我们很幸运；Chance是一个恶魔血脉。她全程都在谈判。战斗结束后，副官想要达成某种协议，但我们并不傻。和恶魔打交道的第一条规则就是——不要签任何东西。",
	"The tiny cousins of majestic true dragons, dragonets are much less powerful—and prideful—than their larger kin. Though true dragons are essentially immortal, dragonets are omnivores who only live for about a century and need food to survive.": "龙的微小表亲，龙崽（dragonets）比起宏伟的真龙要弱小得多，也没有那么自负。虽然真龙基本上是不朽的，龙崽是杂食动物，只能活上大约一个世纪，需要食物来维持生存。",
	"Each dragonet has a traditional Draconic name, but they also choose a nickname reserved for clutchmates, close friends, and their mate or mates (many dragonets mate for life with one or more partners). An adventurer who befriends a dragonet might even find the dragonet bestows a nickname on their new friend. The Dragonet Names table presents examples of dragonet names and nicknames.": "每只幼龙都有一个传统的龙语名字，但他们也会选择一个昵称，专门留给同窝的伙伴、亲密朋友和他们的伴侣（许多幼龙一生中会与一个或多个伴侣结成伴侣关系）。一个冒险者如果和一个幼龙成为朋友，甚至可能会被幼龙赐予一个昵称。《幼龙名字》表格展示了幼龙名字和昵称的例子。",
	"Although dragonets rarely practice spellcraft themselves, they are attuned to arcane forces. These clever creatures have an innate understanding of spells and supernatural effects, as well as a keen sense for telling truth from fiction. Dragonets eschew deception and lies among friends, and they have little compunction about calling out untrue statements with varying levels of tact, though they understand well the need for lying to enemies.": "虽然幼龙们很少自己练习咒术，但它们对奥术力量有着特殊的感应。这些聪明的生物天生就对咒语和超自然效应有着理解，同时也有着敏锐的辨别真假的能力。幼龙们在朋友之间避免欺骗和谎言，他们对于揭露不实陈述有着不同程度的直率，尽管他们也很清楚在对待敌人时有时需要撒谎。",
	"{@b {@i Family Bonds.}} True dragons recognize dragonets as kin, and most will protect a dragonet in danger—or at least try to avoid killing any dragonet caught up in their conflicts.

	"Particularly adventurous dragonets are eager to accompany spellcasters as their companions or familiars. Dragonets tend to be curious, gregarious, and fiercely loyal to their chosen companions. Those who hope to befriend a dragonet should take note that their preferred foods are fresh fruit and fish (raw, seared, or smoked)—though dragonets introduced to humanoid delicacies also become particularly fond of spiced or sweetened nuts.": "特别是那些冒险心切的幼龙们渴望成为咒术师的同伴或使者。幼龙们往往好奇、爱交际，并对他们选择的伙伴忠心耿耿。那些希望交友的幼龙的人应该注意，它们喜欢的食物是新鲜水果和鱼（生的、煎的或熏的）—尽管被介绍给人类美食的幼龙也会特别喜欢香辣或甜味的坚果。",
	"{@b {@i Familiar.}} The dragonet can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with their willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the dragonet senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. In addition, when the dragonet uses their Truesight action, their companion also has truesight while in physical contact with the dragonet. Either creature can end the bond at any time.": "{@b {@i Familiar.}} 龙崽可以作为另一个生物的使魔，与愿意的伙伴形成一种心灵感应的联系。当两者绑定时，只要它们相距不超过1英里，伙伴就可以感知到龙崽的感知。此外，当龙崽使用他们的真视行动时，只要与龙崽保持身体接触，他们的伙伴也会获得真视。任何一方都可以随时结束这种联系。",

This gloom dragon's venerable age is surpassed only by the fear they command. Also known as the Sun Eater and the Silent Decay, Qazyldrath features heavily in the oral tradition of draconic ancestries; they're said to be one of the progenitors of lesser dragons and the one responsible for the viciousness of dragonkind.": "卡兹拉斯 ({@link KAZZ-ill-drath|https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Qazyldrath.html}) 是一个古老的噩梦生物，一位操纵酸液和阴影的操纵者，一个自从龙翼首次吞噬太阳之光以来就一直困扰着凡人心灵的怪物。这位阴暗龙的崇高年龄仅被他们所掌控的恐惧所超越。卡兹拉斯被称为太阳吞噬者和寂静腐蚀者，在龙族祖先的口头传统中占据重要地位；据说他们是次级龙的祖先之一，也是龙族凶残本性的根源。",

	"Dragons seek lairs with lofty ceilings (or none at all) so they can use one of their greatest defenses: flight.

	"Mortal monarchs would do well to take heed when a force of blood's scarlet lance approaches. These elementals keenly understand mortals and never treat with them for idle purpose.": "凡人君主们最好警惕当一支血色长矛的力量接近时。这些元素灵敏地了解凡人，从不与他们无谓交谈。",
	"A protective earth elemental, a force of earth resembles a nine-foot-tall great ape formed of rough stone. They act as guardians and historians to their ishkrar, working tirelessly to thwart ills from befalling the group. These elementals are sometimes called earthen bulwarks.": "一个保护性的地球元素，一股地之力，形似一个由粗石头组成的九英尺高的大猩猩。他们充当着守护者和历史学家的角色，不知疲倦地努力阻止不幸降临在他们的伊什克拉(`ishkrar`)团体上。这些元素有时被称为土之壁垒。",
	"A force of iron, also called an iron stalwart, appears as a four-armed centaur made of malleable metal with a head shaped like an empty knight's helm. Most are staunch, loyal, and uncompromising. Some forces of iron even achieve fame by facing down wickedness where they find it—but others become wickedness, using their strength to vanquish anything that even mildly displeases them.": "一股铁之力，也被称为铁之坚韧，呈现为一个由可塑金属制成的四臂半人马，头部呈空的骑士头盔形状。大多数都坚定、忠诚且不妥协。一些铁之力甚至因在发现邪恶时挺身而出而闻名——但也有些变得邪恶，利用他们的力量消灭任何使他们稍微不悦的事物。",
	"An oracle of storms, or tempest augur, seeks the power and wisdom of the thundering clouds. While some oracles form family groups, many choose solitary lives atop lonely peaks, searching for answers in the billowing clouds. Their divinatory magics display the world's stories in the sky, etched in lightning and cloudy silhouettes.": "一位风暴先知，或者风暴占卜者，寻求雷鸣云霄中的力量和智慧。虽然一些先知会组成家族团体，但许多人选择独自生活在孤峰之巅，寻找蓬勃发展的云中答案。他们的占卜魔法将世界的故事展现在天空中，刻在闪电和云朵的轮廓中。",

	"The principle of growth takes the form of a massive centipede made of vegetation. Often called verdant primevals, these caretakers of the natural cycle of life (and death) fight those they see as upsetting that cycle. Principles of growth seek not only to destroy undead and those who create them, but to sabotage divine servitors who casually peddle resurrection magic.": "生长之原则化身为一只由植被构成的巨大蜈蚣。通常被称为葱郁原初者，这些自然生命周期的守护者（和死亡）会与那些扰乱这一周期的存在进行战斗。生长之原则不仅寻求摧毁不死生物及其创造者，还试图破坏轻率使用复活魔法的神圣仆从。",
	"On their home planes, elemental sparks are living motes of floating air, earth, fire, and water. When one of these elemental minions travels to another world, they take the form of an animal native to that plane. In the Mundane World, air sparks appear as winged serpents, earth sparks appear as rhinoceroses, fire sparks appear as bears, and water sparks take on the appearance of octopuses.": "在它们的本源位面上，元素火花是漂浮的空气、土地、火焰和水的微粒。当这些元素仆从之一前往另一个世界时，它们会呈现出该位面本地动物的形态。在平凡世界中，空气火花会呈现为有翅膀的蛇(`air sparks`), 土地火花会呈现为犀牛(`earth sparks`), 火焰火花会呈现为熊(`fire sparks`), 而水火花则会呈现为章鱼(`water sparks`)。",

Their angelic appearance and restorative abilities instantly earn the respect of many mortals, which the elementals use to their advantage in negotiations. Evil nexuses masquerade as celestials to trick religious humanoids into doing their bidding.": "阳光（Sunlight）节点经常作为伊斯克拉（ishkrar）的使者。它们天使般的外表和恢复能力立即赢得了许多凡人的尊重，元素生物们利用这一点在谈判中占据优势。邪恶节点伪装成天神，欺骗宗教人形生物为其服务。",

	"{@b {@i Protected Realm.}} Atæshia spends most of her time atop Tempest, a great mountain with an upper half hidden in an enormous storm. Powerful elementals at the peak manifest lightning and hail the size of apples to hide the Ash Queen's realm. Any who brave the treacherous climb find that the center of the perpetual squall contains a sunny mountain paradise. Here, elementals shape the land with placid pools, burning lava geysers, icy sculptures, lush gardens, and anything else they wish to manifest. The only requirement to stay in Tempest is to believe in the Ash Queen's cause and follow her orders whenever you are called upon. Even those who aren't elementals are welcome to stay provided they observe Atæshia's rules.": "{@b {@i Protected Realm.}} 阿泰西娅（Atæshia）大部分时间都在位于一座名为暴风（Tempest）的巨大山峰之巅度过，这座山的上半部被一个巨大的风暴所掩盖。山峰上强大的元素在顶峰上显现出闪电和苹果大小的冰雹，以掩盖灰烬女王（Ash Queen）的领域。任何冒险攀登的人都会发现这个永恒风暴的中心是一个阳光普照的山间乐园。在这里，元素塑造着大地，有宁静的水池、喷发的熔岩间歇泉、冰雕、郁郁葱葱的花园，以及他们希望显现的任何事物。留在暴风的唯一要求是相信灰烬女王的事业，并在被召唤时遵循她的命令。即使不是元素的人也可以留下，只要他们遵守阿泰西娅的规则。",

	"The elementals presented in this section favor magic items that let them summon Elemental companions, like the {@item censer of controlling air elementals} or {@item elemental gem}. These items conjure allies who can be immediately enhanced by the summoner, increasing the item's value and effect to the elementals who use them. Some elementals might also use items that create a damaging area of effect if their allies are immune to the damage's type. For instance, a force of iron who forms an ishkrar with several cruxes of fire and fire sparks can use a {@item necklace of fireballs} or the Shooting Stars effect of a {@item ring of shooting stars} without fear of harming their allies.": "本节中介绍的元素生物偏好能让它们召唤元素伙伴的魔法物品，比如{@item censer of controlling air elementals}或{@item elemental gem}。这些物品会召唤盟友，召唤者可以立即增强这些盟友，提高物品的价值和效果，对使用它们的元素生物有帮助。一些元素生物可能还会使用能够制造伤害范围的物品，如果它们的盟友对这种伤害类型免疫的话。例如，一支铁之力量与几个火之十字架和火花结合形成一个伊斯克拉，就可以使用{@item necklace of fireballs}或{@item ring of shooting stars}的流星射击效果，而不必担心伤害到它们的盟友。",
	"Elementals have damage and condition immunities that allow them to lair in environments most mortals would find deadly. For instance, a crux of frost, a force of earth, and a force of iron could lair together in an underground cavern filled with toxic mold since they're all immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.": "元素生物具有伤害和状态免疫力，使它们能够在大多数凡人认为致命的环境中安家落户。例如，一团霜之核，一团土之力，和一团铁之力可以一起在一个充满有毒霉菌的地下洞穴中安家，因为它们都对毒素伤害和中毒状态免疫。",

	"Quintessence's chronographic index of 1.86 qualifies it as a Lower World, only slightly higher energy than Manifold One. Because the two manifolds constructively interfere, the denizens of Quintessence often manifest on Manifold One, and many consider it their home.

	"Each elemental has a bonus action called a convocation that makes them strongest when working with other creatures of the Elemental type. This includes some not found in this section of the book, like the {@creature fossil cryptic|FleeMortals} in the \"Cave\" environment of chapter 2.

That way, when initiative is rolled, you'll already know how each elemental can aid their allies.": "每个元素生物都有一个名为召集（convocation）的奖励动作，当它们与其他元素生物合作时会变得更强大。这包括一些在本书的这一部分中找不到的元素生物，比如第2章“洞穴”环境中的{@creature fossil cryptic|FleeMortals}。当你构建与元素生物有关的遭遇时，要特别注意它们的奖励动作选项。这样，当投掷先攻骰时，你就已经知道每个元素生物如何帮助他们的盟友了。",
	"Many elementals can use only their convocation once or twice per day. It's best to use these options at the start of an encounter instead of waiting for later rounds of combat, since an elemental could perish before they get the chance to do their cool thing.": "许多元素生物每天只能使用他们的召唤术一两次。最好在遭遇开始时使用这些选项，而不是等到战斗的后几轮，因为元素生物可能在有机会展示自己的厉害之前就会死亡。",
	"You can create unique elementals by swapping one convocation for another. For instance, you could create an essence of storms who is infused with air and earth properties by trading the creature's Convocation of Air for the force of earth's Convocation of Earth. You could even rename the creature the essence of sandstorms.": "您可以通过交换一个召唤术来创造独特的元素生物。例如，您可以通过将生物的风之召唤换成地之召唤，创造一个融合了空气和土地属性的风暴精华。您甚至可以将这个生物命名为沙尘风暴精华。",
	"When you swap the convocations of two elementals, pay close attention to each creature's challenge rating.

The earth elemental companion is a more traditional elemental who might be summoned by a spellcaster to serve as a guardian; they therefore work better as a companion.": "这本书介绍了两个完全有智慧的基本随从，就像本节中的大多数其他元素生物一样。土元素随从是一个更传统的元素，可能会被一个咒术师召唤来充当守护者；因此，他们更适合作为伙伴。",

	"Though giants sometimes live near humanoid settlements, the latter often pass their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few \"smallfolk\" structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.": "尽管巨人有时会住在人类聚居地附近，但后者通常会在整个生命中幸福地不知道附近山脉顶部生活着的巨人部落。这是最好的，因为即使是少数受到足够激励的巨人，也很少有“小人类”建筑能幸存下来。",
	"{@b {@i Adaptable and Elemental.}} Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn't simply live on a mountain—they're part of the mountain, and it's part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, \"Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?\"": "{@b {@i Adaptable and Elemental.}} 巨人在外貌上与他们所居住的领土相似。一群霜巨人不仅仅生活在山上，他们是山的一部分，而山也是他们的一部分。火巨人散发着像喷发火山一样的热量。学者们长期以来一直在辩论这个问题：“环境塑造了巨人，还是巨人塑造了他们的环境？”",
	"{@b {@i Distant Cousins.}} Humanoid scholars usually assume all giants are related, though giants don't view their kin as brethren by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants tend to detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they're willing to be in the vanguard. Though giants rarely go to war with one another, their battles can change the very geography of a continent, causing earthquakes, storms, and volcanic eruptions.": "{@b {@i Distant Cousins.}} 人形学者通常假设所有巨人都有关联，尽管巨人并不默认视他们的同类为兄弟。当不同的巨人社区互动时，结果很大程度上取决于参与其中的个体以及他们文化之间的关系。例如，石巨人很少与丘陵巨人相处融洽，因为丘陵巨人倾向于厌恶石头工艺。与此同时，霜巨人乐意招募丘陵巨人加入掠夺队伍，只要他们愿意担任先锋。尽管巨人很少相互交战，但他们的战斗可能改变一个大陆的地理格局，引发地震、风暴和火山喷发。",
	"Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma alike, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake. Though their reputation is one of violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding.": "来自酷热的沙漠和滚烫岩浆深洞的火巨人体现了他们名字的激情和无情。尽管他们以暴力的增长和扩张而闻名，但他们鲜为人知的一面是深具精神意义，受内省和理解的指引。",
	"{@b {@i Martial Artists.}} Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat up to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing straps to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into the perfect weapons of war.": "{@b {@i Martial Artists.}} 火巨人很少穿盔甲，因为他们在战斗时身体会升温到极端温度，导致皮带融化和金属变形。他们反而将自己的身体磨练成完美的战争武器。",
	"Once a lieutenant of the Sunlight Legion, Aastrika fought and clawed through the ranks, proving herself in battle after battle. However, she suspected many above her felt threatened by her meteoric rise, and her suspicions were confirmed when her unit was dispatched deep into the desert. There, Aastrika discovered signs of blue dragon territory and realized her superiors had ordered her into a trap.": "曾是阳光军团的一名中尉，阿斯特里卡在一次又一次的战斗中奋勇争先，证明了自己的实力。然而，她怀疑许多高层对她的迅速崛起感到威胁，当她的部队被派往沙漠深处时，她的怀疑得到了证实。在那里，阿斯特里卡发现了蓝龙的领地迹象，意识到她的上级命令其走入了陷阱。",
	"On sharing her discovery with her unit, they decided together to desert the legion. Rather than face the dragon, Aastrika and her troops pursued spiritual enlightenment. They roamed the highest sunlit mountain peaks and deepest volcanic caverns in search of understanding. In one of these magma tunnels, Aastrika crawled deep into a volcanic crater and remained for hours. When she returned, she spoke of her body discorporating into fire and of newly unearthed wisdom, and in this moment, her unit became her first spiritual followers.": "在与她的小队分享了她的发现后，他们决定一起背弃军团。与其面对那条龙，Aastrika 和她的部队选择追求精神启蒙。他们漫游于最高的阳光照耀的山峰和最深的火山洞穴，寻找理解。在其中一个岩浆隧道中，Aastrika 深入火山口并在那里待了几个小时。当她返回时，她讲述了自己的身体融入火焰和新发现的智慧，在这一刻，她的小队成为了她的第一批精神追随者。",
	"Returning to the Sunlight Legion, Aastrika used her newfound prowess and understanding to depose the leadership that sent her to her death. She then claimed her rightful place as warlord and spiritual leader in equal parts, preaching the importance of balance in both.": "回到阳光军团，阿斯特里卡(Aastrika)利用她新获得的能力和理解力废黜了那些送她赴死的领导人。然后，她正当地成为了战争领袖和精神领袖，一边强调平衡的重要性。",
	"Born of soaring peaks in frigid mountains, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, which they carry like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory.": "在寒冷的山脉中诞生于陡峭的山峰之间，霜巨人善于驾驭环境，统治山脉，并建造坚不可摧的冰堡。当霜巨人行军时，头顶上方会升起暴风雪，他们将其视为战旗。对霜巨人来说，战斗是一种生活方式、同伴情谊和荣耀。",
	"{@b {@i Issenblau.}} Where frost giants make their home, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their tongue, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.": "{@b {@i Issenblau.}} 在霜巨人的家园，一种独特形式的冰会长出开花的晶莹结构。霜巨人会收割这种冰，他们的语言中称之为伊森布劳（Issenblau），并将其制成像钢一样坚硬锋利的武器，可以在任何环境中使用而不会融化。",
	"Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Though most hill giants want to be left in peace, if pressed, one can demolish a small village in minutes.": "在所有的巨人文化中，丘陵巨人最有可能与人形生物互动。丘陵巨人和小人族都喜欢生活在起伏肥沃的田野上，并且都欣赏大自然的美丽。然而，如果邪恶的丘陵巨人联合起来，将土地据为己有，或者小人族因为害怕巨人而试图驱赶他们这些更大的邻居，这些共同点很快就会被遗忘。虽然大多数丘陵巨人希望被放置在和平中，但如果被逼迫，他们可以在几分钟内摧毁一个小村庄。",
	"{@b {@i Strength and Hierarchy.}} Many evil hill giants respect strength above all. They seek to dominate creatures they perceive as weak, such as ogres and goblins, while bending the knee to creatures stronger than themselves. Other hill giants instead become wardens of their smaller neighbors, driving off bandits and other threats.": "{@b {@i Strength and Hierarchy.}} 许多邪恶的丘陵巨人尊重力量胜过一切。他们试图统治他们认为弱小的生物，比如食人魔和哥布林，同时向比自己更强大的生物屈膝。其他一些丘陵巨人则成为他们较小邻居的守护者，驱赶土匪和其他威胁。",
	"{@b {@i Easily Distracted.}} Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In times of battle, such distractions can draw the hill giant's ire, making them switch from one target to another.": "{@b {@i Easily Distracted.}} 大多数山岭巨人在安静的时光中度过，突如其来的耀眼景象和大声噪音会吸引他们的注意。在战斗时，这样的干扰会引起山岭巨人的愤怒，使他们从一个目标转向另一个目标。",
	"Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity.": "石巨人着迷于创造的行为，他们在古老的洞穴中雕刻城市，开采珍贵的金属和宝石，并打造值得荣耀的遗物。对许多石巨人来说，工艺是最崇高的使命，他们所有的创作都注重美感和持久性。",
	"{@b {@i Of the Stone.}}  Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their home—marble, granite, or even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.": "{@b {@i Of the Stone.}} 石巨人由构成他们家园的相同种类的岩石制成—大理石、花岗岩，甚至玄武岩。他们的石质身体不仅能保护他们免受攻击，还为他们提供了另一种自我表达的方式。他们经常在皮肤上雕刻符文，这些符文具有各种艺术和文化目的。",
	"Put some earth in your mouth. Dirt. Just a little, don't eat it. But if they see you know the ritual, they'll let you pass.": "把一些泥土放进你的嘴里。泥土。只是一点点，不要吃下去。但如果他们看到你知道这个仪式，他们会让你通过。",

But the players only get to have that fun if they know how the trait works, so be sure to share it with them.": "山岭巨人的“分心”特性为玩家角色提供了一个机会，让他们可以玩得开心并采取“嘿，这边！”的战术。但只有当玩家了解这个特性是如何运作的时候，他们才能享受到这种乐趣，所以一定要与他们分享这个信息。",
	"Stone giants made of different rocks ally with each other in times of war. These giants understand that their skills in battle complement one another. Marble giants wade into battle alongside basalt and granite giants. In times of peace, different stone giant groups share new secrets of rune magic and trade with one another.": "不同石头制成的石巨人在战争时结盟。这些巨人明白彼此在战斗中的技能是互补的。大理石巨人与玄武岩和花岗岩巨人一起冲入战场。在和平时期，不同的石巨人团体分享符文魔法的新秘密并相互贸易。",
	"This may leave you wanting more stone giants than the three in this book. You can create new stone giant stat blocks by taking a non-stone giant stat block from this section, giving it the stone giant's False Appearance and Stone Flesh traits, and giving it resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from mundane attacks that aren't adamantine. Then pick a type of stone you think fits the new stat block, and you're done! For instance, you could modify the {@creature fire giant red fist|FleeMortals} to create an obsidian giant, or you could use the {@creature frost giant wind sprinter|FleeMortals} to make a zircon giant.": "这可能会让你想要比这本书中的三个石巨人更多。您可以通过从本节中选择一个非石巨人的属性块，赋予它石巨人的虚假外表和石肤特性，并使其对来自非精金的普通攻击的钝击、刺击和斩击伤害具有抗性来创建新的石巨人属性块。然后选择一种您认为适合新属性块的石头类型，完成！例如，您可以修改{@creature fire giant red fist|FleeMortals}来创建黑曜石巨人，或者您可以使用{@creature frost giant wind sprinter|FleeMortals}来制作锆石巨人。",
	"Giant lairs are filled with clothing, furniture, tools, weapons, and even treasure that is sized for beings over 15 feet tall. The inside of a giant's lair should make the players feel as though their characters have shrunk as they navigate familiar setups, such as a mead hall, from a new perspective. Normally trivial activities, like grabbing an amulet off a table, become herculean tasks that require planning, preparation, and risk of bodily harm! This change of pace is fantastic fun.": "巨人巢穴里堆满了衣物、家具、工具、武器，甚至是为身高超过15英尺的生物设计的宝藏。巨人巢穴的内部应该让玩家感觉他们的角色已经缩小了，因为他们从新的角度探索熟悉的场景，比如一个酒厅。通常微不足道的活动，比如从桌子上拿一个护身符，变成了需要计划、准备和冒生命危险的艰巨任务！这种步调的改变非常有趣。",

Likewise, doorways should be at least 15 feet tall.": "巨人巢穴中的门道和走廊应至少有15英尺宽，这样巨人才能在走廊上舒适地行走而不用挤压。如果有多个巨人居住在巢穴中，考虑使走廊更宽以容纳多个巨人同时通过。同样，门道应至少有15英尺高。",
	"Giant-sized potions have the same amount of magic in a greater amount of liquid. A Medium or smaller creature must use three actions to consume the potion. The potion takes effect after the third action is used to consume it. If more than 1 minute passes between actions used to consume the potion, the potion loses its magic and has no effect.": "巨型药水中蕴含着同样的魔力，只是溶液量更大。中型或更小型生物必须使用三个动作来消耗这种药水。药水在第三个动作被使用后产生效果。如果在消耗药水的动作之间超过1分钟的时间，药水将失去魔力，没有任何效果。",

	"Stairs in giant lairs count as difficult terrain for Medium and smaller creatures.": "对于中型及更小的生物来说，（巨人巢穴）中的楼梯算作困难地形。",
	"Giants often craft traps meant to keep out other enemy giants as well as smaller folk. As such, their traps often affect larger areas. Their flame jets shoot wider and higher than humanoid traps, their pits are deeper, and their scythes cut at multiple heights.": "巨人经常制造陷阱，旨在阻止其他敌对巨人以及较小的人类。因此，他们的陷阱通常影响更大的区域。他们的火焰喷射器比人类陷阱射程更广更高，他们的陷阱更深，他们的镰刀在多个高度切割。",

Only recently did sages discover these creatures shared the same chaotic ancestry, though their appearance is so in flux that they can't be perceived the same way twice.": "{@b {@i Taxing Taxonomy.}} 咕噜咕噜的口吃者扭动着一团不断变化的身体部分。它们的名字是由一位探险家创造的，他描述了看到并逃离“一堆喋喋不休的嘴巴，说着已知和未知的语言”。其他冒险家也报告了类似的骨骼、肌肉和肢体的混合体，每一个比前一个更可怕。直到最近，学者们才发现这些生物有着相同的混乱血统，尽管它们的外表变化如此之快，以至于无法两次以同样的方式被感知。",
	"{@b {@i Chaos Gourmets.}} The gibbering mouther subsists on change the same way most creatures subsist on food and water. A gibbering mouther can treat themself to a feast just by finding their way to the Mundane World, where things are deliciously mutable. Though they can't make the trip on their own, gibbering mouthers seize any opportunity they can to travel, sneaking through mage portals and interdimensional rifts caused by wild magic. Some are summoned to the Mundane World by particularly malevolent forces, like zealous cultists, megalomaniacal mages, and others wanting to change or distract the world.": "{@b {@i Chaos Gourmets.}} 喃喃自语者依赖变化，就像大多数生物依赖食物和水一样。喃喃自语者可以通过找到通往平凡世界的方法来享用盛宴。虽然他们无法独自前往，但喃喃自语者会抓住任何机会旅行，通过法师传送门和野蛮魔法引起的次元裂缝偷偷穿越。有些喃喃自语者被特别邪恶的力量召唤到平凡世界，比如狂热的异教徒、狂妄的法师和其他想要改变或转移世界的人。",
	"{@b {@i Unconscionable Transformation.}} Living beings are especially susceptible to the reality-bending influence of the gibbering mouther. Those exposed to one of these creatures often return with a souvenir: an altered body. At first these effects are minor—their body might steadily flicker in and out of reality, or their face might sprout an additional nose. These effects always worsen, adding and rearranging body parts over time. Eventually, those who can't find supernatural help are transformed into gibbering mouthers themselves, roaming the Mundane World in search of a slice of reality to shift.": "{@b {@i Unconscionable Transformation.}} 生物特别容易受到咕噜咕噜嘴的现实扭曲影响。那些接触过这些生物的人经常会带回一个纪念品：一个被改变的身体。起初，这些影响很小——他们的身体可能会不断地在现实中消失和出现，或者他们的脸上可能会长出额外的鼻子。这些影响总是会恶化，随着时间的推移增加和重新排列身体部位。最终，那些找不到超自然帮助的人会被转变成咕噜咕噜嘴自己，漫游在（Mundane World）中寻找一块可以改变的现实。",
	"{@b {@i Gibbering Friend.}} On rare occasion, a gibbering mouther finds an adventurer who embodies chaos. Such a pairing can bring about an unlikely friendship; the gibbering mouther happily serves as a stalwart companion as long as their caretaker provides plenty of opportunities to warp reality. In even more unique circumstances, an adventurer turned into a gibbering mouther might resist the call of chaos and remain with their party.": "在罕见的情况下，一个咕噜咕噜者会找到一个体现混沌的冒险者。这样的组合可能会带来一段不太可能的友谊；只要他们的照料者提供了足够的机会来扭曲现实，咕噜咕噜者就会乐意充当坚定的伙伴。在更加独特的情况下，一个变成咕噜咕噜者的冒险者可能会抵抗混沌的召唤，并留在他们的队伍中。",

	"Gnolls aren't humanoids, but hyena-faced fiends—created by a dead demon lord, they carry his evil legacy wherever they roam. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll's muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. The pack's eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.": "豺狼人并非人形生物，而是长着鬣狗面孔的恶魔——由一位已故的恶魔领主创造，他们随处传播着他邪恶的遗产。豺狼人最初来自深渊荒地，迅速遍布时光之地，在沙漠、平原和其他人烟稀少的地方生存茁壮。尽管豺狼人的口吻往往被腐肉染血，而非猎物的血迹，它们的狩猎群体渴望暴力，热衷于袭击旅行者和掠夺定居点。豺狼人群的怪异战吼，一阵狂野的咯咯笑声，预示着一夜的战斗和恐怖。",
	"{@b {@i Born from Blood.}} The Abyssal Wasteland is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amidst its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas—bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of these predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As'sylrak the Warper. As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends \"gnoll,\" an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is \"to consume completely.\" And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.": "{@b {@i Born from Blood.}）深渊荒地是一个对大多数生物都充满敌意的外星景观。然而，在这片荒凉之中，恶魔般的生物茁壮成长，包括深渊鬣狗——嗜血的食腐者，他们与其他次等恶魔争夺恶魔尸体。第一批豺狼人是在一群这些捕食者舔着一个垂死的恶魔王子As'sylrak the Warper身上渗出的粘液时出现的。作为他的最后行动，恶魔赋予了这些恶魔般的鬣狗一种与他们无尽的饥饿相匹配的恶魔狡诈，将他邪恶的意志与他们的联系在一起，并将他们的爪子变成手，以便他们能够挥舞武器。他称这些新的恶魔为“gnoll”，这是一个有许多含义的深渊词汇，其中之一是“完全消耗”。与他们的名字相符，豺狼人立即吞噬了他们的创造者。",
	"{@b {@i Ceaseless Hunger.}} The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn't receive As'sylrak's blessing; these tagalongs enjoy the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh—and they hunger for more, longing for a day when gnolls hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.": "{@b {@i Ceaseless Hunger.}} 无情的豺狼迅速蔓延到时间空间中，寻找新的受害者来满足他们永无止境的饥饿。他们的群体后面跟着一些未得到阿斯拉克的祝福的深渊鬣狗；这些跟班喜欢吃豺狼群体的剩饭。豺狼们永远不会忘记他们尝到不朽肉体的那一天—他们渴望更多，渴望有一天豺狼们能够穿越天堂大厅追猎众神。",
	"{@b {@i Gnoll War.}} Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren't choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.": "{@b {@i Gnoll War.}} 大多数豺狼人为了狩猎的刺激和肉食而活，他们对目标并不挑剔。也许对大多数人类社区来说，唯一的救赎是豺狼人战队为了领地而互相争斗，从而减少了他们的数量。",
	"Gnoll enemies in your game might be a horde of demonic soldiers who charge wildly into battle, fight the first foe they see to the death, then move on to the next victim. In this case, a gnoll has little care for their own safety, let alone the protection of their allies, as they wade into the fray full of bloodlust. This strategy works well for an overwhelming number of gnolls fighting together and gives your players the sense that their characters are standing against a relentless horde.": "在你的游戏中，豺狼人敌人可能是一群恶魔士兵，疯狂地冲向战斗，与他们看到的第一个敌人战斗到死，然后转向下一个受害者。在这种情况下，豺狼人几乎不关心自己的安全，更不用说保护他们的盟友了，因为他们充满了嗜血的渴望冲入战斗。这种策略对于一大群豺狼人一起战斗效果很好，并让你的玩家感到他们的角色正在对抗一支无情的军队。",
	"You could also make gnoll villains more calculated in their approach to violence. A smaller band of gnolls might employ clever tactics, waiting until night to sneak up on the characters, starting fires to cover their escape, and focusing their fire on enemies who threaten their victory the most. These gnolls work together in a cohesive group with fiendish cunning.": "你也可以让豺狼人(Gnoll)的反派更加谨慎地对待暴力。一小队豺狼人可能会采用巧妙的战术，等到夜晚悄悄接近角色，点燃火焰以掩盖他们的逃跑，将火力集中在威胁他们胜利最大的敌人身上。这些豺狼人以邪恶的狡诈一起协作。",
	"Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.": "比它们野兽般的对应物更强大和更聪明，深渊鬣狗从深渊荒地爬出来，吞食着豺狼留下的尸体。当需要增援时，豺狼咒术师可以使用魔法将深渊鬣狗变成豺狼。",
	"Towering among a gnoll war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although tuskers usually follow gnoll commands, when they grow especially hungry for souls, they charge forward without regard to the allies they may trample.": "在一支豺狼战队中耸立着象牙巨魔，它既是货物的载体，又是战争机器。象牙巨魔除了扭曲的象牙冠围绕着它贪婪的口腔外，没有其他面部特征。尽管象牙巨魔通常听从豺狼的命令，但当它们对灵魂感到特别饥渴时，它们会不顾一切地向前冲，无视可能被践踏的盟友。",
	"Many gnolls don't mind using a cursed magic item if it conveys some benefit to them as well, like a {@item berserker axe} or {@item demon armor}. They also like to use magic items that allow them to destroy swaths of enemies and objects, like a {@item bead of force} or a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell shatter}.": "许多豺狼人并不介意使用被诅咒的魔法物品，只要它们能给他们带来一些好处，比如一个{@item berserker axe}或{@item demon armor}。他们还喜欢使用那些能让他们摧毁大片敌人和物体的魔法物品，比如一个{@item bead of force}或一个{@item spell scroll}的{@spell shatter}。",

	"Like hyenas, gnolls make a sound akin to human giggling when they face danger. When this sound comes on the wind in the darkness of night, it can be a chilling warning that precedes a gnoll raid. If your players enjoy a little nervous anticipation before a fight, describe or act out the gnoll laughter, noting its volume increasing as their foes draw ever closer. You could also find a video of a hyena laughing online and play it for them.": "就像鬣狗一样，豺狼人在面对危险时会发出类似于人类咯咯笑的声音。当这种声音在夜晚的黑暗中随风传来时，它可能是一种令人毛骨悚然的警告，预示着豺狼人的袭击即将到来。如果你的玩家喜欢在战斗前感到一些紧张的期待，可以描述或模仿豺狼人的笑声，注意随着敌人越来越接近，音量会逐渐增加。你也可以在网上找到一段鬣狗笑声的视频，播放给他们听。",

	"{@b {@i Encountered in Groups.}} In society and in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely (and perhaps overly) confident. Such groups often become bandits that ambush travelers in their territories, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger bands may become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they're encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and flee when foes outnumber friends.": "{@b {@i Encountered in Groups.}} 在社会中或流亡中，地精之所以能够生存和繁荣，是因为它们团结一致。一个被迫独自进入荒野的地精会感到恐惧。一打地精强盗则极其自信（也许过于自信）。这样的团体经常成为在自己的领地上伏击旅行者的强盗，无论是在沙漠、森林还是地下。规模更大的团伙可能会成为为强大恶棍效力的肆无忌惮的雇佣兵。无论如何遭遇，地精都喜欢作为压倒性力量进行战斗，并在敌人超过朋友时逃跑。",

	"{@b {@i Mobile and Sneaky.}} Short, lithe, and long-armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing.

During raids, the spider flicks their abdomen to launch warriors off their back into the fray.": "哥布林在战斗中骑着巨大的蜘蛛作为坐骑。战蜘蛛的刀片般的腿在敌军中快速移动，而弓箭手则站在兽背上的平台上射击。在突袭中，蜘蛛会用腹部甩动，将战士从背上抛向战场。",
	"Queen Bargnot, Scourge of the High Road, leads the Jagged Edge Goblins in pillaging caravans. Before her rise, the goblins struggled, attacking only the weakest travelers in unorganized strikes.

Each aerie holds up to three eggs during brooding season, which lasts for several months in the early spring. Chicks hatch after forty days of incubation, then they remain in or near the nest as their parents feed the rapidly growing flightless chick.

	"Named for their infamous hunting technique, kingfissure worms terraform the earth as they move, building tunnels and crevasses to accommodate their enormous form. They then lie in wait deep underground. When they sense the vibrations of their prey above, they shoot their serpentine tongues through the crevasses, dragging prey from the surface into the worm's cavernous maw. Seasoned adventurers know to be wary when traveling past even the smallest crack in the earth.": "以他们臭名昭著的狩猎技术命名，裂地王蠕虫在移动时改变地表形态，挖掘隧道和裂缝以适应它们巨大的身躯。然后它们潜伏在地下深处。当它们感知到地表上猎物的振动时，它们会通过裂缝射出蛇形舌头，将猎物从地表拖入蠕虫巨大的口中。经验丰富的冒险者知道，即使是地表上最小的裂缝也要小心谨慎地通过。",
	"{@b {@i Intestine Inventory.}} The worm eats indiscriminately, swallowing creatures, structures, and precious gems alike. The wealth inside a kingfissure worm would put any dragon's hoard to shame, though the worm cares nothing for treasure and knows nothing of the spoils lodged in their labyrinthine intestines. Few people have seen the inside of a kingfissure worm and lived, but those who do usually escape with a precious souvenir or two.": "{@b {@i Intestine Inventory.}} 这种蠕虫吞食不加选择，无论是生物、建筑物还是珍贵的宝石都一视同仁。一个王裂虫体内的财富足以让任何一只龙的宝藏相形见绌，尽管这种蠕虫对财宝毫不在意，也对藏在其迷宫般肠道中的战利品一无所知。很少有人见过王裂虫的内部并活着出来，但那些幸存者通常会带着一两件珍贵的纪念品逃脱。",
	"{@b {@i Home Renovators.}} Most worms build a den of tunnels and fissures, remaining in it for as long as the pickings on the surface are good and they aren't disturbed. When a kingfissure worm seeks a new home, they target areas with abundant food—occasionally leading to villagers waking up to find their surrounding lands have been terraformed overnight. Residents of such lands generally have two choices: pack up and leave, or prepare for battle. If a worm is somehow defeated, all manner of creatures and communities try to lay claim to the worm's underground structures. These empty dens make wonderful war bunkers, isolated workshops, and even highly defensible villages.": "{@b {@i Home Renovators.}} 大多数蠕虫会建造一座由隧道和裂缝构成的巢穴，在表面资源丰富且不受干扰的情况下会长期留在里面。当一只(`kingfissure`)王裂缝蠕虫寻找新家时，它们会选择有丰富食物的地区——有时会导致村民们醒来发现他们周围的土地在一夜之间被改造。这些土地的居民通常有两个选择：收拾行李离开，或者准备战斗。如果一只蠕虫被某种方式打败，各种生物和社区都会试图占领蠕虫的地下结构。这些空荡荡的巢穴可以成为出色的战争掩体、隐秘的工作坊，甚至是极具防御性的村庄。",
	"{@b {@i Unstoppable Force.}} The kingfissure worm is a species determined to outrun, outlast, and out-eat every other living creature.

	"{@b {@i Unlikely Symbiosis.}} Some nomadic communities or adventurers travel dangerous lands with the help of an unusual guardian—a juvenile kingfissure worm. So long as the people provide a steady supply of food for the worm, the kingfissure follows dutifully. And if the people attract monsters from above, the worm defends their companions while enjoying an extra meal.": "{@b {@i Unlikely Symbiosis.}} 一些游牧社区或冒险家在危险的土地上旅行时，会得到一种不同寻常的守护者的帮助——幼年的王裂谷虫。只要人们为这只虫子提供稳定的食物供应，王裂谷虫就会忠实地跟随。如果人们引来了来自上方的怪物，这只虫子会保护他们的同伴，同时享受额外的一餐。",

	"Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry centurion, they pose a significant threat.": "狗头人社区，称为军团，分布在各种生态区域和时空之中。狗头人倾向于与强大的盟友和易守的地点结合，它们在有城墙的城市、僻静的寺庙、地下隧道迷宫和龙穴中同样常见。大多数军团努力成为好邻居或完全不被注意，但当一个社区受到邪恶的巨龙或渴望权力的百夫长的影响时，它们就构成了重大威胁。",
	"{@b {@i Defensive Masters.}} In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary; every warrior carries a shield into battle, and soldiers defend each other in tightly choreographed formations.

	"{@b {@i Unconventional Tactics.}} Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn't take them seriously.

In open warfare, legions deploy mechanical dragons and flaming spike pit traps.": "{@b {@i Unconventional Tactics.}} 不知疲倦的创新者，(kobolds)能轻易地智胜任何不将他们认真对待的人。他们的敌人在经历过爆炸的标枪或燃烧的网之前，并不算真正体验过(kobold)的战斗。(Kobold)的家园被致命的危险和伏击点所保护。在开放战争中，军团会部署机械龙和燃烧的尖刺陷阱。",
	"Tiny Dragons. Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons—and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant chromatic, metallic, or crystalline scales; as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives under the patronage of a dragon adopts the color of their patron's scales over several generations.": "微型龙族。大多数龙裔族认为他们的祖先是由强大的龙创造的——而且以他们尖锐的棱角特征和突出的背脊冠，他们看起来确实符合这个形象！新生的龙裔有着明亮的色彩、金属或晶体鳞片；随着龙裔的年龄增长，它们的鳞片会变暗并斑驳。由于深厚的魔法联系，一个生活在龙的庇护下的军团会在几代人中逐渐采用其庇护者鳞片的颜色。",
	"Kobolds train drangolins—draconic pangolins—to dig residential tunnel networks and neutralize enemy fortifications. While drangolins can curl into balls and smash through obstacles, kobold tacticians prefer to go under walls instead of through them. After burrowing, the drangolin erupts into the center of an enemy camp, then kobold legionaries pour out through the tunnel.": "狗头人训练龙甲壳兽—龙族穿山甲—挖掘住宅隧道网络并摧毁敌方防御工事。虽然龙甲壳兽可以卷成球并撞破障碍物，但狗头人军事策略家更倾向于绕过墙壁而不是直接穿越。在挖掘完成后，龙甲壳兽会突然出现在敌营中心，然后狗头人军团士兵会从隧道中涌出。",
	"{@b {@i Made of Shields.}} Kobold legions decorate their drangolin's scales to match their own shields' designs, and warriors consider it a good omen when the scale they painted blocks a blow.

	"The kobolds in this book are built to work together. We found out during playtesting that they worked a little too well together after these little lizards murdered several dozen player characters.

Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you who can see you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your exploit save DC or be {@condition blinded} for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.": "{@b {@i Unleash Sunlight.}} 作为一个奖励动作，你让你的皮肤闪耀着明亮的光芒。 你选择的每个在你周围10英尺内且能看到你的生物必须通过你的利用豁免 DC 的体质豁免检定，否则会在1分钟内被{@condition blinded}（豁免在回合结束时结束）。一旦你使用了这个奖励动作，你必须休息长时间后才能再次使用。",
	"Lizardfolk prefer warm, tropical climes, but they're willing to settle in any humid region—the more moisture in the air, the better. Even in colder climates, lizardfolk can be found in any sufficiently marshy environment. Bogs and wetlands are favorites.": "蜥蜴人偏爱温暖、热带气候，但他们也愿意在任何潮湿地区定居——空气中的湿度越高越好。即使在寒冷气候中，蜥蜴人也可以在任何足够多沼泽环境中找到。沼泽和湿地是他们的最爱。",
	"Their scales protect both against weapons and the moisture in their native environments. Coloring and hue vary wildly with environment and diet.": "它们的鳞片既能抵御武器，也能抵御本地环境中的湿气。颜色和色调会因环境和饮食而大不相同。",
	"Lizardfolk aren't especially hostile unless they feel their territory is threatened—which they often feel, because it often is. But for respectful travelers, entering lizardfolk territory need be no great hardship. Lizardfolk cultures often take up a specific trade, like boatmaking, fletching, weaving, or navigating, and they sell their services to travelers in need, including lizardfolk from other places.": "蜥蜴人并不特别好斗，除非他们觉得自己的领土受到了威胁——而他们经常会有这种感觉，因为通常确实如此。但对于尊重的旅行者来说，进入蜥蜴人领土并不会带来太大困难。蜥蜴人文化通常会从事特定的行业，比如造船、制箭、织布或航海，并向有需要的旅行者出售他们的服务，包括来自其他地方的蜥蜴人。",
	"{@b {@i Homeland Protectors.}} Adventurers cross paths with lizardfolk while trekking through their homelands. The reptilian humanoids watch travelers who skirt too close to sources of food and shelter, attacking those who take more than they need. Many lizardfolk dwell in caverns and abandoned ruins for protection. Treasure-seekers who delve into these places are typically given one warning before the attack begins.": "{@b {@i Homeland Protectors.}} 冒险者在穿越蜥蜴人的家园时与他们相遇。这些爬行人形生物会观察那些靠近食物和庇护来源的旅行者，对那些贪得无厌的人发动攻击。许多蜥蜴人居住在洞穴和废墟中以躲避危险。那些深入这些地方寻宝的人通常会在袭击开始前得到一次警告。",
	"{@b {@i Focused and Loyal.}} Most lizardfolk speak plainly, viewing blunt honesty as a sign of respect. When they make a vow or personal promise, they do all they can to honor that word. Lizardfolk who swear to destroy an enemy follow their quarry to the ends of the earth.": "{@b {@i Focused and Loyal.}} 大多数蜥蜴人直言不讳，认为直率的诚实是一种尊重的表现。当他们发誓或做出个人承诺时，他们会尽力遵守这个诺言。发誓要消灭敌人的蜥蜴人会追随他们的猎物到世界的尽头。",
	"{@b {@i Marshland Tyrants.}} In times of crisis, such as a food shortage, an evil lizardfolk leader can exploit the emergency, oppressing others in the name of defending their territory. But there are always other local lizardfolk tribes who oppose such aggressive, expansionist posturing; they often seek the aid of others who value freedom from tyranny.": "在危机时期，比如食物短缺，一个邪恶的蜥蜴人领袖可以利用紧急情况，以捍卫自己领土的名义压迫他人。但总会有其他当地的蜥蜴人部落反对这种侵略性的姿态；他们经常寻求那些重视摆脱暴政的人的帮助。",
	"Lizardfolk prefer to take on enemies in the water, since their swimming speed and Amphibious trait give them the upper hand against enemies without those traits. Bloodeyes, grunts, and scaletooths grapple or restrain enemies to keep them underwater, while terrorsaurs patrol above the surface, hunting any foe who dares to escape.": "蜥蜴人更喜欢在水中对抗敌人，因为他们的游泳速度和两栖特性让他们对没有这些特性的敌人占据上风。血眼族、喘息族和鳞齿族会抓住或限制敌人，使其留在水下，而恐龙巨兽则在水面上巡逻，猎杀任何敢于逃脱的敌人。",
	"They shed their tails! So cool! Of course then everyone wants lizardfolk tails as spell ingredients—that's not so cool. It doesn't even do anything!": "它们脱掉了它们的尾巴！太酷了！当然，接着每个人都想要蜥蜴人的尾巴作为魔法材料—这就不那么酷了。它甚至什么都做不了！",
	"Many of the lizardfolk traits and actions are inspired by real-world lizard anatomy. For instance, the horned lizard shoots blood from its eyes when threatened, inspiring the lizardfolk bloodeye's Bloodeye Bolt action. The draco lizard has ribs connected by folds of skin that can extend and retract, forming wings that allow them to glide from tree to tree. The terrorsaur takes inspiration from the draco lizard.": "许多蜥蜴人的特征和行为灵感来自于现实世界的蜥蜴解剖结构。例如，角蜥会在受到威胁时从眼睛射出血液，这启发了蜥蜴人血眼（Bloodeye）的“血眼箭”（Bloodeye Bolt）动作。飞龙蜥有着通过皮肤褶皱连接的肋骨，可以伸展和收缩，形成翅膀，让它们能够从树上滑翔到另一棵树上。恐爪龙（terrorsaur）也受到飞龙蜥的启发。",
	"A weary traveler hears a clarion call through the forest or friendly voices from a rocky shelter, and their heart leaps at the promise of refuge—only to find themself at the mercy of serrated teeth and poisoned spikes. In a manticore's territory, people go missing without a trace. These fearsome creatures carve out their hunting grounds in forests near small villages, mountain passes where caravans travel, and other locations with plentiful wildlife. While manticores can subsist on a carnivorous diet of any nearby prey, their choicest meal is humanoid flesh.": "一位疲惫的旅行者在森林中听到一声号角声或者从岩石避难所传来友好的声音，他们的心为庇护的承诺而跃动—只是最终发现自己处于锯齿和有毒尖刺的威胁之下。在蝎尾狮(`manticore`)的领地里，人们会神秘失踪。这些可怕的生物在靠近小村庄的森林、商队经过的山间小道以及其他有丰富野生动物的地方划定了它们的狩猎领地。虽然蝎尾狮可以以附近任何猎物为食维持生存，但它们最喜欢的食物是人类的肉体。",
	"{@b {@i Uncanny Appearances.}} A manticore has a lion's body, a dragon's wings, and a scorpion's tail barbed with spines, but their most unnerving trait is their humanoid face. Owing to a quirk of magical evolution, manticores develop the features of common mortal lineages that populate their region of birth. For example, a manticore in an area densely populated by tieflings inherits fiendish eyes and devilish horns. Manticores are born with an inherent understanding of a regional language, but they can speak only through mimicking that which they've heard—a talent manticores use to lure in prey.": "{@b {@i Uncanny Appearances.}} 狮身蝎尾(狮身蝎尾兽)拥有狮子的身体、龙的翅膀和带刺的蝎子尾巴，但它们最令人不安的特征是拥有人类的面孔。由于魔法进化的特殊性，狮身蝎尾兽会发展出出生地区常见的凡人血统特征。例如，在一个密集居住着提弗林的地区，狮身蝎尾兽会继承邪恶的眼睛和恶魔般的角。狮身蝎尾兽天生就能理解当地语言，但它们只能通过模仿所听到的声音来说话——这是狮身蝎尾兽用来引诱猎物的天赋。",
	"{@b {@i Heralds of Death.}} Manticores have a magical howl like a trumpet. This haunting sound not only terrifies creatures, but makes them more susceptible to the manticore's bite. While on the hunt, manticores often take to the skies, shooting poison-tipped spikes from their tail to weaken their victims before howling and closing in.": "{@b {@i Heralds of Death.}} 螳螂兽有着像号角般的魔法嚎叫。这种令人心悸的声音不仅会让生物感到恐惧，还会让它们更容易受到螳螂兽的咬击。在狩猎时，螳螂兽经常会飞上天空，从尾部射出带有毒刺的尖刺，削弱猎物，然后发出嚎叫并逼近。",
	"{@b {@i Ferocious Companions.}} A manticore who develops a taste for humanoids can rarely be tamed. But a young manticore who has yet to cut their teeth on such flesh can be raised into a fearsome ally. After a trained manticore companion finally tastes delicious humanoid flesh, they typically remain loyal to their caregiver.": "{@b {@i Ferocious Companions.}} 一只对人类产生兴趣的蝎尾兽很少能被驯服。但一只还未嗜食过这类肉的幼年蝎尾兽可以被培养成为可怕的盟友。在一个训练有素的蝎尾兽伙伴尝过美味的人类肉后，它们通常会保持对其照顾者的忠诚。",

	"Hunted as monsters with no thought given to their nature or origin, few creatures are as underestimated and misunderstood as medusas. Many people fear medusas for their monstrous appearance and ability to turn others to stone, but few realize the truth. Each of these monstrosities was once a humanoid, cursed and transformed for defying a god—but while some medusas embrace wickedness, others simply fight for their lives against ignorant hunters.": "被当作怪物追捕，没有人考虑过它们的本质或起源，很少有生物像美杜莎那样被低估和误解。许多人因为它们的怪物外表和将他人变成石头的能力而害怕美杜莎，但很少有人意识到真相。这些怪物中的每一个曾经是一个人类，因为违抗了一个神而被诅咒和转变——但虽然有些美杜莎 embrace wickedness，其他一些只是为了对抗无知的猎人而拼命求生。",
	"{@b {@i Cursed for Defiance.}} When a powerful mortal defies a god for good or for ill, the deity may curse them to live as a medusa. The offender's skin and eyes become reptilian, and a nest of black venomous snakes replaces their hair. When the medusa wishes, beams from their eyes can slowly petrify others to stone.": "{@b {@i Cursed for Defiance.}} 当一个强大的凡人无论是出于善意还是恶意违抗了一个神祇，那个神祇可能会诅咒他们成为一个美杜莎。罪犯的皮肤和眼睛会变成爬行动物般的，头发会被一团黑色有毒的蛇取代。当美杜莎愿意时，她的眼睛发出的光束可以慢慢将他人石化。",
	"The gods who use this punishment spread terrifying myths about medusas, causing mortals to attack and shun them. This often drives medusas into solitude—or to places haunted by creatures who don't judge them based on mere appearance and horror stories.": "使用这种惩罚的神灵传播了关于美杜莎的可怕神话，导致凡人攻击和避开她们。这经常会让美杜莎陷入孤独，或者前往那些不会仅仅根据外表和恐怖故事来评判她们的地方。",
	"{@b {@i Warriors for Good or Ill.}} Though they might be secluded, medusas rarely stay idle. Many plot ways to break their curse, searching for lost healing rituals or secrets to use against the gods who cursed them. Others embrace their new gifts, building stone gardens of victims who foolishly hunted or harmed them.": "{@b {@i Warriors for Good or Ill.}} 尽管他们可能被隔离，美杜莎们很少闲着。许多人都在策划着打破他们的诅咒的方法，寻找失落的治疗仪式或对抗诅咒他们的神明的秘密。其他人则接受了他们的新礼物，建造了石头园，里面是那些愚蠢地追捕或伤害他们的受害者。",
	"{@b {@i Serpentine Reflexes.}} While the medusa's stone gaze is legendary, they also can move and strike as swiftly as a snake. This enhanced dexterity makes them incredible archers, and most prefer to fight at range.": "{@b {@i Serpentine Reflexes.}} 虽然美杜莎的石化凝视是传奇的，但它们也可以像蛇一样迅速移动和攻击。这种增强的灵活性使它们成为了不可思议的弓箭手，大多数更喜欢远程战斗。",
	"{@b {@i Lifting the Curse.}} The deity who inflicted a medusa's curse can rarely be convinced to lift the punishment, usually by undertaking an impossible task in the god's name or making a threat they can't ignore. Some sages claim ancient rituals can undo a god's curse, but these lost secrets are hidden by wrathful divine servants—and performing such a ritual would almost certainly entail great sacrifice.": "{@b {@i Lifting the Curse.}} 那位施加美杜莎咒语的神祇很少会被说服解除惩罚，通常需要以神的名义完成一项不可能的任务或者发出他们无法忽视的威胁。一些贤者声称古老的仪式可以解除神的诅咒，但这些失传的秘密被愤怒的神仆们隐藏着——而且执行这样的仪式几乎肯定会牺牲巨大。",
	"Medusas find privacy and solace in the shadows, often occupying abandoned ruins in lonely mountains or caves with lofty ceilings. Statues of a medusa's victims usually litter the area.": "美杜莎在阴影中寻找隐私和安宁，通常占据在偏僻山区或洞穴中的废弃遗迹，这些地方往往有高耸的天花板。(%num%)的受害者雕像通常散落在周围。",
	"When Lady Emer was human, she excelled as a scout in the mercenary Order of the Ouroboros. As her fame grew, she openly proclaimed that one day she would ascend to godhood. Emer hired bards to sing of her inevitable rise to the heavens, and their words reached the ears of the gods. Those lyrics damned Emer—but she saw her transformation not as a curse, but as an advantage, and her ambitions grew.": "当埃默夫人还是人类时，她在蛇食鱼尾佣兵团中表现出色，成为一名侦察员。随着她的名声日盛，她公开宣称总有一天她会升格为神。埃默雇佣诗人歌颂她不可避免的天上之路，他们的歌词传达到了神灵的耳中。那些歌词诅咒了埃默，但她将自己的转变视为一种优势，她的野心也因此膨胀。",
	"The leaders of the Order of the Ouroboros accepted Emer's new form as a unique opportunity. She secretly serves the order as an assassin, though most members don't realize it.

The medusa takes promising tomes back to her lair, where she searches for secrets to help her achieve godhood.": "`Ouroboros（无尽蛇）教团`的领袖们接受了Emer的新形态，视其为一个独特的机会。她秘密地作为刺客为教团服务，尽管大多数成员并不知情。教团付给她报酬，她完成任务后不会有任何问题。作为她服务的交换条件，教团也允许Emer进入他们的图书馆。这位美杜莎将有前途的卷轴带回她的巢穴，她在那里搜寻秘密，以帮助自己实现神格化。",

	"A mimic can make their home in any environment. So long as the area has prey and places to hide—among tree branches, along the faults of a cliff, or behind the baubles of a crowded bazaar stall—a mimic can wait for the perfect moment to strike.": "拟态怪可以在任何环境中建立自己的家园。只要这个区域有猎物和藏身之处——比如树枝间、悬崖裂缝间，或者拥挤市集货摊后面的小饰物——拟态怪就可以等待最佳时机发动攻击。",
	"{@b {@i Sticks to You.}} A mimic can make any part of their skin sticky. This allows them to climb most surfaces and attach to unfortunate creatures who touch them, which is why mimics in dungeons often disguise themselves as tempting treasures.": "{@b {@i Sticks to You.}} 拟态怪可以使他们的皮肤任何部分变得黏性。这使他们能够爬上大多数表面，并附着在不幸触碰他们的生物身上，这就是为什么地牢中的拟态怪经常伪装成诱人的宝藏。",
	"{@b {@i Panic Shifting.}} When a mimic feels pain, they can quickly compress their body into a dense object, popping a bouquet of boney spikes out of their skin. Threatened mimics can remain in this form indefinitely, and they often use it as a warning sign to predators that they are hard to swallow.": "{@b {@i Panic Shifting.}} 当模仿兽感到疼痛时，它们可以迅速将身体压缩成一种密实的物体，从皮肤上突然冒出一束骨刺。受到威胁的模仿兽可以长时间保持这种形态，并经常将其用作对捕食者发出的警告信号，表明它们难以下咽。",

They often cleverly use a former victim's pleas for help to attract would-be heroes as the mimic's latest meal.": "{@b {@i Mimic Sounds.}} 虽然拟态兽不懂语言，但它们可以模仿听到的声音，包括人类的语言。它们经常巧妙地利用前一位受害者的求救声来吸引那些想要成为英雄的人，作为拟态兽的最新一餐。",
	"{@b {@i Well-Fed Companions.}} When a mimic's hunger is satisfied, they become docile. Most can wait weeks between meals, sitting patiently in the form of a barrel or rock. If a daring adventurer feeds a mimic until it is docile, the monstrosity may become fond of that hero. They follow and defend this reliable food source, and if the bond grows strong enough, they may even allow the adventurer to wear them like clothing.": "{@b {@i Well-Fed Companions.}} 当模仿兽的饥饿得到满足时，它们会变得温顺。大多数模仿兽可以在餐食之间等待数周，耐心地呆在桶或石头的形态中。如果一个大胆的冒险者喂养模仿兽直到它变得温顺，这个怪物可能会喜欢上那位英雄。它们会跟随并保护这个可靠的食物来源，如果这种联系变得足够牢固，它们甚至可能允许冒险者像穿衣服一样穿戴它们。",
	"Used as Distractions. Spies, thieves, and others who wish to walk into guarded locations unnoticed plant a mimic as a distraction just outside the restricted area they need to enter. The mastermind can slip in during the mimic's initial rampage and then more easily sneak out while the guardians spread thin throughout the complex, poking every vase and floor tile with a halberd to make sure there are no more monstrosities in the area.": "用作干扰。间谍、小偷和其他希望在不被注意的情况下进入受保护地点的人会在他们需要进入的限制区域外放置一个拟态体作为干扰。主谋可以在拟态体刚开始暴走时溜进去，然后更容易地在守卫在整个建筑物里四处分散时溜出去，用戟戟探查每个花瓶和地砖，确保该区域没有更多的怪物。",
	"{@b {@i Unseen Assassins.}} Hired killers find a relationship with a mimic can be quite profitable, as the assassin can infiltrate their target's space and leave the shapechanger to do the dirty work. These trained mimics can lie in wait for days, pretending to be a benign chest or wardrobe.

The Beast Lords placed this minotaur at the center of a vast labyrinth and sent captured rebels to attack the monster. Many fell to Thesia's anger—until a prisoner named Velathri took a chance, speaking to the minotaur instead of brandishing steel. He befriended Thesia, and in retribution, the Beast Lords made him a minotaur as well. This act was their undoing, for Thesia and Velathri fell in love. New minotaurs were born, and decades later, hundreds charged out of the maze together. These minotaurs reduced Kham to ruins, then they spread far and wide, fearing reprisal from neighboring lands. Even today, many minotaurs shun civilization, preferring to live in winding canyons, twisting ruins, bewildering dungeons, or other maze-like terrain where they can continue to hunt. However, a few can be found in nearly any terrain or settlement.": "{@b {@i Labyrinthine Origins.}} 第一个牛头人曾是人类战士Thesia \"The Bull\" Danaria，曾挑战卡姆的兽王。当她的革命被镇压时，卡姆的兽王们利用他们的兽法将Thesia的凡体扭曲成一个容易陷入暴怒的人牛混合体。兽王们将这个牛头人放在一个巨大迷宫的中心，并派遣被俘的叛军去攻击这个怪物。许多人都被Thesia的愤怒所击倒，直到一个名叫Velathri的囚犯冒险，与牛头人交谈而非挥舞钢铁。他与Thesia交友，作为报复，兽王们也让他成为了一个牛头人。这个行为导致了他们的失败，因为Thesia和Velathri相爱了。新的牛头人诞生了，几十年后，数百个一起冲出了迷宫。这些牛头人摧毁了卡姆，然后他们四处散布，害怕邻近土地的报复。即使在今天，许多牛头人仍然回避文明，更喜欢生活在蜿蜒的峡谷、错综复杂的废墟、令人困惑的地牢或其他类似迷宫的地形中，他们可以继续狩猎。然而，也有一些牛头人可以在几乎任何地形或定居点找到。",

The truth of such legends remains unknown, but many cruel ogres use them as an excuse for their selfish indulgences.": "{@b {@i Savory Stories.}} 一些食人魔讲述过一个时代，他们分享着巨大的财富和财宝，由凿石而成的宏伟住所，以及丰盛的盛宴。这些故事以不同的恶棍结尾——从欺诈的法师到会说话的猫——骗取了食人魔应得的一切。这些传说的真相仍然未知，但许多残忍的食人魔将其作为自私放纵的借口。",
	"{@b {@i Aristocracy of Bullies.}} When wicked ogres gather more food than they can stomach or riches than they can spend, they use the excess to tempt their kin into working for them.

Many ogre communities form around these arrogant aristocrats—but few such leaders die of old age, as the ambition and emotions of their subjects bring about violent ends.": "{@b {@i Aristocracy of Bullies.}} 当邪恶的食人魔聚集了比他们能消化的食物或比他们能花费的财富时，他们会利用多余的东西来诱使他们的同类为他们工作。这些小人物让其他食人魔在他们脚下匍匐，为了一点残羹剩饭，然后派他们出去偷更多的东西。许多食人魔社区都围绕着这些傲慢的贵族形成——但很少有这样的领袖能够死于老年，因为他们的臣民的野心和情绪会导致他们暴力的结局。",

Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics.": "兽人的历史横跨世界各个时代。他们定居在村庄和城市，无论是在炎热还是寒冷的气候中，无论是在高山上还是深处地下。大多数兽人生活在多样化的人类社会中，尽管也有一些生活在热带地区的隐居部落中。",

	"Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances.

	"{@b {@i Verdant Camouflage.}} Rather than slowly chase prey, the shambling mound prefers to drape their form along well-traveled paths.

	"Time raiders are built to quickly get into a location, accomplish a task, and get out. Archons leave their foes dazed, making it difficult for enemies to chase the time raiders.

Violence is rarely a treant's first course of action, but they have no interest in negotiating with anyone they deem untrustworthy. A provoked treant offers a single stern warning, which only the most foolish intruders ignore. When enemies inevitably flee, the treant rarely gives chase outside the bounds of their woods, satisfied they have defended their charge.": "{@b {@i Nature's Guardians.}} 树人对自然和他们的家园森林有着深刻的共鸣。许多树人树林守护着特殊区域，比如德鲁伊的树林或原始魔法的源头。这些坚定的守护者毫不犹豫地面对可疑的旅行者，并且很可能会攻击那些对森林行为鲁莽的人。暴力很少是树人的首选，但他们对那些被视为不值得信任的人没有任何谈判兴趣。被激怒的树人会发出一次严厉的警告，只有最愚蠢的闯入者会无视。当敌人不可避免地逃离时，树人很少会追击到森林之外，他们满足于已经捍卫了自己的责任。",
	"{@b {@i One with the Forest.}} The magic within treants touches the webs of magic connecting their forest, allowing them to call forth vines and heal allies. Their roots sense the vibrations of nearby creatures. Treants can speak with both plants and animals, many of whom who act as their scouts.": "{@b {@i One with the Forest.}} 树人内心的魔法触及连接它们森林的魔法之网，使它们能够召唤藤蔓并治愈盟友。它们的根部能感知附近生物的振动。树人能与植物和动物交谈，其中许多人充当它们的侦察员。",
	"{@b {@i Treant Arrows.}} When another creatures risks their life for the forest standing side by side with a treant, the plant rewards the bravery by giving them one or more treant arrows.": "{@b {@i Treant Arrows.}} 当另一个生物冒着生命危险与树人并肩站在一起时，植物会通过赠送一个或多个树人箭矢来奖励这种勇气。",
	"The embodiment of carnivorous hunger, trolls rampage through the wild, leaving destruction in their wake. Tall and gangly, their mottled green skin is covered by a mane of matted hair that runs around their neck and down their back. In many ways, they resemble massive humanoids, but their exaggerated features belie this comparison; their lower jaw hangs unhinged and distended, and their long arms end in claws which drag along the ground as they walk.": "食肉饥饿的化身，巨魔在荒野中肆虐，留下毁灭性的痕迹。他们又高又瘦，斑驳的绿色皮肤被一头缠绕在颈部和背部的乱发覆盖着。在许多方面，他们看起来像巨大的人形生物，但他们夸张的特征却与这种比较不符；他们的下颚悬垂而扭曲，长长的手臂末端是拖在地面上行走的爪子。",
	"{@b {@i Hypermetabolism.}} A troll's constant hunger and aggression begets a life of violence. Like a grotesque miracle, they quickly assimilate consumed flesh into themselves to regenerate their body. Some scholars think this extreme metabolic process is the source of their hunger, but none know for certain which came first.": "{@b {@i Hypermetabolism.}}巨魔的饥饿和攻击性导致了暴力的生活。就像一个怪诞的奇迹，它们迅速将消化的肉融入自己的身体中，以重生。一些学者认为这种极端的新陈代谢过程是它们饥饿的根源，但没有人确切知道哪个是先有的。",
	"{@b {@i Phases of Destruction.}} Fortunately for the ecosystems they inhabit, trolls can't be active all the time. Their natural behavior is to hunt relentlessly for a few days, then return to their dens to rest for as much as a week. Patient troll hunters can wait for this hibernation and catch the trolls by surprise—though the cost of waiting can be high, thanks to the damage the trolls might do in the meantime.": "{@b {@i Phases of Destruction.}} 幸运的是，对于它们栖息地的生态系统来说，巨魔并不总是活跃的。它们的自然行为是连续几天不停地狩猎，然后返回洞穴休息长达一周。耐心的巨魔猎人可以等待它们的冬眠期，然后出其不意地捕捉巨魔——尽管等待的代价可能很高，因为在此期间巨魔可能造成的破坏。",
	"{@b {@i Strange Mutations.}} Though a troll's preferred prey are humanoids and beasts, stories circulate of them feeding on undead, aberrations, and even celestials, assimilating their flesh to magnificent and horrifying effect.": "{@b {@i Strange Mutations.}} 尽管巨魔更喜欢捕食人形生物和野兽，但也有传说称它们会捕食不死生物、畸变生物，甚至天界生物，将它们的肉体融合在一起，产生壮丽而可怕的效果。",
	"{@b {@i Limbjumbles.}} When a suitably large piece of mutated troll is torn off in battle, it does its very best to keep on living. Mutation and deep-seated survival instinct go into overdrive, sprouting unthinkable assortments of malformed arms and legs. Though these limbjumbles are ultimately short-lived, they can often be found tumbling awkwardly behind living trolls.": "{@b {@i Limbjumbles.}} 当在战斗中撕下一块足够大的变异巨魔肉块时，它会竭尽全力继续生存。变异和根深蒂固的生存本能会超负荷运转，长出难以想象的各种畸形手臂和腿。尽管这些肢体混乱最终寿命有限，但常常可以看到它们笨拙地跟在活着的巨魔身后。",
	"At the GM's discretion, a troll can mutate after consuming the flesh of an alien, powerful, or supernaturally created creature, gaining some of their prey's damage immunities and resistances, traits, or actions. For instance, a troll who devours a blue dragon might gain the creature's immunity to lightning damage and Lightning Breath action. Be aware this can significantly increase the difficulty trolls present in combat—especially if their mutations deal more damage than normal or grant immunity to acid or fire damage.": "在(GM)的裁量下，巨魔在消耗外星生物、强大生物或超自然创造生物的肉体后，可能会发生变异，获得部分猎物的伤害免疫和抗性、特质或行动。例如，吞食蓝龙的巨魔可能会获得该生物对闪电伤害的免疫和闪电吐息行动。请注意，这可能会显著增加巨魔在战斗中的难度——特别是如果它们的变异造成的伤害超过正常水平，或者获得对酸性或火焰伤害的免疫。",
	"You can increase the difficulty and drama of a battle against trolls by having their severed body parts form limbjumbles. Whenever a troll takes 10 or more slashing damage from an attack or effect, a chunk of their body flies off and forms a limbjumble.": "通过让巨魔的断肢组成肢体混乱，可以增加与巨魔战斗的难度和戏剧性。每当一只巨魔受到来自攻击或效果的10点或更多斩击伤害时，他们的一部分身体会飞出并形成一个肢体混乱。",
	"Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something other than a mortal. No matter the reason for their creation, all undead were once living creatures who walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.": "有些作为无意识的士兵和工人，受着一位死灵法师的控制。其他人在受到诅咒魔法影响的地方经历痛苦死亡后复活。对于少数人来说，成为不朽之物是一个选择，而不是凡人。无论是因为什么原因而被创造出来，所有的不死生物都曾是活着的生物，在死后违抗自然秩序地在大地上行走。",
	"{@b {@i Stuff of Nightmares.}} Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people's fear of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.": "{@b {@i Stuff of Nightmares.}} 腐烂的僵尸，诱惑的吸血鬼，哀嚎的幽灵等不死生物在广为流传的恐怖故事中徘徊，贵族和平民们在微弱的炉火旁相互讲述这些故事。即使是最孤僻的隐士也知道死者可能会复活，渴望杀戮。这些流行的传说助长了许多人对不死生物的恐惧。仅仅是关于附近食尸鬼群的谣言就足以让整个社区陷入恐慌。当教堂墓地出现开口的坟墓，或者在街上发现透明的幽灵时，当地领袖会迅速雇佣冒险者来处理这一威胁。",
	"Given all the murder and anguish that has occurred at the rotting hands of the undead, their wicked reputation is well earned. But there are some honorable and kind mages who practice necromancy. They see the often-taboo school of magic as a tool that helps preserve resources and could be the key to unlocking eternal life.": "在不死族腐烂的手中发生的所有谋杀和痛苦，他们邪恶的名声是当之无愧的。但也有一些尊贵善良的法师练习死灵魔法。他们将这种常常被视为禁忌的魔法学派视为一种帮助保存资源并可能是实现永生的关键工具。",
	"{@b {@i Dark Places.}} For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While it is rarely harmful to them, the sun's golden rays make them uncomfortable and seems to shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for the fearful eyes of mortals to spot an undead. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can better stalk their victims.": "{@b {@i Dark Places.}} 对许多不死族来说，阳光是一个他们自然回避的麻烦。虽然它很少对他们造成伤害，但太阳金色的光芒让他们感到不舒服，似乎对他们死去的眼睛来说太过明亮。在白天行走也会让那些恐惧的凡人更容易发现不死族。许多不死族完全避开阳光，躲藏在墓穴或废墟中，直到夜幕降临，他们才能更好地潜伏猎物。",
	"{@b {@i Encountered Together.}} Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and wights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. Because undead don't need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe and many share an affinity for lightless places, they often gather together.": "{@b {@i Encountered Together.}} 不死族经常以包括不止一种生物的群体形式出现。一个死灵法师可能会召唤僵尸、骷髅和食尸鬼来保护他们的庄园，因为每种不死生物都有不同的守护功能。一位巫妖可能会让幽灵充当信使，让尸妖充当实验室助手。一个古老的墓穴里可能会有木乃伊和吸血鬼。因为不死族不需要喝水、吃东西、睡觉或呼吸，而且许多不死族都喜欢黑暗的地方，它们经常聚集在一起。",
	"This book presents a lot of the Undead creatures together in one section because most GMs tend to use ghouls, skeletons, vampires, zombies, and the like together in the same encounters. By keeping these Undead together, it makes for less page flipping or PDF scrolling for the GM when running an encounter.": "这本书将许多不死族生物放在一个部分中，因为大多数GMs倾向于在同一场遭遇中一起使用尸食鬼、骷髅、吸血鬼、僵尸等。将这些不死族放在一起，可以减少GM在进行遭遇时翻页或滚动PDF的次数。",
	"These aren't your regular ghosts. They cling to this world, determined to take as many of the living with them as possible before they're destroyed.": "这些不是你平常的鬼魂。他们紧紧抓住这个世界，决心在被摧毁之前带走尽可能多的活着的人。",
	"Shadows. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be formed by a person's vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer's dark art. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, spectral undead are malice incarnate.": "阴影。幽灵。幽灵。幽灵不死者有许多形式。一个可能是由一个人在生前邪恶的行为形成的，而另一个可能是一个灵魂迷失在一个死灵术士的黑暗艺术中。强大的不死者甚至可以通过意志力将这些阴影生物显现出来。无论它们是如何形成的，幽灵不死者都是恶意的化身。",
	"{@b {@i What They Can't Have.}} All spectral undead yearn for something only the living can provide. Specters and their lesser kindred, shades, vaguely remember their lives—and they're murderously envious of those who haven't lost theirs. Shadows want to drain living things of physical warmth and vitality (and the less tainted by evil their quarry is, the better). Meanwhile, wraiths greedily devour the living to taste their life essence.": "{@b {@i What They Can't Have.}} 所有光谱不死族都渴望着只有活着的人才能提供的东西。幽灵及其较低级的同类，阴影，模糊地记得他们的生活 - 并且他们对那些没有失去生命的人充满了嫉妒和杀意。阴影想要吸取活物的身体温暖和活力（而且他们的猎物越不被邪恶污染，越好）。与此同时，怨灵贪婪地吞食活人，品尝他们的生命精华。",
	"{@b {@i Drawn to the Living.}} Spectral undead who naturally formed from the souls of malicious, hate-filled humanoids usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being serve their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to slaughter living creatures they encounter. Some even leave the places they haunt to stalk their quarry over miles of wilderness.": "{@b {@i Drawn to the Living.}} 幽灵不死生物是由恶毒、充满仇恨的人型生物的灵魂自然形成的，通常出现在它们死亡的地方，而被其他生物所显现的幽灵不死生物会侍奉它们的创造者。如果被任由，幽灵不死生物会不惜一切地屠杀它们遇到的生物。有些甚至会离开它们所出没的地方，在数英里的荒野中追踪猎物。",
	"Once a humble historian and archaeologist, Kiona Duemois stumbled across the {@item Codex Mortis|SaF}, a powerful tome of necromancy, in her travels. It changed her life forever—and ended it.": "曾经是一位谦逊的历史学家和考古学家，Kiona Duemois 在她的旅行中偶然发现了{@item Codex Mortis|SaF}，一本强大的死灵魔法书。它彻底改变了她的生活——也结束了她的生命。",
	"She spent months poring over her discovery, attempting to decipher the book's archaic passages. At first, she only meant to study the tome and record notes on her findings . . . but the codex called to her. Enthralled, Kiona convinced herself that she should just perform one of the book's smaller incantations for posterity. That one spell destroyed her earthly form and turned her ragged soul into a twisted, shadowy abomination of dark power.": "她花了数月时间钻研她的发现，试图解读这本书中古老的段落。起初，她只是想研究这本书并记录她的发现的笔记……但这本法典在召唤她。被迷住了，Kiona 说服自己应该为后人执行这本书中的一个小咒语。那个咒语摧毁了她的肉体，将她破碎的灵魂变成了一个扭曲的、阴暗力量的阴影畸形体。",
	"The {@item Codex Mortis|SaF} mysteriously disappeared shortly after Kiona's death. In her new form, she set out to amass more power. The once genial archaeologist thirsts for the life of the living and yearns to hold the {@item Codex Mortis|SaF} once more. To those ends, she has built an army of spectral undead who carry out her every desire.": "在Kiona的死后不久，{@item Codex Mortis|SaF}神秘地消失了。在她的新形态中，她开始积聚更多的力量。这位曾经和蔼可亲的考古学家渴望着活人的生命，并渴望再次拥有{@item Codex Mortis|SaF}。为了达到这些目的，她建立了一支幽灵亡灵军团，执行她的每一个愿望。",
	"You can find out more about the {@item Codex Mortis|SaF} in {@book Strongholds & Followers|SaF}.": "你可以在{@book Strongholds & Followers|SaF}了解更多关于{@item Codex Mortis|SaF}的信息。",
	"Though most incorporeal undead were once Humanoid, you can easily make spectral undead from any other creature type. First, choose the stat block you want to use for the undead: shade, shadow, specter, or wraith. Then adjust the stat block's size and Intelligence score to match the original creature's statistics. That's all you need to do to make an incorporeal undead version of a creature.": "虽然大多数无实体的不死生物曾经是人形生物，但你可以轻松地从任何其他生物类型制作幽灵不死生物。首先，选择你想要用于不死生物的属性块：阴影（shade）、暗影（shadow）、幽灵（specter）或怨灵（wraith）。然后调整属性块的体型和智力得分，以匹配原始生物的统计数据。这就是制作一个生物的无实体不死版本所需做的一切。",
	"I dunno why it's always wraiths. Dealt with a lot of deathless, but wraiths are the worst. They're always pissed about something.": "我不知道为什么总是鬼魂。处理过很多不死族，但鬼魂是最糟糕的。他们总是对某事很生气。",
	"At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, wights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Most lack a soul, and many can't think beyond the orders of their creators (unlike more powerful corporeal undead, such as liches and vampires). Those who aren't controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.": "在最无害的情况下，肉体不死者是对生命的嘲弄，是被不自然的线牵引着的身体。在最糟糕的情况下，它们是渴望屠杀的暴力灾害，是对凡人渴望永生的扭曲反映。食尸鬼、骷髅、尸鬼和僵尸都是较低级别的肉体不死者。大多数缺乏灵魂，许多无法超越创造者的命令思考（不像更强大的肉体不死者，如巫妖和吸血鬼）。那些没有被他人控制的人通常只有一个目标：摧毁所有生物。",
	"{@b {@i Halted Processes.}} The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. These spells also halt decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration when magic touched them. Some experienced necromancers can even reverse a corpse's decay, making an undead appear living at a glance.": "{@b {@i Halted Processes.}} 使尸体复活的魔法消除了对空气、睡眠和食物的需求。这些法术还可以停止腐烂，保持不死生物在被魔法触摸时的腐烂阶段。一些经验丰富的死灵法师甚至可以逆转尸体的腐烂，使不死生物一瞥之间看起来像是活着的。",
	"{@b {@i Eternal Service.}} Most corporeal undead are created and controlled by a mage. Some guard libraries, laboratories, or treasures, while others perform menial labor. But the truly fearful undead are the soldiers in rotted armies, ready to conquer for their creator. These warriors never tire or complain. They have no need for food or drink. They exist only to lay waste.": "{@b {@i Eternal Service.}} 大多数有形不死生物是由法师创造和控制的。 有些守护图书馆、实验室或宝藏，而其他一些从事苦力劳动。 但真正可怕的不死战士是腐烂军队中的士兵，他们随时准备为他们的创造者征服。 这些战士永不疲倦，也不抱怨。 他们不需要食物或饮料。 他们的存在只为毁灭。",
	"When their mortal creators die, the undead unceasingly carry out their last orders. Some guard ruined towers for eternity while others search forests for long-escaped quarry. Should these final orders ever be fulfilled, most undead without a commander resort to killing any mortals they come across.": "当它们的凡人创造者死去时，不死者会不断执行他们的最后命令。有些守护着废墟中的塔楼直到永远，而另一些则在森林中寻找已经逃脱很久的猎物。如果这些最后命令曾经被履行，大多数没有指挥官的不死者会转而杀死他们遇到的任何凡人。",
	"{@b {@i Deriding Awareness.}} Some corporeal undead, such as ghouls and wights, come to being with awareness and full autonomy, even if the undead is at the command of another. However, these undead typically retain no memory or personality from their mortal life, and they act on desires instilled in them from their creator.": "{@b {@i Deriding Awareness.}} 一些有形的不死生物，比如食尸鬼和尸妖，在被召唤时会拥有意识和完全的自主权，即使这些不死生物听命于他人。然而，这些不死生物通常不会保留来自凡人生活的记忆或个性，他们会按照创造者灌输的欲望行动。",
	"{@b {@i Unique Risings.}} While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, there are tales of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astrological occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy. Some sages theorize that any place tainted with abundant evil could gradually animate a corpse with foul magic.": "{@b {@i Unique Risings.}}虽然大多数有形不死生物是由创造者复活的，但也有传说说到在罕见的天文事件中，尸体会突然从墓地中升起，骷髅士兵会在他们死亡周年纪念日从大规模坟墓中出现，以及其他看似自发的死灵魔法行为。一些贤者推测，任何被大量邪恶污染的地方都可能逐渐用邪恶魔法使尸体复活。",
	"Crawling claws are severed hands animated by fell spells. The magic that granted them unlife also turns their fingernails into filth-covered blades. These tiny creatures are wickedly mischievous and make rude gestures at their opponents before attacking.": "爬行之爪是被邪恶咒语激活的截肢手。赋予它们不死之力的魔法也将它们的指甲变成了沾满污垢的利刃。这些微小生物非常恶劣，会在袭击前对对手做粗鲁的手势。",
	"Though they don't require food to exist, ghouls endlessly hunger for mortal flesh. When a ghoul comes into being, their limbs and tongue grow longer, each ending in jagged claws and barbs. Negative energy courses through these weapons, allowing the ghoul to slow their prey and tear flesh from bones.": "尽管食物对它们并非必需，食尸鬼们却无尽地渴望凡间肉体。当一个食尸鬼诞生时，它们的四肢和舌头会变得更长，每一根都尖锐如爪，布满倒钩。负能量流淌在这些武器中，让食尸鬼能够减缓猎物的速度，撕裂肉体，噬骨啃骸。",
	"Without flesh to weigh them down, skeletons are among the most agile undead. This unnatural talent makes them prized archers in most necromancers' armies—doubly so because skeletons can use their remains as ammunition infused with necrotic energy, then regrow these expended bones the next day.": "没有肉体的束缚，骷髅是最灵活的不死生物之一。这种不自然的天赋使它们成为大多数死灵法师军队中备受珍视的弓箭手——更重要的是，骷髅可以将自己的遗骸用作充满死灵能量的弹药，然后第二天重新长出这些用尽的骨骼。",
	"The most competent of the lesser corporeal undead, the sallow-skinned, red-eyed wights often protect necromancers in battle and issue orders to other undead. When given a general order (such as \"destroy the farmlands\"), they can make and execute a plan to achieve it. On top of their cunning, a wight's mere touch can drain a mortal's vitality.": "在较低级别的实体不死生物中，最有能力的是苍白皮肤、红眼睛的尸鬼，它们经常在战斗中保护死灵法师，并向其他不死生物发布命令。当接到一般性命令（比如“摧毁农田”）时，它们可以制定并执行计划来实现这个目标。除了狡诈之外，尸鬼的触碰就能夺取一个凡人的活力。",
	"The most numerous of the corporeal undead, zombies are slow, mindless corpses who are tough to kill. They require very little magic to create, so even budding necromancers usually have a few zombie bodyguards, and zombies often fill the ranks of undead armies. Powerful necromancers wield enough magic to control much bigger corpses, reanimating giants into enormous war engines.": "作为实体不死生物中最常见的一种，僵尸(zombies)行动缓慢，毫无意识，难以击杀。它们只需要很少的魔法就能被制造出来，因此即使是新手死灵法师通常也会有几个僵尸护卫，而僵尸也经常充当不死军队的一员。强大的死灵法师能够驾驭足够的魔法来控制更大的尸体，将巨人复活为巨大的战争机器。",

	"{@b {@i Forging Soulstones.}} The ritual to create a lich requires a sphere constructed of something personal to the subject, such as steel from an heirloom suit of armor or a tangle of branches from the tree that shaded their wedding.

The hearts conjoin and transmute into a ruby that welds to the sphere, creating the new lich's soulstone.": "{@b {@i Forging Soulstones.}} 制造一位巫妖的仪式需要一个由主体个人之物构建的球体，比如一套传家的铠甲中的钢铁，或是曾经为他们的婚礼提供阴凉的树枝。为了完成仪式，主体必须拔出自己的心脏和一个活着的所爱之人的心脏，将两颗心放入球体内。这两颗心会融合并转化为一颗红宝石，焊接在球体上，从而创造出新巫妖的灵魂石。",

Others embrace their terrifying look, proudly displaying their dark triumph to every creature they encounter.": "{@b {@i Terrifying Presence.}} 一位巫妖的真实外貌令人作呕。他们胸口的伤口永远无法愈合，随着世纪的流逝，他们的身体慢慢腐烂成为骷髅。一些巫妖用幻象隐藏他们的外表，使他们比生前更加迷人和有活力。另一些则接受了他们可怕的外貌，自豪地展示他们的黑暗胜利给每一个他们遇到的生物。",

Since prismacore never loses power, valok can work ceaselessly, without rest or respite.": "{@b {@i Prismacore Power.}} 钢铁矮人还开采了伊里多斯（Iridoss），通常被称为棱晶核。这种稀有宝石蕴含着其他世界的力量。与其他由咒语或祈祷驱动的构造体不同，每个瓦洛克（Valok）的棱晶核心让它们可以在没有魔法的情况下运转。由于棱晶核永不耗尽能量，瓦洛克可以不休息、不间断地工作。",
	"{@b {@i Mechanized Evolution.}} The first valok were great machines made to dig, smelt, and build. Legends say these giant walkers could build entire cities in a matter of days and could even construct other valok. As the steel dwarves learned the deep secrets of prismacore, they made machines that could speak and think more freely.": "{@b {@i Mechanized Evolution.}} 第一代瓦洛克(Valok)是伟大的机器，用于挖掘、熔炼和建造。传说这些巨大的步行者可以在几天内建造整个城市，甚至可以建造其他瓦洛克(Valok)。随着钢铁矮人学习了棱镜核心(prismacore)的深层秘密，他们制造出可以更自由地说话和思考的机器。",

	"Servoks, the labor and siege class of valok, are huge, slow, and built for a specific purpose—though all are designed to defend themselves when threatened. No humaniform servoks have been discovered; their forms depend on their purpose, but they're never smaller than a wagon. Despite each servok's utilitarian construction and the ages of grime accumulated atop their iridoss, each servok is impressive to behold.": "瓦洛克（Valok）的劳动和围攻类别，Servoks，庞大、缓慢，专为特定目的而建—尽管它们都被设计成在受到威胁时能自卫。目前尚未发现任何人形Servoks；它们的形态取决于其用途，但从未小于一辆马车。尽管每个Servok都是实用主义建筑，表面积累了年代久远的污垢，但每个Servok都令人印象深刻。",
	"The dead language of the steel dwarves is lost to time and beyond the reach of most magic, but scholars believe that someone who spoke this ancient tongue could command a servok. Even then, servoks can't act outside their design parameters—a servok designed to mine ore can't be commanded to make a vase.": "钢铁矮人的失传语言已经随着时间的流逝而消失，超出了大多数魔法的触及范围，但学者们相信，能够说这种古老语言的人可以控制一个（Servok）。即便如此，Servok也不能超出其设计参数的行动——一个被设计用来开采矿石的Servok不能被命令制作花瓶。",
	"{@b {@i Servok Builder.}} Steel dwarves used one class of servoks, called builders, to construct buildings, roads, and walls. Their valiar arms can lift and fling enormous stones, and a great mixing cannister on their back holds concrete that can be spewed forth from an opening at the front of the construct. The steel dwarves equipped each builder with a valiar wrecking ball to demolish any old construction impeding the servok's progress.": "{@b {@i Servok Builder.}} 钢铁矮人使用一种类别的伺服机器人，被称为建筑者，来建造建筑物、道路和墙壁。它们强壮的臂部可以举起和投掷巨大的石块，背上的一个巨大的混凝土搅拌罐可以从构造物前部的开口喷出混凝土。钢铁矮人为每个建筑者配备了一个瓦利亚毁坏球，用来拆除任何妨碍伺服机器人前进的旧建筑。",

	"There are still war engines that went to battle and haven't returned. They consider every creature they meet who isn't a steel dwarf to be an enemy": "仍有战争机器参加了战斗却未归来。它们认为每遇到一个不是钢铁矮人的生物都是敌人。",
	"Smaller than servoks, multivoks can speak and carry out commands, though their capacity for complexity is limited. While multivoks are humaniform, their masterfully crafted bodies lack the expression and fine articulation of humanoids. They were built to run and maintain ships and ore harvesters, survey dangerous or distant locations, guard nobles, and oversee servoks—tasks which many multivoks tirelessly attempt to continue today.": "比servoks更小，multivoks可以说话并执行命令，尽管它们的复杂性能力有限。虽然multivoks是人形的，但它们精湛制作的身体缺乏人形的表达和精细的关节。它们被建造用于运行和维护船只和矿石收割机，勘测危险或遥远的地点，保护贵族，并监督servoks—许多multivoks今天仍不知疲倦地尝试继续执行这些任务。",

They can activate a magnetic power to yank armored targets toward them and away from their charges.": "{@b {@i Multivok Bodyguard.}}手臂上装有斧头和肩膀上安装了连发弩的多沃克护卫展现出令人印象深刻的形象。他们可以激活磁力能力，将装甲目标拉向他们，并远离他们的目标。",

	"{@b {@i Multivok Chief.}} One of the most advanced multivoks, a chief directs and coordinates other valok to get work done. They were built to oversee projects in the absence of steel dwarf supervisors. Each chief wields a targeting beam that allows them to direct other valok toward enemies and objects that require destruction.": "{@b {@i Multivok Chief.}} 在最先进的多伏克中，首领指挥和协调其他瓦洛克完成工作。他们被设计用来在没有钢铁矮人监督员的情况下监督项目。每个首领都拥有一个定位光束，可以指挥其他瓦洛克朝着需要摧毁的敌人和物体前进。",
	"Active chiefs still roam the halls of the steel dwarves, organizing their fellow constructs to protect treasures, construct buildings, destroy invaders, and dig tunnels.": "活跃的首领们仍在钢铁矮人的大厅中游走，组织他们的同伴构造物来保护宝藏、建造建筑、摧毁入侵者，并挖掘隧道。",
	". . . and, eventually, machines indistinguishable from living, thinking beings—the omnivok. Originally intended as a gift to Empress Xiong, the human-seeming omnivok were never delivered. The steel dwarves made their servants too well, and they could not abide treating the machine people they'd created as slaves.": "最终，机器变得和活生生的、会思考的生物一样——万物者。最初是作为献给熊皇后的礼物，看起来像人类的万物者却从未被交付。钢铁矮人制造的仆人做得太过出色，无法忍受将他们创造的机器人当作奴隶对待。",
	"Among the most powerful psions in the timescape, synlirii (singular: synliroi) are known as the \"voiceless talkers\" to the denizens of the World Below—and to surface dwellers unfortunate enough to encounter them.

	"{@b {@i Uneasy Alliances.}} Though synlirii and overminds are hereditary enemies, their mutual obsession with the barking ones often leads to uneasy alliances. Both synlirii and overminds employ humanoids from the World Below as agents, trading lore and technology for information on their surface foes.": "{@b {@i Uneasy Alliances.}} 虽然辛利瑞 (synlirii) 和超心 (overminds) 是世仇，但它们对吠者 (barking ones) 的共同痴迷常常导致不稳定的联盟。辛利瑞和超心都雇佣来自地下世界的人形生物作为代理人，交换知识和技术以获取有关地表敌人的信息。",
	"{@b {@i Olothec Hatred.}} The synlirii's visceral antipathy toward the barking ones is surpassed only by their deep enmity toward (and fear of) olothec. Ancient myths say olothec created both synlirii and overminds. To overminds, this is a harmless fable. But synlirii, who style themselves as the future masters of the timescape, rage against implications that their powers come from any source other than their own superior development.": "{@b {@i Olothec Hatred.}} 辛利瑞对吠声者的内在厌恶仅次于他们对奥洛泰克的深仇大恨（和恐惧）。古老的神话说奥洛泰克创造了辛利瑞和超心者。对于超心者来说，这只是一个无害的寓言。但辛利瑞自称为时光之主的未来，他们对任何暗示表明他们的力量来自于除了他们自己卓越的发展之外的任何来源都感到愤怒。",

They use their psionic talents to manipulate memory and perception, obscure their forms, and pass undetected among other cultures.": "尽管无声交谈者拥有强大的心灵力量，但他们认为信息是他们最强大的武器。他们利用心灵能力操纵记忆和感知，掩盖自己的形态，在其他文化中悄然行动而不被察觉。",

	"Floating clawed brains with a trailing spinal column and nerves, mindkillers serve as the voiceless talkers' pets and lackeys. These amorphous parasites can force themselves into a humanoid's body through the ear, eye, or nose, then devour the victim's central nervous system while replacing it with their own tissue. When the process is complete, the mindkiller gains all the victim's knowledge and memories and can puppet the body, becoming the perfect spy for the mindkiller's synlirii overlords.": "悬浮的爪状大脑，带着尾部脊柱和神经，心灵杀手充当无声交谈者的宠物和走狗。这些无定形的寄生虫可以通过耳朵、眼睛或鼻子强行进入人类身体，然后吞噬受害者的中枢神经系统，用自己的组织取代它。当过程完成时，心灵杀手获得受害者的所有知识和记忆，并可以操纵身体，成为心灵杀手的synlirii霸主的完美间谍。",

	"{@b {@i Apex Cave Predator.}} The lamasombra's unnatural scales bend darkness in a way that interferes with other creatures' darkvision. In dim light, this gives creatures without darkvision an unusual advantage against the lamasombra, as those with darkvision can't see the predator except in bright light. The lamasombra's specialized bones and foot pads eliminate sound and vibrations even at blinding speeds, rendering their prey's tremorsense useless.

These plants drift through the air on gentle psionic currents, propelled by the spores they constantly release.

A deep dreamer's influence can compel creatures to become lost in their dreams, never to wake up.": "一张精细的带刺黑色丝状网络支撑着深梦者的真菌体，使它们看起来像一个巨大而邪恶的蒲公英。这些植物在轻柔的灵能气流中飘荡，被它们不断释放的孢子推动着。当其他生物做梦时，深梦者利用它们的丝状结构来吸取这些生物的精神能量。深梦者的影响力可以迫使生物迷失在梦境中，永远无法醒来。",
	"{@b {@i Drifting Dreams.}} Deep dreamers seem perpetually lost in their own reverie, and collisions with solid objects often go unnoticed.

These creatures follow their deep dreamers wherever they drift, lumbering after the fungus in a trance—and even jumping in front of the deep dreamer to save them from danger. Some of these creatures have been with their dreamers for so long that they're permanently tethered to one of the dreamer's filaments.": "{@b {@i Sinister Bonds.}} 一些深梦者无意中积累了一群永远沉浸在梦境中的生物。这些生物会跟随他们的深梦者漂泊，迷迷糊糊地跟在真菌后面，甚至会跳到深梦者面前，拯救他们免受危险。有些生物已经和他们的梦者在一起很久了，以至于永远被系在梦者的一个丝线上。",

Their diet gives them an iridescent sheen, and their bodies often reflect the colors of the crystals they feed on.": "常见于洞穴中，自然晶体生长的地方，宝石果冻分泌消化酸，分解岩石并允许它们以产生的矿物质为食。它们的饮食赋予它们一种虹彩般的光泽，它们的身体经常反射出它们所吃晶体的颜色。",

	"{@b {@i Ley Line Siphons.}} When large colonies of leyleeches gather in a single area, their feeding can destabilize or even drain a ley line completely, affecting the way magic behaves in the immediate area. When several nearby colonies feed at once, it can affect a region miles wide.": "当大量的(leyleeches)聚集在一个地区时，它们的进食可能会破坏甚至完全耗尽一条魔线，影响魔法在该区域的行为方式。当附近几个殖民地同时进食时，它可能影响数英里范围内的地区。",

These monstrous bipedal beings sport six arms, four of which end in sharp, sword-like talons. Their eyesight is poor, but they make up for it with their incredible sense of smell that allows them to track by scent alone. Marvoroks use their claws to dig into rocky surfaces and pull themselves up, climbing as easily as they run.": "马沃洛克斯（{@link marr-VORR-ock|https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Marvorok.html}）是潜伏在地底深处的阴险捕食者，不断寻找猎物来满足他们似乎无尽的饥饿。这些怪物般的两足生物有六只手臂，其中四只末端长有锋利的剑状爪子。它们的视力很差，但通过不可思议的嗅觉弥补了这一点，使它们能够凭气味追踪猎物。马沃洛克斯使用它们的爪子挖进岩石表面并拉扯自己，像奔跑一样轻松地攀爬。",

	"There are two typical setups for deep dreamer encounters. The first is a deep dreamer with a bevy of creatures charmed by the fungus who fight to protect the dreamer. The other is a lone dreamer floating in the darkness above the characters, releasing spores in an attempt to charm them before any fighting begins.": "深梦者遭遇通常有两种典型设置。第一种是深梦者身边有一群被真菌魅惑的生物，它们会为了保护深梦者而战斗。另一种是一个孤独的梦者漂浮在角色们上方的黑暗中，释放孢子试图在战斗开始之前将他们魅惑。",

	"All the parties in this section are explicitly villains. These characters aren't neutral mercenaries who can be negotiated with and possibly recruited. They're remorseless people who want to do bad—sometimes deeply awful—things. And in many cases, they do these things with glee. These are horrible people.": "这一部分中的所有派系都是明确的恶棍。这些角色不是中立的雇佣兵，不能通过谈判并有可能招募他们。他们是无情的人，想要做坏事——有时是非常可怕的事情。在许多情况下，他们做这些事情时还会感到愉悦。这些都是可怕的人。",
	"We believe that the more explicitly evil your villains are, the more motivated many players are to fight them—and the more triumphant players feel when their heroes win. But this is just a matter of taste, and many GMs and players aren't interested in that kind of fantasy. They might prefer a more relatable or comedic villain, or they might prefer adventures where the heroes are pitted against nature (although this book will be of little use in that event). We like those things too!": "我们相信，角色扮演游戏中的反派越是明确地邪恶，许多玩家就越有动力去与他们战斗——当他们的英雄取得胜利时，玩家们也会感到更加得意。但这只是一种口味问题，许多主持人和玩家对这种幻想并不感兴趣。他们可能更喜欢一个更具亲和力或滑稽的反派，或者他们可能更喜欢英雄们与自然对抗的冒险（尽管在这种情况下，这本书将没有什么用处）。我们也喜欢这些事情！",
	"The creatures in this book all conform to a certain tone of realism and plausibility filtered through the lens of drama. But it's difficult for even this mighty tome to compete with real-world villainy in terms of sheer horrific evil—and some players don't want their games to compete like that. It's essential to know your table, talk to your players, and get a sense of what kinds of drama they enjoy and engage with. If you read these entries and find a villain's motives or methods too awful for your table, you have the option to reskin them, keeping their statistics and changing their fiction. We recommend using safety tools, like the ones found in the free MCDM Tabletop Safety Toolkit, to facilitate clear and concise communication with your players about anything that makes them or you uncomfortable.": "这本书中的生物都符合一定的现实主义和可信度，通过戏剧的镜头进行过滤。但即使是这本强大的巨著也很难与现实世界的邪恶相竞争，因为那种邪恶是如此的可怕和恐怖。有些玩家不希望他们的游戏变得如此竞争。了解你的游戏桌、与玩家交流，并了解他们喜欢和参与的戏剧类型是至关重要的。如果你阅读这些条目并发现某个反派的动机或方法对你的游戏桌来说太可怕了，你可以选择重新设计它们，保留它们的统计数据并改变它们的故事。我们建议使用安全工具，比如免费的MCDM桌面安全工具包中的工具，以便与玩家就任何让他们或你感到不舒服的事情进行清晰简洁的沟通。",
	"This book took care of designing, testing, and balancing the powers and features of these villains. The way you use them now is up to you.

	"Each party's section presents their villain actions in a recommended order for dramatic effect, often saving the most devastating for last. Odds are that you won't use every villain party action in a single encounter, as some creatures will be defeated before they get to use their action. That's okay! If every villain action were used in an encounter, it would be deadly indeed.": "每个派对的部分按照建议的顺序展示他们的反派行动，通常将最具破坏性的行动留到最后。很可能你不会在单次遭遇中使用每个反派行动，因为有些生物可能会在他们使用行动之前被击败。这没关系！如果每个反派行动都在一次遭遇中使用，那将会非常致命。",

The more information they gain and plans they foil, the better!": "那么你应该让角色与（the villain party）的手下互动。他们甚至可能与该派对的一两名成员交锋，或者从远处看到他们。给予角色充分的机会破坏该派对的一个或多个阴谋，并了解每个恶棍。他们获得的信息越多，挫败的计划越多，就越好！",
	"Eventually, after enough foiled plans at the hands of the characters, the villain party should strike back. This could be the moment of the final showdown if you're running a shorter game, or you could have the villain party hit the characters where it hurts. Just like the characters might be researching the villains, the evildoers look into the heroes. The villain party might raze a location important to the characters, harm or kidnap one of their NPC allies, or destroy or steal an object of great personal importance.

While most groups have at least a few characters with far-reaching spells and weapons, there are some that may find it frustrating if Sair just keeps attacking from an unreachable position. If you're running the Abominations against a group that is mostly focused on melee and short-range attacks, give them a fighting chance and have Sair stay closer to the ground.": "Sair（赛尔）的飞行速度与其超能力箭攻击的射程达到120英尺，这意味着他们永远不需要与角色进行近战。虽然大多数团队至少有几个角色拥有远程法术和武器，但有些团队可能会发现，如果Sair只是从无法接触的位置进行攻击，这可能会让他们感到沮丧。如果你正在对抗一个主要专注于近战和短程攻击的团队，给他们一些战斗机会，让Sair保持在地面附近。",

Some players may be eager to take down these bigots, while for others, the injustice might hit too close to reality.

In his warped, evil mind, people who openly speak of equal justice and liberty for all are just pandering to fashion; privately, all wise people surely know this is an Age of Men. Erasmus is so enamored with his own misguided ideals that he doesn't notice how most people barely hide their disgust for him—some out of politeness, others out of fear of the lord's power.": "除了神秘的契约创始人外，埃拉斯莫斯是最资深的成员。他喜欢团结友爱，并已将自己团结在志同道合的人身边。在他看来，契约的邪恶理念很受欢迎。即使在有礼貌的场合，他也会公开发表他的偏执观点。虽然房间里通常会分成那些公开赞同和那些保持沉默的人，但他确信即使后者也同意他——因为谁会反对对他来说如此明显的“事实”呢？在他扭曲邪恶的思想中，那些公开谈论平等正义和自由的人只是在迎合潮流；私下里，所有明智的人肯定都知道这是一个男人的时代。埃拉斯莫斯如此迷恋自己错误的理念，以至于他没有注意到大多数人几乎都在掩饰对他的厌恶——有些人是出于礼貌，有些人是出于对主人权力的恐惧。",
