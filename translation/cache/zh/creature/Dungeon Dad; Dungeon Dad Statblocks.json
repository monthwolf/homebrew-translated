	"Star Seekers. Moon giants dwell in rocky badlands and other scarred, deserted places. Some say there are even moon giant populations that live on the various moons of the multiverse. Whether this is true or not, it seems likely as even the giants themselves claim to have once come from the moon. They revere the moon, stars, and comets, often seeking wisdom in the movement of these celestial bodies. Their entire culture is built atop the knowledge and whispered secrets they have glimpsed in the great beyond.": "星空探寻者。 月巨人居住在多石的荒地和其他受伤的荒凉之地。 有人说，甚至有一些月巨人种群生活在多元宇宙的各种卫星上。 无论这是否属实，似乎很可能，因为就连巨人们自己也声称曾经来自月球。 他们崇敬月亮、星星和彗星，常常在这些天体的运动中寻求智慧。 他们的整个文化建立在他们在无尽宇宙中瞥见的知识和低语的秘密之上。",
	"Bad Moon Rising. Though they are normally placid scholars, more likely to enter a lively philosophical debate with other creatures than a brawl, moon giants can become violent when disturbed or when under the influence of a bad moon. There is something truly powerful about their connection to the moon and its cycles, and much is still unknown about how these complex systems directly affect the giants attuned with them.": "恶月升起。尽管它们通常是温和的学者，更有可能与其他生物进行生动的哲学辩论而不是争斗，但当被打扰或受到恶月的影响时，月巨人可能会变得暴力。它们与月亮及其周期的联系确实非常强大，关于这些复杂系统如何直接影响与它们共振的巨人仍有许多未知之处。",
	"Great Dreamers. Part of the moon giant way of life involves the undertaking of spiritual journeys while in the realm of dreamspace. They often use magic to induce sleep in themselves for long periods of time, during which they are able to travel to the plane of dreams and explore many strange places. These journeys are usually aided by clerics of the moon giant faith, and in some cases can last decades.": "伟大的梦想家。 月亮巨人生活方式的一部分涉及在梦境空间中进行精神旅程。 他们经常使用魔法让自己长时间进入睡眠状态，期间能够前往梦境平面并探索许多奇异的地方。 这些旅程通常由月亮巨人信仰的神职人员协助，并在某些情况下可以持续数十年。",
	"Cosmic Nature. Moon giants don't need to breathe.": "宇宙自然。月球巨人不需要呼吸。",
	"The moon giant constantly emits a lunar aura with a radius of 60 feet in all directions centred on it. The aura has two possible effects, however, only one can be active at a time. The giant can use a bonus action at the start of each turn to change the effect of its aura among the following two options;": "月亮巨人不断散发着以自身为中心，半径60英尺的月之光环。该光环有两种可能的效果，但每次只能激活其中一种。巨人可以在每个回合开始时使用一个奖励动作来在以下两个选项中切换光环的效果；",
	"Affected creatures are calmed. They cannot be {@condition charmed} or {@condition frightened}, and become indifferent about creatures that they are hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When a creature is no longer affected by the aura, the creature becomes hostile again unless the GM rules otherwise.": "受影响的生物被平静下来。它们不能被{@condition charmed}或{@condition frightened}，并对它们敌对的生物变得漠不关心。如果目标受到攻击或法术伤害，或目睹其朋友受到伤害，这种漠不关心会结束。当生物不再受到光环影响时，除非GM另有规定，否则生物会再次变得敌对。",
	"Affected creatures are enraged. They get advantage on strength checks and attack rolls and may add {@dice 1d6} to any damage roll they make as part of an attack or the casting of a spell. Any creature that attacks an enraged creature also has advantage on their attack roll. A lycanthrope that fails its save is forced into its hybrid form.": "受影响的生物变得愤怒。它们在力量检定和攻击检定上获得优势，并可以在进行攻击或施放法术时，将其造成的任何伤害骰增加{@dice 1d6}。任何攻击愤怒生物的生物也获得对其攻击检定的优势。一个失去豺狼病的豺狼人将被迫进入其混合形态。",
	"The giant can choose whether it is affected by its own aura or not. All creatures who enter the area for the first time on a turn or start their turn there must make a {@dc 18} Wisdom saving throw or be effected by the aura.": "巨人可以选择是否受到自己光环的影响。所有在一个回合内第一次进入该区域或者在那里开始他们的回合的生物必须进行一次{@dc 18}感知豁免检定，否则会受到光环的影响。",
	"When a moon giant throws a rock, it permanently creates an area of difficult terrain in a 10 foot radius around the spot where the rock landed. If the rock was thrown at a creature, the giant can choose the point of origin for this radius anywhere within the target's space. If the giant misses with a rock attack, the GM chooses a space within 10 feet of the target for the impact crater to appear.": "当一个月亮巨人投掷一块岩石时，它会永久地在岩石着陆点周围的10英尺半径内产生一片艰难地形区域。如果岩石被投向一个生物，巨人可以选择这个半径的起点，可以在目标的空间内的任何地方。如果巨人用岩石攻击未命中，GM会选择一个距离目标10英尺内的空间，让撞击坑出现。",

	"The monster's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save {@dc 18}, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:": "怪物的天生施法能力是智力（法术豁免 {@dc 18}，法术攻击命中加值+10）。它可以天生施放以下法术，无需材料组件：",
	"MOONRAT": "月鼠(MOONRAT)",
	"Moonrats are indistinguishable from normal rats unless in moonlight. Lunar light": "除非在月光下，否则月鼠和普通老鼠无法区分。 (Lunar light)",

On nights when the moon shines, they pour out of their darkened lairs to soak up the pallid rays and spread terror throughout humanoid settlements.": "对这些生物产生了潜在的影响，使它们变得比任何老鼠都更聪明、更强壮、更凶猛。在月光照耀的夜晚，它们从黑暗的巢穴中涌出，吸收苍白的光芒，在人类定居点散播恐怖。",
	"Waning Strategos. Moonrats fight just like normal rats do, biting and tearing with their teeth. Under the influence of lunar light, moonrats also gain the ability to organize, converse with one another, formulate complex plans, and operate complicated devices. Their leaders remember things done and learned nights or even months before. When the moon's light is at its peak, moonrats are capable of making and acting on long-range plans that may require dozens of full-moon nights to complete. These schemes are often so subtle and involved that casual observers do not connect incidents relating to a well conceived moonrat plan until it is too late to stop it.": "衰落军师。月鼠们的战斗方式与普通老鼠一样，用牙齿咬和撕咬。在月光的影响下，月鼠们还能够获得组织能力，彼此交流，制定复杂计划，并操作复杂装置的能力。它们的领袖能够记得数月甚至数月前所做和所学的事情。当月光达到顶峰时，月鼠们能够制定并执行需要数十个满月夜才能完成的长期计划。这些计划通常是如此微妙和复杂，以至于一般观察者直到为时已晚才能将与精心策划的月鼠计划相关的事件联系起来。",
	"Well Equipped. Moonrats are entirely capable of using weapons and equipment during their bouts of intelligence as long as said weapons and equipment are of an appropriate size. They often keep such equipment locked away so they do not mistakenly destroy it during phases of the moon which cause their intelligence to wane.": "装备精良。 月鼠们在智力高涨时完全能够使用武器和装备，只要这些武器和装备的尺寸合适。他们经常将这些装备锁起来，以免在月相导致智力减退时误用而破坏。",
	"The moon rat has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the moon rat's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't {@condition incapacitated}.": "如果至少有一只月鼠的盟友在离生物5英尺以内且该盟友不是{@condition incapacitated}，月鼠在对该生物进行攻击投掷时具有优势。",
	"The moonrat's Intelligence score is determined by the current phase of the moon. During a new moon, they have the same level of intelligence as a typical rat, however, during a full moon they are as intelligent as your average human. They also get a bonus to attack and damage rolls based on the moon's current phase. Consult the table below to determine the moonrat's current Intelligence score and its bonus to attack and damage rolls. Moonrats can speak a simple and guttural version of Common that becomes more eloquent as their Intelligence increases.": "月鼠的智力得分由月相决定。在新月期间，它们的智力水平与典型老鼠相同，然而在满月期间，它们的智力水平与普通人类相当。它们还会根据月相获得攻击和伤害骰的奖励。请参考下表以确定月鼠当前的智力得分以及它的攻击和伤害骰奖励。月鼠可以说一种简单而粗糙的普通话版本，随着它们的智力增加，变得更加雄辩。\n\n| 月相      | 智力得分 | 攻击和伤害骰奖励 |\n|-----------|---------|----------------|\n| 新月      | (%num%)  | +0             |\n| 上弦月    | (%num%)  | +1             |\n| 满月      | (%num%)  | +2             |\n| 下弦月    | (%num%)  | +1             |",

	"When the gray philosopher dies, it unleashes a resounding cry that affects all creatures within 120 feet of it that can hear. Affected creatures must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or be cursed by the gray philosopher. A Creature cursed in this way can't shake the feeling that the philosopher's contemplations must have been worthwhile, and slowly becomes obsessed with trying to understand an eldritch and unexplainable truth. The cursed creature's movement speed is reduced by half, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks not related to Intelligence. If the cursed creature dies, it rises in the spot it was killed {@dice 1d4} days later as a gray philosopher.": "当灰色哲学家死亡时，它会发出一声响亮的哭声，影响到120英尺范围内所有能听到的生物。受影响的生物必须成功通过一次{@dc 14}感知豁免才能免受灰色哲学家的诅咒。以这种方式被诅咒的生物无法摆脱哲学家的思考似乎是有价值的感觉，并逐渐变得痴迷于试图理解一种神秘而无法解释的真理。被诅咒的生物移动速度减半，并且在与智力无关的攻击检定和技能检定中具有劣势。如果被诅咒的生物死亡，它将在{@dice 1d4}天后以灰色哲学家的形式在被杀死的地点复活。",

	"The Burning Swarm. Individually, the elemental creatures that make up a cinder swarm are no more significant than a fleck of hot ash you might see snap out of a campfire. Collectively, these tiny beings gather intro towering infernos bent on incinerating anything and everything around them. While the beings that make up a cinder swarm are somewhat intelligent, the swarm moves on primarily on instinct. Like a shiver of sharks following the scent of fresh blood, a cinder swarm is easily whipped into a frenzy by the idea of setting fire to their surroundings.": "燃烧虫群。单独来看，组成火焰虫群的元素生物并不比你在篝火中看到的一小片热灰更重要。但是，这些微小的生物聚集在一起，形成高耸的烈焰，旨在将周围的一切烧毁。虽然组成火焰虫群的生物有些智能，但虫群主要凭本能移动。就像一群鲨鱼跟随着新鲜血腥气味一样，火焰虫群很容易被点燃周围环境的想法激起狂热。",
	"Pyromaniacal. Nothing excites the individuals of a cinder swarm quite like burning something, or someone, into ash. This makes cinder swarms especially dangerous and hostile to non-elemental beings who seek to communicate with them for one reason or another. Crafty pyromancers who command fire magic have, on occasion, been able to convince swarms of cinder elementals to aid them in their schemes by promising the swarm access to the material plane where there is plenty of flammable material.": "燃烧狂。在火炭群体中，没有什么能像将某物或某人烧成灰烬那样激起个体的兴奋。这使得火炭群体对那些试图以某种原因与它们沟通的非元素生物特别危险和敌对。精明的火法师们有时能够通过承诺让火炭元素群体进入有大量易燃材料的物质平面，说服火炭元素群体协助他们的计划。",
	"Trinket Prisons. In many places throughout the multiverse, particularly in the astral sea, cinder elementals are used on an individual basis as a light source.

	"The Gift That Keeps Giving. Plush golems are every parent's worst nightmare. They are typically given as gifts to young children, usually by obnoxious aunts or uncles. Plush golems seem like ordinary stuffed animals at first to most, but eventually reveal their animated state of being to the children who own them. As most children tend to treat their toy animals more like live creatures than playthings, it can become extremely frustrating for some parents as the child insists that the toy be allowed to eat at the dinner table, go along on outings, and take part in other family activities.": "持续给予的礼物。毛绒魔像是每个家长的噩梦。它们通常被讨厌的姨妈或叔叔送给年幼的孩子作为礼物。对大多数人来说，毛绒魔像起初看起来像普通的填充动物，但最终会向拥有它们的孩子展示它们的有生命状态。由于大多数孩子倾向于把他们的玩具动物当作活物而不是玩物来对待，对一些家长来说可能会变得非常令人沮丧，因为孩子坚持要求让玩具在餐桌上吃饭，参加外出活动，并参与其他家庭活动。",
	"Artisanal Playthings. Plush golems are finely crafted stuffed animals and may be formed from velvet, cotton, or wool.

	"Fierce Guardians. While they are built to be soft and friendly, if the owner of a plush golem is ever threatened, the creature will spring into action and fight mercilessly to defend its master. Plush golems are often an unforeseen line of defense against would-be burglars, kidnappers, or other criminals. This makes them an ideal companion for children born into noble houses as they provide more protection than a mere bodyguard, and are often underestimated as simple toys.": "凶猛守护者。虽然它们被制造成柔软友好的样子，但如果绒毛魔像的主人受到威胁，这个生物将会立即行动，无情地战斗以保卫主人。绒毛魔像通常是一种意想不到的防线，用来抵御潜在的入室盗贼、绑架者或其他罪犯。这使它们成为出生在贵族家庭的孩子的理想伴侣，因为它们提供的保护比单纯的保镖更多，而且常常被低估为简单的玩具。",

	"RAGGAMOFFYN": "拉加莫菲恩 (RAGGAMOFFYN)",

	"Spontaneous Arcana. Unlike other constructs, a raggamoffyn is not the result of any deliberate act of creation. Rather, it is formed when leftover magical energy interacts with inanimate objects.

Many scholars theorize that there is an element of the raggamoffyn genesis we simply have no means of understanding, yet.": "自发奥术。与其他构造物不同，一个拉加莫芬((raggamoffyn))并非源自任何刻意的创造行为。相反，它是由剩余的魔法能量与无生命的物体相互作用形成的。确切的过程并不为人所了解，大多数试图重新创造它的尝试似乎都以失败告终。许多学者推测，拉加莫芬的起源中存在一种我们目前无法理解的元素。",
	"Parasitic Fashion. Raggamoffyns, above all else, seek to acquire a host they can dominate and bend to their will. It is through controlling others that they are able to further their schemes. Often the will of a raggamoffyn will lead to a captured host getting into varying degrees of trouble, only for the raggamoffyn to flee when things go bad leaving the victim to take any blame.

	"YELLOW DRAGONS": "黄龙(Yellow Dragons)",
	"Selfish and cunning, yellow dragons hold dominion over seaside cliffs, salt flats, and coastal marshes. They are secretive and elusive in the extreme, opting to take a clever and subtle approach to problem solving rather than relying solely on draconic might. A yellow dragon is easily recognized by its elongated narrow jaws, oversized claws, and its slender body. Yellow dragons vary in color from brilliant hues of sunny yellow to flaxen shades of wheat. Their scales are much smaller than that of a typical dragon and are constantly being replaced, giving their skin a texture more akin to a snake than a lizard. This smooth scale pattern also allows them to more easily navigate through water and dirt.": "自私且狡猾，黄龙统治着海边悬崖、盐滩和沿海沼泽。它们极度隐秘和难以捉摸，更倾向于采取聪明而微妙的方式解决问题，而不是仅仅依靠龙族的力量。黄龙的长窄下颚、超大爪子和纤细身躯使其易于辨认。黄龙的颜色从明亮的阳光黄到亚麻色的小麦色不等。它们的鳞片比一般龙类要小得多，并且不断更换，使它们的皮肤质地更像蛇而不是蜥蜴。这种光滑的鳞片图案也使它们更容易在水和泥土中穿行。",
	"The Missing Dragons. Ancient lore holds true that all the chromatic dragons were born from Tiamat, the queen of dragons. The more common varieties of chromatic dragon (white, black, red, green, and blue) were all made in the image of their mother, who has a draconic head of each color. However, there are other varieties of chromatic dragon that have a more mysterious origin. Purple, orange, and yellow dragons did not originate from Tiamat, but they certainly do exist. This quandary has divided scholars for ages, but there are two prevalent theories about their origin. Some think Tiamat may have experimented with her children before unleashing them upon the world, trying to create even stronger breeds. Secondary-color crossbreeds could have bred true with each other, starting new branches of the dragon family tree. Sages also speculate as to the possibility of another chromatic dragon deity, Tiamat's sister perhaps, arrayed with heads of yellow, orange, purple, and other crossbred colors. Tiamat may have destroyed her sibling eons ago, but not before the creation of dragons in the image of their deceased progenitor.": "失踪的龙。古老传说确实如此，所有五彩龙都是由龙之女王提阿玛特生下的。常见的五彩龙（白、黑、红、绿和蓝）都是按照她们的母亲形象创造的，她有五种颜色的龙头。然而，还有其他一些五彩龙的品种具有更神秘的起源。紫色、橙色和黄色的龙并非源自提阿玛特，但它们确实存在。这个难题已经分裂了学者们很长时间，但关于它们起源有两种主流理论。一些人认为提阿玛特可能在释放它们到世界上之前对她的孩子们进行了实验，试图创造更强大的品种。次要颜色的杂交品种可能会相互繁殖，开辟龙族家族的新分支。学者们还推测可能存在另一个五彩龙神，也许是提阿玛特的姐妹，拥有黄色、橙色、紫色和其他杂交颜色的头。提阿玛特可能在无数年前摧毁了她的姐妹，但在创造出与已故祖先形象相似的龙之前。",
	"Selfish. Yellow dragons are incredibly selfish, even by the standards of other chromatic dragons. Many scholars believe the primary reason they have become so obscure is due to the fact that during the war waged by dragons against the giants, the yellow dragons offered no help. In fact, yellow dragons were said to remove themselves from the conflict entirely, not willing to risk their lives for the benefit of their kind. This led to them being reviled by other dragons and ultimately to the destruction of many yellow dragon lands. To this day, the yellow dragons keep to themselves, knowing that should they ever make their presence known they will be surrounded by enemies.": "自私。黄龙（Yellow dragons）极其自私，即使按其他五彩龙（chromatic dragons）的标准来看也是如此。许多学者认为它们变得如此默默无闻的主要原因是因为在龙族对抗巨人的战争中，黄龙没有提供任何帮助。事实上，据说黄龙完全脱离了冲突，不愿为了同类的利益而冒生命危险。这导致其他龙对它们感到厌恶，最终导致许多黄龙的领地被摧毁。直到今天，黄龙独来独往，知道一旦它们暴露自己，就会被敌人包围。",
	"Cunning Trappers. Unlike most other dragons, even in their oldest stages of life, the yellow dragon prefers to use ambush tactics and traps when engaging in battle. They are not as physically powerful as some of their other draconic cousins, but yellow dragons are extremely fast and capable of traveling through water, sand, and rock with relative ease. They use this unique mobility to their utmost advantage and will only ever take a fight they know will end in victory. A favorite trap of theirs is to dig a cone-shaped pit with steep sides, then bury themselves at the bottom. When prey inevitably stumbles into such a trap, the yellow dragon then moves its wings, causing the pit to collapse.": "狡猾陷阱者。与大多数其他龙不同，即使在它们生命的最后阶段，黄龙更喜欢使用伏击战术和陷阱来参与战斗。它们在身体上并不像一些其他龙族那样强大，但黄龙极其迅速，并且能够相对轻松地穿越水域、沙漠和岩石。它们充分利用这种独特的机动性，并且只会选择那些它们知道会以胜利结束的战斗。它们最喜欢的陷阱之一是挖一个锥形坑，有陡峭的边缘，然后埋藏在底部。当猎物不可避免地跌入这样的陷阱时，黄龙会扇动翅膀，导致坑塌陷。",
	"Isolationist. Due to the fact that yellow dragons are hated by most for being dragons, and hated by other dragons for their actions throughout history, they have become quite isolated. They speak a strange dialect of Draconic unique to yellow dragons and will typically not learn any other languages since they have no desire to communicate with anyone outside of their own kind. This adds another layer of complexity to encountering a yellow dragon. If an individual approaches without an understanding of their language, even if they use magic such as the tongues spell to communicate, the yellow dragon is unlikely to trust or respect them.": "孤立主义者。由于黄龙因为是龙而被大多数人憎恶，同时也因为历史上的行为而被其他龙憎恶，它们变得非常孤立。它们说一种奇怪的黄龙独有的龙语方言，通常不会学习其他语言，因为它们没有与自己种族之外的任何人交流的愿望。这使得面对黄龙变得更加复杂。如果有人不懂它们的语言靠近，即使使用诸如语言术这样的魔法进行交流，黄龙也不太可能信任或尊重他们。",

When a bagman comes through a bag of holding into the material world, it does so in an attempt to find its way back to wherever it originally came from. When it is unsuccessful in finding its home, the creature always attempts to drag another sentient creature back with it into the bizarre realm it calls home, the \"Space Between Spaces\". If its kidnapping attempt is successful, it will typically abandon the creature before long as it continues its quest to find a way back home. Creatures who don't make it back to the material world will find themselves slowly twisted into a new bagman, destined to the same nightly ritual of obsessively trying to find their way back to where they came from. Why bagmen kidnap creatures is a mystery. Some scholars posit that it is a twisted reflex. That maybe they recognize their own perverse nature and a part of them hopes to be delivered from their predicament by somebody with their mind still intact. Others believe they do so at the behest of a dark entity, an unknown evil that is responsible for the creation of the first bagman who uses them as a means to gather twisted subordinates for some scheme that is yet to be revealed.": "{@b {@i \"Men\", Not \"Man\".}} 传说中的袋人会让人误以为只有一个“袋人”，然而，现实却更加阴森恐怖。当一个袋人通过一个口袋空间进入物质世界时，它是在试图找到回到最初来时的地方。当它未能找到家园时，这个生物总是试图将另一个有思想的生物带回到它称之为家的怪异领域，“空间之间”。如果它的绑架尝试成功，它通常会很快抛弃这个生物，继续寻找回家的方法。那些无法回到物质世界的生物将发现自己慢慢扭曲成一个新的袋人，注定要陷入同样的夜间仪式，痴迷地试图找到他们最初来时的地方。袋人为什么绑架生物是一个谜。一些学者认为这是一种扭曲的反射。也许他们意识到自己的邪恶本性，希望有人能够拯救他们脱离困境，保持他们的理智。还有人认为他们是在某个黑暗实体的指使下行事，一个不知名的邪恶实体负责创造第一个袋人，并利用它们来收集扭曲的下属，为某个尚未揭示的计划服务。",

Every extra-dimensional space such as that found within a bag of holding or portable hole connects to an isolated fragment of this bizarre demi-plane, but for the bagmen and other creatures native to the \"Space Between Spaces\", a bag of holding is not an isolated area, but a gateway to and from the material world.

	"It was the most peculiar thing. The sun was high in the summer sky, the weather temperate and mild. Yet the farmers across the town fervently began to usher their animals inside. The braying of beasts could be heard in all directions, as not a farmhand stood idle, working towards a combined effort the likes of which I've never seen. Surely this town was far and away from my homeland, but I wouldn't imagine the way food is grown and animals tended to be much different here than anywhere else. I was wrong. I was finally able to grab the attention of a young man who had just finished ushering his cattle into shelter, he nearly jumped out of his skin when I grabbed his shoulder. \"What in the hells!\" he exclaimed, before realizing there was no danger. I asked him what all the fuss was about, and he simply replied \"It's coming\". What was I supposed to make of that? I looked all around, confused, seemingly the only sane individual for miles on end. Then suddenly, it was quiet. Everyone had gone inside. Not a soul in the streets to be seen. I made haste towards the inn, my home away from home these past few days. Perhaps someone there would be of assistance in clearing up my ignorance to whatever the issue at hand was. I walked up the creaky wooden steps, a faint breeze blowing through the bushes. Locked. I knocked for what seemed like a good few minutes before I got any response. The wind began to pick up. \"Mister, you better find somewhere to hide\" a small voice came from the other side of the door. This simply added to my confusion, but I was starting to get concerned. My horse, who was tied up near the watering trough began to cause a stir. The wind was becoming worrisome. How in the nine hells had these people known a storm was brewing on such a clear day. The polite knocking turned to pounding. Something was wrong. I could practically cut through this feeling with a dagger. A voice deep inside of me screamed it was no longer safe. I started to panic. What was happening? The wind was now howling, yet the clouds showed no sign of tempest. At this very moment I heard the door unlatch, and a small boy was standing there, a disgruntled looking father over his shoulder. \"Come in if yer comin' in\" bellowed the man as the boy grabbed my arm and guided me towards shelter. Just as I passed over that threshold, I saw, for the briefest moment, something I'm not fully sure I can describe. The sun was blotted out of the sky. At mid day, it became night. A shadow cast over the entire town. The wind became so violent, trees struggled to keep themselves within the dirt. Then there was that sound. A low, gut wrenching tone vibrated the very structure I stood upon. As the innkeep secured the door behind us, I rushed to the window. Pressed against the floor, revealing as little of myself as possible, I peered through the wooden reinforcements that covered most of the window. What I saw, was my horse. He was sailing through the air, grasped in the clutches of a monster the likes of which I have never conceived. The look on my face must have betrayed my state, as the boy sidled over to me, answering the question that would not escape my lips. In a soft tone, he simply said, \"Diablotra\".": "这是最奇怪的事情。夏日的阳光高高挂在天空中，天气温和宜人。然而，整个镇上的农民们却热切地开始把他们的动物赶进屋里。牲畜的嘶鸣声在四面八方响起，每个农场工人都在忙碌，合力进行着一场我从未见过的努力。这个小镇肯定远离了我的家乡，但我不会想象这里种植食物和照料动物的方式会比其他地方有多大不同。我错了。最终我成功吸引了一个刚刚把他的牛赶进棚里的年轻人的注意，当我抓住他的肩膀时，他几乎跳了起来。\"地狱！\"他惊叫道，然后意识到并没有危险。我问他这一切是怎么回事，他简单地回答说\"它来了\"。我应该如何理解这句话？我四处张望，困惑不解，似乎是这里唯一一个理智的人。突然间，一切都安静了。每个人都进屋了。街上一个人影都看不见。我匆忙赶往客栈，这几天来我在这里寄宿。也许那里会有人帮助我弄清楚眼下的问题。我走上吱吱作响的木楼梯，微风吹过灌木丛。锁着。我敲了好几分钟才有人回应。风渐渐变大。\"先生，你最好找个地方躲起来\"，门的另一边传来一个小声音。这让我更加困惑，但我开始感到担忧。我绑在水槽附近的马开始骚动。风变得令人担忧。这些人怎么会在这么晴朗的一天知道暴风雨即将来临呢。礼貌的敲门声变成了砰砰声。有什么不对劲。我几乎可以用匕首刺破这种感觉。我内心深处的声音尖叫着，这里不再安全。我开始恐慌。发生了什么？风现在呼啸着，但云层没有任何暴风雨的迹象。就在这时，我听到门被打开的声音，一个小男孩站在那里，一个愠怒的父亲站在他肩膀后面。\"进来吧，如果你要进来的话\"，男人大声说道，当男孩抓住我的胳膊引导我进入庇护所时。就在我跨过那个门槛的时候，我看到了一瞬间，我不确定我能否完全描述出来的东西。太阳被天空遮蔽了。在正午，变成了黑夜。整个小镇都笼罩在阴影之下。风变得如此猛烈，树木难以保持在土壤中。然后那声音。一种低沉、令人心痛的音调震动着我所站立的建筑物。当客栈老板在我们身后锁上门时，我冲向窗户。我躺在地板上，尽量不暴露自己，透过大部分被木头加固的窗户，我看到了我的马。它被一个我从未想象过的怪物抓在手中，飞翔在空中。我脸上的表情一定暴露了我的状态，男孩走过来，回答了我心中无法言说的问题。他用柔和的语气简单地说道：\"迪亚布洛特拉\"。",
	"In the far reaches to the North, where the Sea of Stars meets its end, dark waves lap upon the shores of gold. Few have been to such a place, and fewer still would speak its name. The island of ten thousand crowns, or so they say. Riches beyond your wildest dreams, there for the taking. Yet this place finds itself inked on no map. Charted by no captain. Sung of by no bards in the tavern firelight. The golden shores of Rathma are not something people will so readily discuss. Those who have actually seen the twisted land find themselves mute upon its mention. They speak only cryptic warnings of things so absurd, you'd have to be a madman to conceive them. A civilization long thought dead. The King of Ash, presiding over a tribal society. Gnarled pools of twisting organisms. Monsters that would drain a man dry of blood within seconds. Then, there's the most outlandish of them all. The living tsunami. The monstrosity so large it could snap a ship in two with a single claw as though it were a mere splinter. The protector goddess of the golden shores. Praesigira. As if something so outlandish could actually exist. Surely the only reason this island paradise has not been conquered is because it simply doesn't exist. Or, does it? Remember when I said this exotic locale has found no purchase inked on parchment? I lied. For there was one man, one absolutely broken man, who came back from the edge of the world. He hasn't said a word since he washed up on shore. He simply trembles, eyes bulging, frantically looking in all directions. Clutched In his hand as his wretched form met the docks? A finely crafted scrap of lambskin.

	"Nocturnal Hunters. Purple dragons mostly feed on livestock, large wild animals, and any humanoid creatures foolish enough to settle near them.

	"Not so Deep Afterall. Many sages make the mistake of conflating purple dragons with deep dragons on account of the fact that their scales bear a similar appearance. This is only made more confusing due to the similar nesting habits of the two species. Purple dragons and deep dragons both burrow into the ground and make their homes in complex cave systems, however, deep dragons will typically burrow well into the Underdark, while purple dragons are still considered surface dwelling creatures. It is possible that the first deep dragons were indeed purple dragons that simply acclimated to life in the underdark, but both species are so rare that there can't be any consensus on their possible relation.": "毕竟并不那么深奥。许多贤者犯了一个错误，将紫龙与深龙混淆，因为它们的鳞片外观相似。由于这两种物种有着相似的筑巢习性，这种混淆只会变得更加令人困惑。紫龙和深龙都会钻入地下，建造复杂的洞穴系统作为家园，然而，深龙通常会钻得更深进入地底世界，而紫龙则仍被视为地表栖息的生物。第一批深龙可能是最初只是适应了地底生活的紫龙，但由于这两种物种都非常罕见，人们对它们可能的关系没有达成共识。",
	"Cunning Linguists. Although it is not known exactly how or why, it seems that all purple dragons are gifted with the unique ability to understand and be understood by any creature capable of speaking words aloud. This ancestral knowledge of all spoken language is passed down from parent to child biologically, meaning that every purple dragon is born with the ability to speak with anyone moments after hatching from their egg. Purple dragons readily make use of this ability, typically amassing large followings of loyal minions that will do their bidding for the promise of power and other tangible rewards. It is said that anywhere a purple dragon is spotted, there is certainly a network of criminals, spies, thieves, and other creatures with ill-intentions working on the dragon's behalf.  Many purple dragons consider their servants to be a fine collection and often have obvious favorites among them.": "狡猾的语言学家。虽然不清楚具体原因，但似乎所有紫色龙都天生具有独特的能力，能理解并被任何能够大声说话的生物理解。这种对所有口语的祖传知识是通过生物学方式由父母传给孩子的，这意味着每只紫色龙在从蛋中孵化出来后的片刻就具备了与任何人交谈的能力。紫色龙通常会充分利用这种能力，通常聚集大批忠诚的追随者，他们会为了权力和其他实际奖励而听命于紫色龙。据说只要有紫色龙出现的地方，肯定会有一群罪犯、间谍、小偷和其他心怀不轨的生物在为龙效劳。许多紫色龙认为他们的仆人是一批优秀的收藏品，并经常在其中有明显的偏爱。",
	"Family First. While not necessarily always the case, unlike most other dragons it is very common for purple dragon families to stay together. Couplings of purple dragons will usually have few children for this reason, and any children they do have will typically only leave the nest if there is some kind of disagreement between them and their family. This knack for remaining together makes purple dragons especially dangerous and is why hunting young purple dragons is almost universally seen as an idiotic exercise, for even if you succeed, the hunter's town may yet pay the price for their actions.": "家庭至上。虽然并非总是如此，但与大多数其他龙不同，紫龙家族通常会保持在一起。出于这个原因，紫龙的配对通常会只有几个孩子，而他们所拥有的孩子通常只有在与家人发生分歧时才会离开巢穴。这种保持在一起的能力使紫龙特别危险，这也是为什么猎杀年幼的紫龙几乎被普遍视为愚蠢的行为，因为即使你成功了，猎人的城镇也可能为他们的行为付出代价。",
	"Purple dragons make their homes deep in the rock of mountainous areas and foothills. Their lairs are complex networks of overlapping tunnels which can run for miles depending on the size, age, and number of dragons present, but the most important thing is that their lair remains dark in order to maximize the effects of their blinding breath weapon. Should the dragon encounter stone too hard to dig through while creating its lair, the dragon's breath weapon can melt solid rock at a rapid rate, allowing them to forge ahead. These subterranean lairs often have numerous openings which allow the dragon to move around freely undetected by most within the bowels of the stone and dirt. Each entrance to the purple dragon's lair is meticulously hidden, and will usually open up near a prairie or field with ample prey.": "紫龙深深栖息在山区和山麓的岩石中。它们的巢穴是复杂的交错隧道网络，根据龙的大小、年龄和数量，这些隧道可以延伸数英里，但最重要的是它们的巢穴保持黑暗，以最大限度地发挥其致盲吐息的效果。如果龙在挖掘巢穴时遇到太难穿透的石头，龙的吐息能以极快的速度融化坚固的岩石，让它们能够继续前进。这些地下巢穴通常有许多入口，让龙能够在石头和泥土的深处自由移动，大多数人都察觉不到。每个紫龙巢穴的入口都被精心隐藏，通常会开在一个有大量猎物的草原或田野附近。",

As much as warping themselves into another shape is unpleasant, the sensation of returning to its true form is quite exhilarating and results in a momentary burst of euphoria for the Ugothol.": "可怕的变形生物。最初设计成为间谍，可以在呼吸空气的种族中行走而不受干扰，无面潜行者通过重塑他们的皮肤和扭曲他们的橡胶般的身体来采取新形态。这种痛苦的过程大约需要10分钟的不间断时间，这并不是乌戈索尔（Ugothol）喜欢做的事情。乌戈索尔通常会寻找一个私人地方进行变形，甚至避开自己种族中的其他人。尽管将自己扭曲成另一个形态是令人不愉快的，但回到真实形态的感觉却是令乌戈索尔感到非常兴奋，并导致短暂的幸福感爆发。",

	"At the end of the faceless stalker's turn, if it is grappling a creature with blood, that creature takes 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage.

Performing this transformation is somewhat painful, but the faceless stalker can maintain its new form indefinitely once it is finished. Its statistics are the same in each form.

When it changes back to its true form it has advantage on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 minute.": "一个无面潜行者可以假扮成一个中等身形的人形生物。这个新形态可以模仿它见过的生物，或者仅仅由它选择的特征组成。需要连续10分钟来改变它的身体。在模仿另一个生物的形态时，它在欺骗检定中具有优势，以假扮成那个生物。进行这种变形有些痛苦，但无面潜行者一旦完成变形，就可以无限期地保持新形态。它在每种形态下的统计数据都是相同的。它穿戴的或携带的任何装备都不会被转变。它可以使用一个奖励动作变回真实形态。当它变回真实形态时，攻击检定、技能检定和豁免检定都具有优势，持续1分钟。",

Others hold that they were created by a long-forgotten demigod to serve as bodyguards. It is theorised that, whatever their original purpose, they failed in that endeavour, and their master was lost to a cosmic rival. Left without direction, they settled into the role of mercenaries. Whatever the truth, as beings of neutrality, concordant killers are concerned with the balance of all forces in the planes. They understand that defeating a powerful foe might tip the scales one way or another. Therefore they track their kills as a group, endeavouring to distribute their prey evenly among the the forces of the multiverse. . They keep the location of such meetings secret, though many sages believe they congregate near the central spire of the Outlands. Even deities' magic is impeded there, making it a perfect spot for clandestine gatherings.": "完美平衡。拥有天界和恶魔血统的和谐杀手是纯中立存在。有人说和谐杀手是中立之神的实验，他们试图创造维持宇宙平衡的完美管理者。其他人认为它们是由一个被遗忘的半神创造出来担任保镖。有理论认为，无论它们最初的目的是什么，它们在那个努力中失败了，它们的主人被宇宙中的对手所失去。失去方向后，它们开始扮演雇佣兵的角色。无论真相如何，作为中立存在，和谐杀手关心平面世界中所有力量的平衡。他们明白打败一个强大的敌人可能会使天平倾斜。因此，他们以团体形式追踪他们的猎物，努力将其平均分配给多元宇宙的力量。他们保持这类会议的地点秘密，尽管许多贤者相信他们聚集在外域的中央尖塔附近。甚至神灵的魔法在那里受到阻碍，使其成为秘密聚会的理想场所。",

Effective yet discreet, they are highly sought after by powerful entities such as demon lords, demigods, and even deities to do their dirty work. A concordant killer is dismissive of any prospective employer, though, unless offered substantial payment.  Concordant killers trade their services for favours, having little need for material possessions. Sometimes they request these favours at the time of hiring, but usually a contract for future payment suffices. Even gods are indebted to the concordant killers and so might look the other way, leave a planar portal open, provide information on a target's whereabouts, or undertake other favours that help the killers achieve their objectives.

	"Draconic Rivalries.  Their choice of climate can sometimes put them at odds with black dragons, who also tend to nest in damp locations such as swamps or mires. When this competition for territory arises, black dragons will almost always avoid fighting the more powerful orange dragons, opting either to leave entirely or begrudgingly accept a subordinate role to the orange dragon. Such alliances, however, are fragile and the black dragon will turn on its superior if it thinks it can win in a fight. Orange dragons also have a natural enemy in bronze dragons, who often compete with them for food and territory along the shorelines. Orange dragons seldom attempt to fight with their bronze rivals since they are much more evenly matched than their black dragon cousins.": "龙族之间的竞争。他们选择的气候有时会与黑龙产生冲突，后者也倾向于筑巢在潮湿的地方，如沼泽或泥沼。当这种领地竞争出现时，黑龙几乎总是会避免与更强大的橙色龙战斗，选择要么完全离开，要么勉强接受橙色龙的从属地位。然而，这种联盟是脆弱的，如果黑龙认为自己可以在战斗中获胜，它会背叛上级。橙色龙的天敌是青铜龙，后者经常与它们在海岸线上为食物和领地而竞争。橙色龙很少尝试与青铜龙对抗，因为它们与黑龙族群相比更加势均力敌。",
	"Solitary Creatures. Orange dragons, like many of their kin, prefer to live in solitude. The one exception to this is when they have found a mate and are caring for a nest of eggs. During this time both parents contribute equally to protecting the nest and raising their young. Once the brood of orange dragons mature beyond the wyrmling stage, they are set to their own devices and the parents typically go their separate ways.": "孤独的生物。橙色龙，像他们的许多同类一样，更喜欢独居。唯一的例外是当它们找到配偶并照顾一窝蛋时。在这段时间里，两位父母都会平等地保护巢穴并抚养他们的后代。一旦橙色龙的幼龙们超过幼龙阶段，它们就会独立行动，而父母通常会各自选择自己的道路。",
	"Omnivorous Diets. Orange dragons are mostly meat eaters, feeding on rain forest creatures and fish primarily, but enjoying tropical fruits as well. Humanoid creatures are also appreciated from time to time for the sport they provide the dragon, until they are finally caught and devoured that is. If nothing else is available, the dragon will resort to eating giant insects or fungus if it must. While this is not pleasant for the dragon, its natural poison resistance prevents it from becoming ill.": "杂食性饮食。橙色龙主要以肉食为主，主要以雨林生物和鱼类为食，但也喜欢热带水果。人形生物有时也会被龙所欣赏，因为它们为龙提供了运动的乐趣，直到最终被捕捉并吞食。如果没有其他食物可用，龙将不得不食用巨大的昆虫或真菌。虽然这对龙来说并不愉快，但它天生对毒素具有抵抗力，因此不会生病。",

These warriors share traits with insects such as the katydid. They come in a wide variety of shapes from noble spindly forms to powerhouses wrapped in thick armoured shells. The third variety of warrior is the nectar. They descend from insects such as the butterfly or wasp. Nektar spirit warriors are brightly coloured with iridescent thoraxes and alternating bands of colour across their abdomens. Their wings are large and colourful, with various patterns.

	"Labour of Love. The process of creating a spirit warrior is a lengthy one. It all starts with an egg, no bigger than a sack of grain. This egg is given to the spirit warriors would-be pilot to nurture and protect. When the egg hatches, the pilot must nurture and protect the fragile larva from six months to a year, until it is mature. During this time the insect forms a close emotional bond with the pilot, similar to that of a pet or loyal familiar. After a year the insect is mature, and the spells of modification can begin, however, most pilots choose to delay this process until after the insect has died of old age. If the spells are performed on a living insect, it dies during the ceremony. This is not only cruel, but also serves to weaken the emotional bond between insect and pilot.  The insect becomes a spirit warrior via spells that enlarge, animate, strengthen, and physically modify the insect's exoskeletal remains. These spells also link the minds of pilot and insect in an unbreakable bond, unaffected by magic, disease, physical attack, or mental control. The final stage of the process instals a special helm in the hollow chest cavity of the insect warrior. Once the process is complete, the spirit warrior and pilot can begin working together as a unified pair. In the event that someone other than the original pilot attempts to control the spirit warrior, the insect's spirit gets some say in the matter. If it rejects the new pilot, it can attempt to cause them psychic trauma and shut itself down. Though there are always those who would take their power by force if given the means.": "爱的劳动。创造一个灵魂战士的过程是漫长的。一切都始于一个鸡蛋，不比一袋谷物大。这个鸡蛋被交给灵魂战士未来的飞行员来培育和保护。当鸡蛋孵化时，飞行员必须在六个月到一年的时间里培育和保护这个脆弱的幼虫，直到它成熟。在这段时间里，昆虫与飞行员形成了一种类似于宠物或忠诚伙伴的紧密情感纽带。一年后，昆虫成熟了，修改法术就可以开始了，然而，大多数飞行员选择延迟这个过程，直到昆虫因老年而死。如果在昆虫还活着时施展法术，它会在仪式中死去。这不仅残忍，还会削弱昆虫与飞行员之间的情感纽带。通过扩大、赋予生命、强化和物理修改昆虫外骨骼遗骸的法术，昆虫成为了灵魂战士。这些法术还会将飞行员和昆虫的思维联系在一起，形成一种不可打破的纽带，不受魔法、疾病、物理攻击或精神控制的影响。这个过程的最后阶段是在昆虫战士的空心胸腔中安装一个特殊的头盔。一旦过程完成，灵魂战士和飞行员就可以作为一个统一的团队开始合作。如果除了原飞行员之外的其他人试图控制灵魂战士，昆虫的灵魂就会有发言权。如果它拒绝新飞行员，它可以试图给他们造成心理创伤并关闭自己。尽管总有些人如果有机会的话会用暴力夺取他们的力量。",

A creature can enter or exit the cockpit by using an action.

Their wings are small and muscular. The eyes of a gray dragon tend to be a glittering red or orange, and their heads are adorned with many small spikes and a set of sharp horns.": "灰龙是贪婪、掠夺和狡猾的生物。它们的身体覆盖着骨板，形成突出的刺。它们的尾巴异常长，分叉，带有一对镰刀状的骨刃。它们的鳞片呈斑驳的灰色和棕色，嘴里布满尖牙。它们的翅膀小而有力。灰龙的眼睛通常闪耀着红色或橙色，头部装饰着许多小尖刺和一对锋利的角。",
	"Thrill Of The Hunt. Gray dragons consider themselves the top of the food chain and unparalleled hunters. They are exceptionally skilled in the ways of tracking and slaughtering prey. They do this not just to feed themselves, but because they relish in the act of the hunt. Gray dragons feel at their best when they are stalking a creature that poses a real challenge. While they will resort to killing and eating livestock and other dull creatures to avoid starvation, they take no pleasure in the act. To them, the hunt is just as, if not more important, than the meal itself. They actively seek out powerful and elusive creatures so that they might hunt and kill them. Once they actually have their prey cornered, they take their time, making sure to savor the moment. They enjoy toying with their prey until they become bored and decide to go for the killing blow.": "猎杀的刺激。灰龙认为自己处于食物链的顶端，是无与伦比的猎手。他们在追踪和屠杀猎物方面技艺高超。他们这样做不仅是为了养活自己，更是因为他们热爱狩猎的行为。灰龙觉得自己在追踪一个真正具有挑战性的生物时处于最佳状态。虽然他们会诉诸杀戮和吞食牲畜和其他乏味的生物以避免饥饿，但他们并不从中获得乐趣。对他们来说，狩猎本身就和进餐一样重要，甚至更重要。他们积极寻找强大而难以捕捉的生物，以便狩猎和杀死它们。一旦他们真的把猎物逼入绝境，他们会花时间，确保细细品味这一刻。他们喜欢戏弄猎物，直到厌倦并决定进行致命一击。",
	"Venal Creatures. Gray dragons are among the most flippant draconic creatures to be found anywhere in the world. Their mood changes in an instant, and their words mean very little. They frequently turn diplomatic discussions into a game of cat and mouse. If an individual speaking with them fails to hold the dragon's attention, the creature is liable to give the individual a half day's head start with instructions to run and hide before chasing them down for its own amusement. However, for those with something of substance to offer a gray dragon, they can become a powerful ally. Gray dragons have little interest in treasure or riches, but the prospect to hunt a worthy opponent is an offer a gray dragon simply can't refuse. Many gray dragons take up bounty hunting contracts on behalf of anyone who can offer them a proper challenge. These contracts frequently turn into regular working relationships where a gray dragon might rely on a kingdom's bounty board for a steady flow of creatures to hunt, the more dangerous and elusive, the better.": "贪婪生物。灰龙是世界上最反复无常的龙类生物之一。它们的情绪瞬息万变，言辞几乎毫无意义。它们经常把外交讨论变成一场猫鼠游戏。如果与它们交谈的个体无法吸引龙的注意，那么这个生物可能会给予个体半天的领先时间，并告诉他们跑开躲藏，然后追捕他们以取乐。然而，对于那些能够给灰龙提供实质性东西的人来说，它们可以成为强大的盟友。灰龙对财宝或财富几乎没有兴趣，但有机会追逐一个值得挑战的对手是灰龙无法拒绝的邀约。许多灰龙接受代表任何能够给予适当挑战的人的赏金猎杀合同。这些合同经常演变成定期的工作关系，灰龙可能依赖某个王国的赏金榜来获得稳定的猎物来源，而且越危险和难以捕捉的越好。",
	"Grim Momentos. Since they have little to no interest in gold and riches, gray dragon's don't hoard valuables in the same way other dragon's might. What they do collect are mementos and trinkets taken from their successful hunts. A gray dragon will keep a vast collection of odds and ends that to anyone else, might seem to be completely useless. These \"treasures\" are all objects of sentimental value to the dragon. What to an onlooker might seem to be a random stone block could be a remnant from a powerful wizard's tower the dragon tore down to get to the spellcaster within. A cracked wagon wheel might be from the wagon of a thief who thought they could flee by horse and carriage. A single pauldron might be from a noble knight who sought to challenge the dragon's authority. Every item within the dragon's collection has a story, and the dragon is bound to know them all. While intrinsic value is of little concern, there are always bound to be a few magical artifacts or useful items that find themselves within this collection by mere happenstance. The older the dragon, the more likely this is to be the case.": "阴郁的时刻。由于对黄金和财富几乎没有兴趣，灰龙不像其他龙那样囤积财宝。它们收集的是来自成功狩猎的纪念品和小玩意。灰龙会保留大量看似毫无用处的杂物，但对其他人来说，这些“珍宝”都是龙的情感价值物品。对旁观者来说，一个看似随意的石块可能是龙拆除的强大巫师塔楼的遗迹，为了抓住其中的法术施法者。一个破裂的马车车轮可能来自一个以为可以乘马车逃跑的小偷的马车。一个护肩可能来自一个试图挑战龙权威的贵族骑士。龙收藏的每件物品都有一个故事，而龙必定知道它们的来龙去脉。虽然内在价值并不重要，但总会有一些魔法物品或有用的物品因为偶然事件而进入这个收藏。龙越老，这种情况发生的可能性就越大。",
	"A Gray Dragon's Lair": "一只灰色龙的巢穴（Gray Dragon）",
	"Gray dragons are seldom found in their lair as they are often far away from home stalking prey or seeking out their next avaricious goal. They do, however, maintain a location as their home, even if they aren't there very often. They typically claim secluded locations in badlands, scrublands, dry prairies, or other areas with few visual obstructions. A gray dragon likes to see potential quarry for miles around as they fly high through the air like massive birds of prey. So keen is the eyesight of a gray dragon that it can spot the tiniest movement across a plain from miles away. Once it spots a target, it is liable to dance from cloud to cloud for hours, seeking to bridge the gap between it and its target before swooping in. Gray dragons are also one of the only draconic species that form temporary lairs. While on an extended hunt, far away from its permanent home, a gray dragon is likely to set up a base of operations it can rest in while not actively hunting its prey. Since a gray dragon's permanent lair might stand abandoned for weeks or months at a time, before leaving to go on a hunt, the dragon makes sure to seal the entrance to its home with large rocks or other such obstructions to keep nosy creatures far away.": "灰龙很少在它们的巢穴中被发现，因为它们经常远离家园潜行猎物或寻找下一个贪婪的目标。然而，它们会保持一个地点作为家，即使它们并不经常在那里。它们通常会选择在荒地、灌木地、干旱的草原或其他视觉障碍较少的地方建立隐蔽的巢穴。灰龙喜欢在空中高飞，像巨大的猛禽一样，可以看到周围数英里外的潜在猎物。灰龙的视力是如此敏锐，它可以从数英里之外发现平原上最微小的动静。一旦发现目标，它可能会在云层间舞动数小时，试图缩短与目标之间的距离，然后扑向目标。灰龙也是唯一形成临时巢穴的龙类物种之一。在进行长途狩猎时，远离永久家园的灰龙可能会建立一个基地，可以在不主动狩猎猎物时休息。由于灰龙的永久巢穴可能会被弃置数周或数月，然后离开去狩猎，龙会确保用大石块或其他障碍物封住巢穴的入口，以阻止好奇的生物靠近。",

While their appearance might be jarring at first, most communities eventually welcome neighbouring bionoid settlements as they are often both peaceful allies and capable defenders if trouble should appear. While bionoids largely don't wish for warfare, they do still maintain a warrior culture. They train in combat both as a way to protect themselves, and achieve tranquillity over both body and mind. As beings engineered for warfare, they find this helps them control the power they have been granted.": "坚定的战士。尽管受到他们前任同胞的对待，生物合成体并没有让自己陷入绝望和仇恨。他们在遍布多元宇宙的小殖民地中过着相对平静的生活。他们没有统一的家园可言，因此他们在各种地方都能找到自己的归属。虽然他们的外表可能一开始会让人感到不适，但大多数社区最终会欢迎邻近的生物合成体定居点，因为他们通常既是和平盟友，也是有能力的防御者。虽然生物合成体大多不希望发生战争，但他们仍然保持着战士文化。他们接受战斗训练，既是为了保护自己，也是为了在身心上达到宁静。作为被设计用于战争的存在，他们发现这有助于控制自己被赋予的力量。",
	"Weird Eggs. Bionoids reproduce in a highly peculiar way. Fully mature bionoid eggs are disc-shaped objects roughly six inches in diameter. They're rigid, dark green in colour, and covered in a thin layer of mucus. In the centre of each egg is the crystalline gem that will eventually find itself in the forehead of the fully grown bionoid. When another living creature touches the egg, it reacts and latches itself onto them, forming a shell around the creature's body. This shell is the bionoid. Once the bionoid has reached the first stage of maturity, usually after about six months, the creature separates itself from the host and begins life as an independent creature. During the time the egg is attached to the host, the bionoid has full control of the creature, though it may choose to relinquish control if it wants. While attached to the host, the two creatures also share a telepathic link and are able to communicate with one another at any time. If the host dies before the bionoid separates itself, the bionoid will revert back to its egg form. This process is typically harmless for the host being, if not unpleasant.": "奇怪的蛋。生物合成体以一种非常奇特的方式繁殖。完全成熟的生物合成体蛋是直径约六英寸的圆盘状物体。它们坚硬，深绿色，并覆盖着一层薄薄的黏液。每个蛋的中心是最终会出现在完全成熟的生物合成体额头上的晶莹宝石。当另一个生物触摸到蛋时，它会反应并附着在它们身上，形成一个围绕生物体的壳。这个壳就是生物合成体。一旦生物合成体达到第一阶段成熟，通常大约六个月后，生物体就会从寄主身上分离出来，开始独立生活。在蛋附着在寄主身上的时候，生物合成体完全控制着生物体，尽管它可以选择放弃控制。当附着在寄主身上时，这两个生物也分享一种心灵感应的联系，可以随时彼此交流。如果寄主在生物合成体分离之前死亡，生物合成体将恢复到蛋的形态。这个过程通常对寄主来说是无害的，尽管可能不愉快。",
	"All bionoids have a crystalline eye in the centre of their forehead. If the bionoid is reduced to 0 hit points, this crystal eye traps its soul and essence inside of the gem. If the crystalline gem is not destroyed, after 24 hours the bionoid will regenerate around it in a process that takes one round. While not embedded in the bionoid's head, the gem has an AC of 5 and 20 hit points.": "所有生物合体在额头中央都有一个晶体眼。如果生物合体的生命值降至0，这颗晶体眼会将其灵魂和本质困在宝石内。如果晶体宝石没有被摧毁，在24小时后，生物合体将在其周围再生，这个过程需要一个回合的时间。当宝石没有镶嵌在生物合体的头部时，宝石的防御等级为5，拥有20点生命值。",
	"The bionoid can jump up to 10 feet in the air from a standing position, and up to 20 feet if it moves at least 10 feet on the ground before the jump. When the bionoid jumps, it can make a stomp attack against a target in any space adjacent to where it lands by using a bonus action.": "生物合金体(bionoid)可以从站立位置跳跃高达10英尺，如果在跳跃前至少在地面上移动了10英尺，它可以跳高达20英尺。当生物合金体跳跃时，它可以利用一个奖励动作对着它降落的相邻空间内的目标进行踩踏攻击。",

	"The bionoid's chest plates peel back to reveal a magically charged organ which unleashes a 30-foot cone of burning energy. All creatures in the area take 38 ({@damage 11d6}) fire damage, or half as much on a successful {@dc 14} Dexterity Saving Throw. The bionoid then takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) force damage as a result of the toll this attack takes on its body.": "生物合金体的胸甲褪开，露出一个魔力充能的器官，释放出一个长30英尺的燃烧能量锥。区域内所有生物受到38 ({@damage 11d6}) 火焰伤害，或者在成功的 {@dc 14} 敏捷豁免检定后减半。随后，生物合金体因为这次攻击对身体的损耗而受到10 ({@damage 3d6}) 力场伤害。",

	"Words Unsaid. Painspeakers  were once humanoids who died with some important message left unsaid, whether a courier who failed to deliver an entreaty for peace, a hopeful lover who failed to speak their heart, or a witness who failed to step forth and speak the truth. For these creatures, death and the failure to speak were the same anguish. Having risen because of the tortured words that they failed to utter, painspeakers now give voice to their pain in Truespeech, blighting the lives of others with the power of the spoken word.": "未说的话。痛苦者（Painspeakers）曾经是一些未能传达重要信息而死去的人形生物，无论是一个未能传递和平请求的信使，一个未能表达心意的恋人，还是一个未能站出来说出真相的目击者。对于这些生物来说，死亡和未能说出口的痛苦是一样的折磨。因为他们未能说出口的折磨的话语而复活，痛苦者现在用真言（Truespeech）发出他们的痛苦之音，用口头之力折磨他人的生活。",
	"Spoken Truth. The thing that bonds a painspeaker to the material world and prevents their spirit from moving on to the afterlife is that sense of mournful regret surrounding their failure to be heard in life. This idea has festered and become corrupted to the point where the desire to speak manifests as twisted words from the Language of Creation. Their seemingly mindless gibbering is indeed a lengthy curse that can undo even the most stalwart heroes.": "真言。将痛苦言说者与物质世界紧密联系在一起，阻止他们的灵魂前往来世的是那种悲伤的遗憾感，围绕着他们在生前未被倾听的失败。这个想法已经腐化到了一种程度，使得渴望言说的欲望表现为扭曲的创世语言之词。他们看似毫无意识的胡言乱语实际上是一种漫长的诅咒，甚至可以击败最坚定的英雄。",
