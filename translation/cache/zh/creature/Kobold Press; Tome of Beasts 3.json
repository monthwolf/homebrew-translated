	"Each creature in this book lists an alignment to provide a general guideline for that creature's typical behaviors, often based on its preferred prey or its most commonly observed interactions with other sentient creatures. A creature whose alignment is listed as \"unaligned\" is either created or controlled by another, such as a construct, or operates on more primal or instinctive behavior, such as a {@creature rat} or {@creature tiger}.": "这本书中的每个生物都列出了一个取向，以提供该生物典型行为的一般准则，通常基于其首选猎物或其与其他有思维生物的互动中最常见的行为。如果一个生物的取向列为“无取向”，那么它可能是由另一个生物创造或控制，比如一个构造体，或者它可能是根据更原始或本能的行为运作，比如一个{@creature rat}或{@creature tiger}。",

	"Several fey creatures in this book have resistance or immunity to attacks from weapons that aren't made with {@item cold iron weapon|ToB3|cold iron}. This design choice comes from folklore, where cold-wrought iron was believed to be capable of repelling or harming fairies, ghosts, witches, and other supernatural creatures. In this book, lords and ladies of the fey courts are timeless creatures, inured to many of the world's threats—except weapons of cold-wrought iron. This metal undoes the very fabric of a fey creature's life as it blights their ageless flesh.": "本书中的几种精灵生物对非用{@item cold iron weapon|ToB3|cold iron}制造的武器具有抵抗力或免疫力。这一设计选择源自民间传说，冷锻铁被认为能够驱逐或伤害仙子、鬼魂、女巫和其他超自然生物。在本书中，精灵法庭的贵族们是永恒的生物，对世界上许多威胁都免疫，唯独对冷锻铁制造的武器无法抵御。这种金属会破坏精灵生物生命的本质，使他们那永恒的肌肤枯萎。",
	"A {@item cold iron weapon|ToB3} is treated as magical when used against any fey creature, and it is the only weapon with any hope of harming the most powerful fey lords and ladies. However, {@item cold iron weapon|ToB3|cold iron weapons} are difficult to construct. The skill and material required to produce such a weapon doubles its price or adds 100 gp to the cost, whichever is more. Finding a smith with the skill to make a durable weapon without the aid of fire is always difficult—and finding one with the courage to anger the fey courts may be even harder.": "一把{@item cold iron weapon|ToB3}在用于对抗任何精灵生物时被视为魔法武器，它是唯一有希望伤害到最强大的精灵领主和女士的武器。然而，制造{@item cold iron weapon|ToB3|cold iron weapons}是困难的。制作这样一把武器所需的技巧和材料使其价格翻倍，或者增加100gp的成本，以较高者为准。要找到一个具备制作坚固武器技能且无需火焰辅助的铁匠总是很困难的——而要找到一个有勇气惹怒精灵法庭的铁匠可能更难。",
	"If cold iron doesn't exist in your world, you can substitute this resistance or immunity with {@item silvered weapon|phb|silver} or {@item adamantine weapon|xge|adamantine}, whichever you feel is most appropriate for that creature in your world.": "如果在你的世界中不存在冷铁，你可以用{@item silvered weapon|phb|silver}或{@item adamantine weapon|xge|adamantine}来替代这种抗性或免疫力，选择你认为在你的世界中更合适的那种。",

However, in your flickering torchlight you see three tall, lanky-limbed creatures.

	"Many of us have experienced something like this before; I know I have countless times over the years, both as a player and game master. The book you hold in your hands right now is a key ingredient in keeping your game time fresh and engaging. Sure, as a player it's helpful to know everything about the creature you encounter, but, in my opinion, that misses a big part of what's enjoyable in a fantasy roleplaying game. The first time we took up dice and pencil in search of adventure, the whole multiverse was new and unknown. Wonderment permeated the entire experience, increasing the excitement and ensuring we embarked upon a collective hero's journey with the rest of the players.": "我们中的许多人以前都经历过类似的事情；多年来，无论是作为玩家还是游戏主持人，我都经历过无数次。你现在手中拿着的这本书是保持你的游戏时间新鲜和引人入胜的关键因素。当然，作为玩家，了解你遇到的生物的一切是有帮助的，但在我看来，这忽略了幻想角色扮演游戏中令人愉悦的重要部分。第一次拿起骰子和铅笔寻找冒险时，整个多元宇宙都是新的、未知的。惊奇弥漫在整个经历中，增加了兴奋感，并确保我们与其他玩家一起踏上集体英雄之旅。",
	"My earliest childhood memories are being around the gaming table playing games with my dad. Hearing him describe the dungeon environment as our group of intrepid adventures delved below Castle Greyhawk enthralled me completely. The air was thick with tension as we carefully explored. I didn't know what we were going to discover around the corner or behind the next door, but I knew there was danger lurking somewhere. And when we did eventually encounter a creature in that subterranean setting, we didn't know what it was or any of its capabilities. This formula heightened the suspense, focusing our attention on this puzzle that was an unknown creature. And it set conditions for my father, as the game master, to reveal the monster's powers with dramatic effect. These early experiences helped cement my love of gaming that has remained unquelled for well over forty years. The {@i Tome of Beasts 3}, with its over four hundred new creatures, can help you have the same experience, piquing your players' attention and horrifying the hearts of your know-it-alls!": "我最早的童年记忆是围绕着游戏桌与我爸爸一起玩游戏。听他描述地牢环境，当我们一群勇敢的冒险者深入灰鹰城堡下方时，我完全沉浸其中。空气中弥漫着紧张气氛，我们小心翼翼地探索着。我不知道我们将在拐角处或下一个门后发现什么，但我知道危险潜伏在某处。当我们最终在那个地下场景中遇到生物时，我们不知道它是什么，也不了解它的任何能力。这种情节增加了悬念，将我们的注意力集中在这个未知生物的谜题上。这为我父亲作为游戏主持人展示怪物的能力创造了条件，效果十分戏剧化。这些早期经历帮助巩固了我对游戏的热爱，这种热情已经持续了四十多年。{@i Tome of Beasts 3}，拥有四百多种新生物，可以帮助你获得同样的体验，引起玩家的注意，并让你那些自以为是的玩家们心惊胆战！",
	"My daughter Miriam and I are fortunate enough to have a creature we created grace the pages of the {@i Tome of Beasts 3}. It was a wonderful experience to relive one of the things I enjoyed so much with my dad—creating new things! We fleshed out the basics of the {@creature haakjir|ToB3} as we hiked around one of the many hills near our home in Calabasas, CA. She wanted a beast that could climb up and down stone like a fossa, a carnivorous mammal that inhabits Madagascar. We bounced ideas off of each other and by the time the walk was done, I discovered I had a well of creative energy ready. Her fresh outlook and entertaining discussion gave me a new perspective.": "我和我的女儿米里亚姆很幸运，我们创造的生物出现在{@i Tome of Beasts 3}的页面上。能够与她一起体验我和父亲一起享受的事情之一——创造新事物，真是太棒了！我们在加利福尼亚州卡拉巴萨斯家附近的一个小山丘上徒步时，构思了{@creature haakjir|ToB3}的基本概念。她想要一个能像马达加斯加栖息的食肉哺乳动物猛犸猫一样攀爬石头的野兽。我们互相碰撞想法，散步结束时，我发现自己充满了创造力。她新鲜的观点和有趣的讨论让我有了新的视角。",
	"I posit to you, my fellow roleplaying game enthusiast, that preserving or reinvigorating the sense of the unknown, the wonderment felt by your players, will help renew them and propel your game experience to even greater heights. When we encounter something new, we have to focus on it in order to discover and understand it. The result is players are more present, and dare I say, phones lie forgotten beside them, as they focus on figuring out how best to resolve the situation you have presented to them. There are many tools available to level up your game from miniatures and terrain to virtual tabletops and story props, but for me, one of the best techniques to keep players fully engaged is the wonderment of new challenges—keep them on their toes and the fun will follow!": "我向你提出，我的 fellow 角色扮演游戏爱好者，保留或重振玩家们感受到的未知感、惊叹感，将有助于激发他们，并将你的游戏体验推向更高境界。当我们遇到新事物时，我们必须专注于它，以便发现和理解它。结果是玩家更加专注，甚至可以说，手机被遗忘在一旁，因为他们专注于想出最佳解决方案来解决你提出的情况。有许多工具可用于提升你的游戏体验，从小型模型和地形到虚拟桌面和故事道具，但对我来说，让玩家完全投入其中的最佳技巧之一是新挑战的惊叹感—让他们保持警惕，乐趣将随之而来！",

	"When an NPC's statistics include the note \"Humanoid (Any Race)\" as the creature type, you can adjust those statistics as described in the {@table NPC Features|ToB3} table to create an NPC of the humanoid race detailed in the table.

	"To use the table, choose a set of NPC statistics, such as the {@creature apostle|ToB3}, and reference the Race column for the humanoid you want to rework as that NPC. The Ability Modifiers column details how to change the ability scores in the NPC statistics, and the Features column lists which features from the chosen race you should add to the chosen NPC statistics.

To create an {@creature avestruzii|ToB3} {@creature apostle|ToB3}, use the statistics of the {@creature apostle|ToB3} as the starting point. Increase the Constitution by 2 and the Strength by 1, increase its speed to 40 feet, and add the Terran language to its languages. In addition, the avestruzii apostle gains the Claw attack and Dig In reaction of the base {@creature avestruzii|ToB3}.": "使用表格时，选择一组NPC统计数据，比如{@creature apostle|ToB3}，并参考种族列，以确定要将其重新设计为该NPC的人形生物。能力修正列详细说明了如何更改NPC统计数据中的能力值，功能列列出了应该向所选NPC统计数据中添加哪些来自所选种族的特征。例如，一个{@creature avestruzii|ToB3}村庄可能包括一个{@creature apostle|ToB3}，帮助他们在战斗中的{@creature avestruzii champion|ToB3|champions}。要创建一个{@creature avestruzii|ToB3} {@creature apostle|ToB3}，请使用{@creature apostle|ToB3}的统计数据作为起点。将体质提高2点，力量提高1点，将其速度增加到40英尺，并将地灵语添加到其语言中。此外，avestruzii使徒获得了基础{@creature avestruzii|ToB3}的爪击和钻地反应。",
	"Adding new traits and features to a creature's statistics can increase the creature's Challenge Rating.

Their natural form is that of a mauve-skinned fiend the size of a halfling with the tell-tale backward hands of a {@creature rakshasa}.": "当一个{@creature rakshasa}在物质位面被杀死时，它的灵魂会被驱逐回地狱，在那里被恶魔折磨，直到它在一个新的身体中转世。有时，当它犯下严重错误导致死亡时，被杀的恶魔会以较低形态返回，被迫执行一系列邪恶行为，直到恢复其原来的地位。这些{@creature rakshasa||rakshasas}占据了标准等级体系之外的独特地位，被称为普斯塔卡姆（Pustakams）。与他们的同胞分开，普斯塔卡姆几乎完全居住在物质位面上，伪装成书籍、绘画或小雕像，混入凡人之中。它们的自然形态是一种紫红色皮肤的恶魔，体型像半身人，手掌朝后，具有{@creature rakshasa}的显著特征。",
	"To regain its former status as a full {@creature rakshasa}, the pustakam must tempt mortals into committing evil acts, and the severity of its failure determines the depth of the acts or how many mortals it must manipulate before it regains its power, which only the pustakam itself knows. Pustakams typically coerce victims into performing minor acts first, then push them into progressively more evil and depraved actions until the pustakam earns its return to the Hells, where it is reincarnated as a true {@creature rakshasa}.": "为了恢复作为一个完整{@creature rakshasa}的地位，普斯塔卡姆必须诱使凡人犯下邪恶行为，其失败的严重程度决定了行为的深度或者在恢复力量之前必须操纵多少凡人，只有普斯塔卡姆自己知道。普斯塔卡姆通常会强迫受害者先进行轻微的行为，然后将他们推向越来越邪恶和堕落的行动，直到普斯塔卡姆赢得重返地狱的机会，在那里它会转世为一个真正{@creature rakshasa}。",
	"The laborer class of the {@creature rakshasa}, called servitors, serve as the lowest rung in {@creature rakshasa} society. Minor functionaries, builders, and laborers, servitors possess a burning desire to advance. When a servitor proves itself worthy, elder {@creature rakshasa||rakshasas} perform the \"Unnati\" ritual. In this ritual, the servitor literally earns its stripes, transforming from a leopard-like fiend into a more powerful, tiger-like {@creature rakshasa}.": "{@creature rakshasa}中的劳工阶层，被称为仆从，是{@creature rakshasa}社会中最低的阶层。作为次要的官员、建筑工和劳动者，仆从们怀有一种强烈的进取心。当一个仆从证明自己是值得的时候，长者{@creature rakshasa||rakshasas}会进行“Unnati”仪式。在这个仪式中，仆从会真正地赢得自己的斑纹，从一个豹子般的恶魔变身为一个更强大的、像老虎一样的{@creature rakshasa}。",
	"When a {@creature rakshasa} or {@creature greater rakshasa|CCodex} needs an enemy spied upon or killed, it sends a slayer to carry out the mission. Slayers operate outside {@creature rakshasa} society to better protect themselves and their employers. They can assume dozens of identities and humanoid forms, switching identities as needed.": "当一个{@creature rakshasa}或{@creature greater rakshasa|CCodex}需要对敌人进行监视或杀戮时，它会派遣一个杀手来执行任务。杀手在{@creature rakshasa}社会之外运作，以更好地保护自己和雇主。他们可以扮演数十种身份和人形，根据需要切换身份。",
	"Swinging across on a rope to land on the enemy's deck, this stocky, blue-skinned humanoid brandishes a rapier with great panache.": "挥舞着绳索飞越到敌人的甲板上，这个矮胖、蓝皮肤的人形生物高高举起一把西洋剑，展现出极大的风度。",
	"The jinnborn are a race of wanderers found in the warm lands of the south. Descended from powerful elemental creatures called jinn, they claim to be the first mortals to have walked the world. Calling themselves the \"people of the path,\" they roam the desert lands, following the traditional routes set down by their elders. The jinnborn descend from varied elemental lineages, leading to air, earth, fire, and water jinnborn.": "炎热南方的流浪者种族是巨灵(jinn)之裔。他们自称是最早在世界上行走的凡人。他们称自己为“道之民”，漫游在沙漠之地，沿着长辈们设定的传统路线行走。巨灵(jinn)之裔源自不同元素血统，包括风、土、火和水巨灵(jinn)之裔。",
	"Many jinnborn find piracy and banditry match their nomadic lifestyle, allowing them to conduct lucrative raids on the ships and caravans they encounter while traveling their ancestral paths. Jinnborn that leave their people and paths find that life aboard a ship is familiar yet free from the traditions of their people. Those jinnborn who become pirates tend to be brash and flashy mavericks.": "许多（%num%）被发现海盗和强盗活动与他们游牧的生活方式相契合，使他们能够在沿途遇到的船只和商队上进行有利可图的袭击。那些离开自己人和路径的（jinnborn）发现，在船上的生活既熟悉又摆脱了他们人民的传统。那些成为海盗的（jinnborn）往往是性急而张扬的特立独行者。",
	"Earth and fire jinnborn tribes commonly use sandships to raid desert caravans, while air jinnborn prefer {@item airship||airships} powered by bound elementals or {@creature djinni||djinn}.

	"Monster hunters crave adventure and the thrill of the hunt. Each monster hunter specializes in slaying particular types of creatures. Some seek to rid the world of the danger the creatures present, while others seek the glory and renown slaying such creatures brings.

On occasion, monster hunters work together to take down a truly terrifying foe, sharing in the spoils and glory.": "怪物猎人渴望冒险和狩猎的刺激。每个怪物猎人专精于杀死特定类型的生物。有些人寻求消除这些生物带来的危险，而另一些人则追求杀死这些生物所带来的荣耀和声誉。怪物猎人小鬼没有官方组织，但他们几乎可以立刻认出彼此，边吃着老鼠串烤和麦酒边欢快地交换故事。偶尔，怪物猎人会联手对付一个真正可怕的敌人，分享战利品和荣耀。",
	"Ghost hunters seek to eradicate undead from the world, making the world safer for the living. Many make a living from it, while others are driven by a personal grudge. Either way, ghost hunters take their business seriously and do not respond well to those that interfere with their hunting.

These hunters typically carry other equipment useful in the fight against the undead, such as wooden stakes and holy water.": "捉鬼者寻求清除世界上的不死之灵，使世界对生者更加安全。许多人以此为生，而其他人则出于个人恩怨而行事。无论哪种情况，捉鬼者都认真对待他们的事业，并不会对那些干扰他们捕猎的人心存好感。每位捉鬼者都携带一件宗教圣物，藏在他们的眼罩后面，用来对敌人进行神圣打击。这些捉鬼者通常携带其他在与不死之灵作战中有用的装备，比如木桩和圣水。",
	"Leviathan hunters enjoy wrestling and defeating great sea creatures—the bigger the better. These bulky kobolds spend most of their lives on the sea, always searching for that next big haul. The right target—a sea dragon, an {@creature aboleth}, a {@creature sahuagin} outpost—can keep them and their companions living comfortably for many months. While these hunters frequently sign on with any ship looking for extra muscle, they typically end up captaining their own ship, giving them the freedom to chase down the monsters that others flee.": "利维坦猎人喜欢与海洋巨兽搏斗并将其打败——越大越好。这些笨重的狗头人大部分时间都在海上度过，总是在寻找下一个大收获。合适的目标——海龙、{@creature aboleth}、{@creature sahuagin}前哨站——可以让他们和伙伴们舒适地生活多个月。虽然这些猎人经常与任何需要额外力量的船只签约，但他们通常最终会担任自己船只的船长，这样他们就有自由追逐其他人逃避的怪物。",
	"Planes hunters delight in exploring every nook of the multiverse. They spend most of their lives hopping from plane to plane, always with a burning curiosity for what lies over the next horizon. They collect secrets and magical oddities, but each new treasure simply fuels their continued exploits, rarely staying in one place for long.

	"These despicable fiends pose as teachers and mentors, sometimes killing a known sage and taking their place. They willingly dole out wisdom to the worthy that seek their guidance, yet all the while, they lure their pupils into corruption. While all devils trade in souls, infernal tutors gain their greatest satisfaction in corrupting mortals who are seeking self-improvement. They revel in leading their ardent students into infernal mindsets under the guise of high-minded philosophies promoting the general good.": "这些可鄙的恶魔伪装成老师和导师，有时会杀死一位知名贤者并取而代之。他们乐意向寻求指导的有价值的人传授智慧，然而与此同时，他们诱使他们的学生堕落。虽然所有恶魔都在交易灵魂，但地狱导师最大的满足感来自腐蚀那些寻求自我提升的凡人。他们喜欢在高尚的哲学伪装下，引导他们热诚的学生走向地狱思维，宣扬追求普遍利益的高尚理念。",
	"Infernal tutors teach in remote and inaccessible places, such as forbidding mountaintops or atop lone mesas rising above the wilderness.

	"Infernal tutors implement their schemes with vast and deliberate patience. Those that question or rebel against their teachings are simply released from their tutelage.

Pike guards are dwarves armed with pikes, swathed in chain, and trained extensively in formation fighting. While not veterans, a mass of pike guards is a threat far greater than the sum of its parts.

	"Prismatic dragons bring light and color to the otherwise dark and gray underworld.

	"Like many dragons, prismatic dragons possess wings, but they can't sustain flight with their wings. Prismatic dragon wings have both the appearance and unwieldiness of stained glass. Fortunately, the dragons have no need to fly in most of their domain and their razor-sharp claws give them strong purchase to climb. The dragons' wings have a greater purpose than aesthetics—though they are vain about their appearance—because the dragons can tilt their wings to dazzle opponents to the point of blindness. As prismatic dragons age, their bodies shift in coloration from a dusty pink through an ever-expanding panoply of hues, including those invisible to most others.": "与许多龙类一样，（Prismatic Dragons）多彩龙拥有翅膀，但它们无法凭借翅膀飞行。多彩龙的翅膀既外观独特又笨重，就像彩色玻璃一样。幸运的是，这些龙在大部分领地中并不需要飞行，它们锋利的爪子让它们能够牢固地攀爬。这些龙的翅膀不仅仅是为了美观——虽然它们对自己的外表很自恋——因为这些龙可以倾斜它们的翅膀，让对手眩晕到失明的地步。随着多彩龙的年龄增长，它们的身体颜色会从浅粉色逐渐变化为一系列不断扩展的色彩，其中包括大多数其他生物看不见的颜色。",
	"Prismatic dragons tend crystals in their lair and in the surrounding territory. These crystal groves exhibit a riot of different shapes, sizes, and colors.

	"Of course, all this beauty serves no purpose if only the prismatic dragon can enjoy it. The dragon often welcomes subterranean guests or explorers from the upper world. It can't promise a comfortable stay for those who have difficulty sleeping on beds of crystals, but it attempts to accommodate food and drink requests within its means. This hospitality ends at undead creatures and conquest-driven groups. A prismatic dragon especially loathes {@creature adult cave dragon|ToB|cave dragons} and strives to eradicate the crystal-destroying pests if they move into the dragon's territory.": "当然，如果只有多彩龙能享受这一切美景，那么这一切美景就毫无意义。这只龙经常欢迎地下的客人或来自上层世界的探险者。对于那些在水晶床上难以入眠的人，它无法承诺一个舒适的住宿，但会尽力满足食物和饮料的要求。这种款待不包括不死生物和征服驱动的团体。多彩龙特别厌恶{@creature adult cave dragon|ToB|cave dragons}，并努力根除那些侵入龙领地的破坏水晶的害虫。",

	"A sand dragon's desire for isolation and the scarcity of available food renders it an irritable host at best. A dragon's first response upon noticing intruders rarely goes further than killing and eating them. Travelers who offer the dragon plenty of fresh meat stand a chance to pass through its domain unharmed. The sand dragon tolerates lesser creatures that inhabit the same land, such as {@creature sandwyrm|ToB|sandwyrms}, provided they don't compete for resources. It may bully these creatures to hunt on its behalf.": "一只沙龙渴望独居，而食物稀缺使其成为最好的暴躁主人。发现入侵者时，龙的第一反应很少超出杀死并吃掉他们。给予龙大量新鲜肉食的旅行者有机会安全通过其领地。沙龙容忍居住在同一土地上的较低级生物，比如{@creature sandwyrm|ToB|sandwyrms}，只要它们不争夺资源。它可能欺凌这些生物，让它们代表自己狩猎。",
	"Sand dragons express themselves through the medium of sand or similar materials in their lairs. Spiraling towers erupt from the ground, reaching dozens of feet in height and seeming on the verge of collapse. In the rare instances where the dragons decide to attack settlements, they commit the location to memory and duplicate the buildings as sand sculptures to near perfection. They often etch screaming faces in the walls of the buildings to commemorate the terror they unleashed during their attacks. Sand dragons also use sand to encase the remains of those who dared attack the dragons in their lairs, molding the sand to match the likenesses of the creatures when they were alive.": "沙龙通过沙子或类似材料在它们的巢穴中表达自己。螺旋塔楼从地面拔地而起，高达数十英尺，看起来快要倒塌。在极少数情况下，龙决定袭击定居点，它们会将位置牢记在心，并将建筑复制成几乎完美的沙雕。它们经常在建筑物的墙壁上刻上尖叫的面孔，以纪念它们在袭击中释放的恐怖。沙龙还会用沙子包裹那些曾经敢于攻击它们巢穴的人的遗骸，将沙子塑造成这些生物在活着时的样子。",
	"When tons of sand, silt, and other debris cover up the remains of forgotten kingdoms, they may slumber undisturbed for centuries.

	"Sand dragons live in areas with a plentitude of sand or other loose, course material. They can make themselves at home in deserts, salt flats, wastelands, and coastal dunes. Some sand dragons find convenient caves where they can dwell, but most dig deep below the surface, leaving a couple of well-supported tunnels where they can exit and enter. Piles of whatever common material they have in their lairs conceal these tunnels.": "沙龙生活在沙漠或其他松散的、粗糙的材料丰富的地区。它们可以在沙漠、盐沼、荒地和沿海沙丘中安家落户。一些沙龙会在方便的洞穴中居住，但大多数会深深地挖掘地下，留下几条有良好支撑的隧道，供它们出入。它们藏匿在巢穴中的隧道下面堆满了各种普通材料。",

This sense of pride easily turns into dangerous arrogance, preventing them from backing down from an aggressor.": "阿尔克斯（Alkes）,也被称为阿尔斯或基森（keythong）,是{@creature griffon||griffons}的近亲，但它们的背部长满刺而不是翅膀。在战斗中比典型的狮鹫更凶猛，阿尔克斯利用自己的体型和卓越的速度来击倒猎物，暴露出来以便用它们的压碎喙和撕裂利爪攻击。阿尔克斯是孤独的生物，太骄傲和易变，不愿与同类分享领地。它们总是认为自己处于食物链的顶端，即使更强大的野兽居住在附近。这种自豪感很容易转变成危险的傲慢，使它们不会向侵略者屈服。",
	"While alkes regard all beasts as prey, they bear an instinctual contempt for other monstrosities, including {@creature griffon||griffons} and other alkes. This contempt comes not from a sense of jealousy but rather the alke's pride in its own prowess.

	"Hala'ath, the Sentinel of Progress, guides the mortal peoples of the Material Plane into a glorious future. The archangel usually acts from afar, preferring to send its {@creature haladron|ToB3|haladrons} to guide and assist those who have requested aid from it. It believes progress due to direct intercession is not true advancement for the person or species requiring it. Hala'ath is viewed as aloof and impersonal, even by its peers.": "进步哨兵哈拉阿斯（Hala'ath）引导物质位面的凡人民族走向光明的未来。这位大天使通常远距离行动，更喜欢派遣它的{@creature haladron|ToB3|haladrons}来指导和协助那些请求帮助的人。它认为直接干预所导致的进步并不是真正的个人或物种进步。哈拉阿斯被视为冷漠和不近人情，即使在同行中也是如此。",
	"Hala'ath is a patron of inventors and builders, but its portfolio also includes societal advancement. The archangel sees all thinking creatures as equal in the eyes of the gods of goodness and order, and it stands in firm opposition to creatures exhibiting narrow or regressive thinking. Hala'ath is more likely to appear on the Material Plane in places where oppression has overcome reason than it is to intervene in a place where technology has gone awry.": "哈拉阿斯 (Hala'ath) 是发明家和建筑师的守护者，但其职责范围也包括社会进步。这位大天使将所有有思想的生物视为善良和秩序之神眼中的平等存在，并坚决反对表现出狭隘或倒退思维的生物。在材质位面上，哈拉阿斯更有可能出现在压迫战胜理性的地方，而不太可能干预技术出现问题的地方。",

They rarely make suggestions, favoring the exploration of an idea over the final execution. {@creature haladron|ToB3|Haladrons} can be encountered {@i en masse} in Gyrespring Fortress, where they tirelessly carry out Hala'ath's dictates.": "哈拉阿斯（Hala'ath）最喜爱的仆从，{@creature haladron|ToB3|haladrons}，看起来像一个带有一对钢翼的有齿齿轮。每个哈拉德隆（haladron）身体中央有一只不眨眼的钢制眼睛。在物质位面，{@creature haladron|ToB3|haladrons}经常被派去协助发明家和活动家。它们很少提出建议，更喜欢探索一个想法而不是最终执行。{@creature haladron|ToB3|Haladrons}可以在环泉要塞（Gyrespring Fortress）中遇到，那里它们不知疲倦地执行哈拉阿斯的命令。",

	"A raging sphere of golden flame roils above the battlefield, dozens of giant arms reaching out from it.

Motes of golden flame orbit the archangel's central mass, speeding along their trajectories while it is motionless and slowing down as it moves about the battlefield.": "一团熊熊的金色火焰在战场上方翻滚，数十只巨大的手臂从中伸出。这些手臂时而变换形态，代表着各种人形生物和巨人。金色火焰的微粒围绕着大天使的中心质量运动，当它静止时，微粒沿着轨迹高速运动，而当它在战场上移动时则减速。",
	"Iilari'jil (Eel-ARR-ee-yell), the Fire of Forgotten Hope, is a patron of the besieged and warriors who have lost hope. They are an active celestial that appears frequently on the Material Plane, though their visits rarely last longer than a minute. Iilari'jil is more widely known than many archangels due to the frequency of their appearances and has gained more popularity as a result. They have more mortal adherents than most of their peers, and they have inspired entire orders of righteous warriors devoted to the cause of breaking sieges and delivering the good and innocent from hopeless-seeming situations.": "Iilari'jil（Eel-ARR-ee-yell）,被遗忘希望之火，是被围困者和失去希望的战士的守护神。他们是一位活跃的天神，在物质位面上频繁出现，尽管他们的访问很少超过一分钟。Iilari'jil比许多大天使更广为人知，因为他们出现的频率更高，因此也更受欢迎。他们拥有比大多数同行更多的凡人信徒，并激发了整个正义战士团的成立，致力于打破围困并拯救那些陷入绝望境地的善良和无辜者。",
	"Though primarily viewed as a celestial of battles and warfare, Iilari'jil hears the pleas and prayers of all mortals who are under siege. They are as likely to assist in ending the unjust blockade of a busy harbor as they are to help a single mortal trying to protect her home from invaders.

	"Numerous mortals have taken up the mantle of Iilari'jil in order to do good works in their name, either as individuals or by forming an organization with like-minded people. While they are uncommon, some barbarians pay homage to the Fire of Forgotten Hope, favoring paths that imbue them with divine energy or empower their allies against hopeless situations. {@class bard||Bards} of Iilari'jil favor colleges that teach the art of war or that promote acts of valor, and they often join organizations where they can support soldiers on battlefields. {@class cleric||Clerics} rarely gain power directly from Iilari'jil, but many {@class cleric||clerics} of goodly gods of war and protection call for the archangel's favor in battle.": "许多凡人承担了Iilari'jil的职责，以他们的名义做善事，无论是作为个人还是与志同道合的人组成组织。虽然他们并不常见，但一些野蛮人向遗忘希望之火致敬，偏爱赋予他们神圣能量或增强他们的盟友对抗绝望局面的路径。{@class bard||Bards}的Iilari'jil偏好教授战争艺术或提倡英勇行为的学院，并经常加入可以在战场上支援士兵的组织。{@class cleric||Clerics}很少直接从Iilari'jil获得力量，但许多{@class cleric||clerics}的战争和保护之神在战斗中寻求大天使的青睐。",

	"Iilari'jil is rarely afforded time to rest and doesn't have a devoted home in the Upper Planes. Iilari'jil treats whatever battlefield they are fighting on as their lair, and their sheer presence has a dramatic effect on the landscape.": "Iilari'jil 很少有时间休息，在(上层位面)没有一个专属的家。Iilari'jil 将他们正在战斗的战场视为他们的巢穴，他们的存在对景观有着戏剧性的影响。",
	"A massive serpent appears with gleaming copper scales and eyes of emerald green. From its back unfold six pairs of feathered wings that shine a pearlescent white.": "一条巨大的蛇出现了，它身披闪亮的铜鳞，眼睛翠绿如翡翠。从它的背上展开了六对羽翼，闪耀着珍珠般的白色光芒。",
	"Kalkydra are loyal servants and emissaries of solar deities. Their joyous songs herald the dawning of each day, and their melancholy refrains echo in the heavens as the sun sets each evening.

Unless they are set to a specific task, they range far and wide to assist stranded mariners, troubled aquatic communities, and beleaguered sea life. Except in the case of fiends, pelagic devas assess each intelligent creature they encounter as an individual and don't condemn whole crews or communities for the evil actions of individual members.": "深洋天人以其愉快和健谈的态度而闻名，只有当他们遇到那些喜欢他人痛苦的生物时，他们才会保持沉默或露出严肃表情。除非他们被指定执行特定任务，否则他们会四处游走，帮助搁浅的水手、困扰的水下社区和备受困扰的海洋生物。除了邪恶生物，深洋天人会将他们遇到的每个智能生物视为一个个体，并不会因为个别成员的邪恶行为而谴责整个船员团队或社区。",

	"With eons of time to pass, zirnitran angels study the entire breadth of draconic history, including the creation and use of magic. This understanding of powerful magical forces fosters a deep-seated distrust of the zirnitra in their celestial brethren. Many celestials believe their knowledge and mastery of magic border dangerously close to blasphemy, but the zirnitra have yet to overstep their bounds or use their knowledge to defy the gods. Some celestials suspect the gods allow the zirnitran angels to retain their mastery so they might better aid the eldest dragon when it wakes from its slumber and commences the end of times.": "随着漫长的时间流逝，(Zirnitran)天使们研究了整个龙族历史的广度，包括魔法的创造和运用。对强大魔法力量的理解培养了他们对天界同胞的根深蒂固的不信任。许多天界生物认为，他们对魔法的知识和掌握接近亵渎，但(Zirnitra)天使们尚未越过界限，也没有利用他们的知识来违抗神灵。一些天界生物怀疑神灵允许(Zirnitran)天使保留他们的掌握，以便在最古老的龙苏醒并开始末日时更好地帮助它。",

	"Truly magnificent works of art and sorcery, animated symphonies are massive swarms of animated instruments. The magic required to uplift entire symphonies is both mighty and rare.

Lastly, when a supplicant is ready to accept the bannik's divination, it must bare its back to the bannik.

The ghostly dwarf 's eyes glow a bright blue as she glares around her throne room, the sounds of mournful dead echoing around her.": "一名矮人坐在一把被一层冰覆盖的石头宝座上，她的皮肤呈苍白蓝色，神情饱受折磨。她手持一把雕刻着发光蓝色符文的冰 {@item maul|phb}，头顶上戴着一顶锈迹斑斑的金色王冠。这位幽灵矮人的眼睛闪着明亮的蓝光，她怒视着自己的宝座室，哀伤的亡者的声音在周围回荡。",
	"Long ago, a kingdom in the frozen north had a ruler who was too young to lead a kingdom. A regent was appointed to guide the land until the rightful ruler came of age. Unfortunately, the regent's actions brought a terrible tragedy to the land, leading to the death of the rightful ruler and many of the kingdom's people. Though the kingdom fell, the regent remained after death, cursed to lead the damned souls of the people as punishment for failing to protect them in life.": "很久以前，北方冰冻之地的一个王国有一个年幼无法领导王国的统治者。一个摄政王被任命来指导这片土地，直到合适的统治者成年为止。不幸的是，摄政王的行动给这片土地带来了可怕的悲剧，导致了合适的统治者和许多王国人民的死亡。尽管王国已经倒塌，但摄政王在死后仍然留在那里，被诅咒领导着人们的灵魂，作为未能在生前保护他们而受到的惩罚。",
	"The forgotten regent has been cursed to lead a kingdom of the damned in the frozen reaches of the world. The kingdom's people have risen as undead creatures that follow the regent. Though its subjects are now undead, the regent takes its job as leader and protector as seriously as when its subjects were alive. It reacts with violence against intruders and with diplomacy toward those requesting a meeting. During times of great need, heroes and villains have been known to seek the aid of the forgotten regent. The regent's undead army could turn the tide of any battle, but the regent doesn't send its citizens to battle carelessly.": "被遗忘的摄政者被诅咒，领导着一个位于世界冰冻之地的被诅咒王国。王国的人民已经变成了不死生物，跟随着这位摄政者。尽管它的臣民现在是不死之身，但摄政者对待领导者和保护者的工作一丝不苟，就像当它的臣民还活着时一样认真。它对入侵者采取暴力反应，对请求会面的人采取外交手段。在极需之时，英雄和恶棍们常常寻求被遗忘的摄政者的帮助。摄政者的不死军队可以扭转任何战斗的局势，但摄政者并不轻易将其公民送上战场。",
	"The curse upon the kingdom is tied to the regent. Should the regent be defeated, the curse lifts, allowing the souls of the kingdom's people to seek eternal rest, and allowing the kingdom to fully fade into history as the remaining structures crumble. Some regents long for this end, knowing it is the only way to truly save their people, while others fight it, knowing their continued existence is the only thing keeping the kingdom's legacy alive.": "王国上的诅咒与摄政王有关。一旦摄政王被打败，诅咒将解除，王国人民的灵魂将得以永恒安息，王国也将在剩余建筑崩塌的过程中完全消失在历史中。一些摄政王渴望这种结局，因为他们知道这是唯一真正拯救人民的方法，而另一些则在与之抗争，因为他们知道他们的继续存在是保持王国遗产活着的唯一方式。",
	"Forgotten regents can be found in any remote, arctic location or cold mountaintop with enough land for a small fallen kingdom's fort, castle, or former seat of power. Locations like the Duchy of Domovogrod, where Thursir giants have sacked and conquered territory, or the forgotten halls of ancient clans of the Northlands, such as those found in and around Aurvang, Issedon, or Nordheim, make perfect locations for a forgotten regent.": "在任何偏远、北极地区或寒冷山顶都可能找到被遗忘的统治者，只要有足够的土地建造一个小型倒塌王国的要塞、城堡或前权力中心。像多莫沃格公国（Duchy of Domovogrod）这样的地方，那里的瑟西尔巨人（Thursir giants）已经洗劫并征服了领土，或者像北地古族的被遗忘大厅，比如在奥尔万（Aurvang）、伊瑟顿（Issedon）或诺德海姆（Nordheim）附近发现的那些，都是寻找被遗忘的统治者的完美场所。",
	"Forgotten regents inhabit ruined forts and castles deep in the frozen reaches of the arctic or high in rugged, cold mountains. A perpetual wind in and around the lair chills the living, ensuring the regent's solitude, and the outskirts of the lair features the remains of a great kingdom, such as ruined buildings, fallen sculptures, broken cobblestones, or similar remnants.": "在北极的废弃堡垒和城堡深处，或是高耸险峻、寒冷的山脉中，居住着被遗忘的统治者。巢穴周围的永久风吹拂着生灵，确保了统治者的孤独，而巢穴外围则布满了一个伟大王国的遗迹，如废墟建筑、倒塌雕像、破碎的鹅卵石等。",

	"Diomedian horses are carnivorous equines that gather in herds, hunting and devouring beasts and other creatures smaller than them. Their claws and powerful jaws are suited to tearing and rending flesh, though diomedians can subsist on vegetation for short periods of time if no meat is available.": "迪奥米德马是食肉的马科动物，它们聚集成群，狩猎并吞食比它们小的野兽和其他生物。它们的爪子和强大的下颚适合撕裂和撕咬肉食，尽管在没有肉类可供时，迪奥米德马也可以短时间地以植物为食。",
	"Diomedian horses have never been domesticated on a large scale. Their demeanor is too fierce and they cooperate only with others of their kind. In rare cases, very young diomedians have been trained to bear a rider but most such attempts fail. A trained diomedian will only ever accept a single rider, returning to the wild if that rider is ever lost or dies. Trainers with the skill to teach such a beast are rare and expensive to hire, but such a mount does confer great prestige.": "迪奥梅德马从未被大规模驯化。它们的性情过于凶猛，只与同类合作。在极少数情况下，非常年幼的迪奥梅德马被训练成可承载骑手，但大多数尝试都会失败。一个经过训练的迪奥梅德马只会接受一个骑手，如果那个骑手丢失或死亡，它将回归野外。有能力训练这样一种野兽的训练师很少，雇佣他们也很昂贵，但拥有这样一匹坐骑会带来极大的声望。",
	"Given the fierce reputation these creatures have, some societies consider it a mark of skill and bravery for a hunter or warrior of their culture kill or capture a diomedian horse. Those that do are often rewarded with a special rank or exceptional gift.": "鉴于这些生物的凶猛声誉，一些社会认为，对于他们文化中的猎人或战士来说，杀死或捕获一匹迪奥梅德战马是技艺和勇气的象征。那些成功的人通常会获得特殊的头衔或非凡的礼物。",
	"Giant ants made of dirt and stone climb out of a hole in the ground, while the clusters of ferns, grasses, and flowering vines on their backs sway with their movements.": "巨大的由泥土和石头构成的蚂蚁从地洞中爬出来，它们背上的蕨类植物、草和开花的藤蔓随着它们的动作摇摆着。",

	"Intelligent, curious, and social, mrymex love to explore, meet new creatures, and learn new things. Their colonies are welcome to all—so long as no one is intentionally harmed—leaving them with no notion of private or political boundaries. Myrmex young are encouraged to become companions to other explorers to better enrich the colony on their return.": "聪明、好奇和善社交，蚁人(mrymex)喜欢探索、结识新生物并学习新事物。它们的群落对所有生物敞开大门——只要没有人受到故意伤害——这使得它们没有私人或政治边界的概念。蚁人的幼崽被鼓励成为其他探险者的伴侣，以便在归来时更好地丰富群落。",
	"Myrmex superficially resemble ants but have notable differences. They don't have a hierarchy, and they have neither a queen nor castes. Instead, all are equal, and if a colony maintains at least twelve myrmex, it can elevate a speaker. The speaker is a myrmex that is imbued with power by the colony—a power that can be revoked in the rare instances the speaker works against the desires of the colony a whole. The speaker becomes the myrmex's voice to other cultures and enacts the will of the colony after each member has voted on a decision.": "蚁人(Myrmex)在外表上类似于蚂蚁，但有明显的区别。它们没有等级制度，既没有女王也没有不同的阶层。相反，它们都是平等的，如果一个群体至少有十二只蚁人，它就可以提拔一名发言者。这个发言者是由整个群体赋予力量的蚁人——一种力量，在极少数情况下，如果发言者违背了整个群体的意愿，这种力量可以被收回。发言者成为蚁人对其他文化的代言人，并在每个成员投票决定后执行群体的意愿。",
	"Rather than lay eggs, adult myrmex sculpt their young from dirt, stone, earth from their own bodies, and rare minerals. These minerals prove a limiting factor to a colony's growth because the required minerals and their proportions are precise. This need for rare minerals frequently puts them at odds with roaming {@creature xorn}, who enjoy consuming many of those same minerals.": "成年蚁人不是产卵，而是用泥土、石头、自身的土壤和稀有矿物质来雕塑他们的幼崽。这些矿物质对一个群落的增长构成了限制因素，因为所需的矿物质及其比例是精确的。对稀有矿物质的需求经常使它们与漫游的{@creature xorn}产生冲突，后者喜欢消耗同样的许多矿物质。",
	"Myrmex make allies easily, but they don't tend to swear fealty to anyone, especially elemental lords, which often makes their colonies a target for other elementals. They are loyal friends, and such friendship can last for generations. For instance, many myrmex have been friends of the {@creature pech|CCodex} for millennia, and some myrmex even share colonies with them. However, no myrmex colony has ever sworn fealty to a {@creature pech lithlord|CCodex}, and some colonies have even broken away from their pech allies when a lithlord has tried to rule or command the myrmex.": "蚁兽(Myrmex)很容易结交盟友，但他们不倾向于向任何人宣誓效忠，尤其是元素领主，这经常使他们的殖民地成为其他元素生物的目标。他们是忠诚的朋友，这种友谊可以持续几代人。例如，许多蚁兽已经与{@creature pech|CCodex}交友数千年，甚至有些蚁兽与他们共享殖民地。然而，没有任何蚁兽殖民地曾向{@creature pech lithlord|CCodex}宣誓效忠，有些殖民地甚至在岩领主试图统治或命令蚁兽时与他们的矮妖盟友决裂。",
	"Warlocks of the genie lord gain their power through magical pacts forged with powerful {@creature djinni} and {@creature efreeti} lords. These warlocks often summon lesser elementals to do their bidding, and regardless of their alignment, they exude a commanding presence and an air of superiority.": "精灵领主的术士通过与强大的{@creature djinni}和{@creature efreeti}领主达成的魔法契约获得他们的力量。这些术士经常召唤次要元素来执行他们的命令，无论他们的立场如何，他们都散发出一种威严的气质和优越感。",

	"Rafflesian flowers, even without a host creature, live for up to three centuries and germinate only one seed each century.

	"With mighty tusks, claws, and a trumpeting blast, yali are steadfastly loyal guardian constructs. Some variants have the heads of tusked horses or dogs, and while they may bellow or bark rather than bugle, such differences are purely cosmetic.": "拥有强大的獠牙、利爪和发出象声的喇叭声，亚力(Yali)是坚定忠诚的守护构造体。一些变种可能有长着獠牙的马或狗的头部，虽然它们可能会吼叫或吠叫而不是吹号角，但这些差异纯粹是装饰性的。",
	"Priests and abbots employ extended rituals to craft packs of yali dedicated to protecting holy sites. Created as stoic and incorruptible defenders of a sacred temple or a sprawling monastery, they are most commonly found in tropical environments. Yali can stand perfectly still, mimicking carved pillars or gate ornaments, awaiting the command to leap into action and repel bandits, heretics, or enemy soldiers.": "（牧师）和（修道院院长）们采用了漫长的仪式来制作一批专门用于保护圣地的（亚利）。它们被创造成坚忍不拔、不可腐蚀的圣殿或广阔寺院的守护者，最常见于热带环境中。（亚利）可以静静地站着，模仿雕刻的柱子或门饰，等待命令，随时准备跃动并击退强盗、异端者或敌军。",
	"Despite being smaller than a horse, the yali's great strength means they can, and occasionally do, act as mounts for the faithful of a particular temple. Sometimes this service is temporary to ensure important messengers arrive unharmed, while other times they are given as gifts to those who have performed a great deed for the institution. They can easily carry a single {@race human} or two {@race halfling||halflings} and don't tire as a horse does, making them prized among professional couriers.": "尽管比马小，但雅力(Yali)的强大力量意味着它们可以，有时候确实会，作为某座寺庙的信徒的坐骑。有时这种服务是临时的，以确保重要信使平安抵达，而有时它们会被赠送给为该机构做出伟大贡献的人。它们可以轻松地携带一个{@race human}或两个{@race halfling||halflings}人，不像马那样容易疲劳，因此在专业信使中备受珍视。",

	"Building a godslayer requires the finest materials, such as {@variantrule adamantine weapons|XGE|adamantine}, {@item mithral armor||mithral}, and other more exotic metals.

	"When not actively hunting or fighting its divine prey, a godslayer tends to stand motionless, waiting for its long-reaching senses to detect its next target. This has led to many mistaking a godslayer for an ornate statue or nonfunctional construct.": "当不在积极狩猎或与其神圣猎物战斗时，一名（godslayer）（神杀者）往往会静立不动，等待其远程感知器官探测到下一个目标。这导致许多人错误地将（godslayer）（神杀者）误认为是一座精美的雕像或无功能的构造物。",

Such conflicts can escalate quickly, however, as neither side really considers the collateral damage to the homes and property of the mortals they're fighting among. Brownies tend to fear hags and {@creature ala|ToB|alas}, who find the tiny brownies to be a prized delicacy. When an ala or hag is in an area, brownies will band together to chase off the creature (or ask a mortal adventurer to do it). Brownies are tricksy and love a good prank; however, they never allow a prank to do permanent harm, unless the target of their shenanigans responds with violence. They can appreciate when a mortal attempts to outwit them, respecting such attempts.": "棕色妖精强烈厌恶{@creature alp|CCodex|alps}和{@creature morko|CCodex|morkos}，认为它们都是巨大的粗鲁家伙和令人沮丧的扫兴者。通过适当的贿赂或非常有效的口头操纵，可以诱使棕色妖精进入这些受这些精灵折磨的社区，并试图将它们赶走。然而，这种冲突可能会迅速升级，因为双方都没有真正考虑到他们在战斗中对凡人的家园和财产造成的附带损害。棕色妖精倾向于害怕女巫和{@creature ala|ToB|alas}，后者发现这些微小的棕色妖精是珍贵的美食。当有阿拉或女巫出现在一个地区时，棕色妖精会团结起来驱赶这个生物（或请求一个凡人冒险者来做）。棕色妖精爱恶作剧；然而，他们绝不会让恶作剧造成永久伤害，除非他们恶作剧的目标以暴力回应。他们会欣赏凡人试图智胜他们的举动，并尊重这种尝试。",
	"Occasionally, a brownie adopts a residence and its people, living among the rafters, beneath the stairs, or even in a cozy crawlspace. The brownie coexists with the family while performing small tasks, like cleaning or repairing objects in exchange for gifts of bread, milk, honey, or even small trinkets or handkerchiefs. Brownies dislike braggarts, however, and any mortal who boasts about having a brownie living in their home soon finds they've been abandoned.": "偶尔，一只布朗尼会选择一个住所和它的居民一起生活，它们可能住在横梁上、楼梯底下，甚至是一个舒适的爬行空间里。布朗尼与家人和睦相处，同时会做一些小事，比如清洁或修理物品，作为交换会收到面包、牛奶、蜂蜜，甚至小饰品或手帕作为礼物。然而，布朗尼不喜欢自吹自擂的人，任何夸耀家里有布朗尼的凡人很快就会发现它们已经离开了。",
	"Atavists are cultists who believe the secrets of the universe reside within the body. With fell rites of blood magic, they tap into the legacies of their forgotten ancestors and turned their bodies into living weapons. Atavists turn their fingernails into blades, their bones into lethal projectiles, and their bodies into forms perfectly suited to their environments.": "原始主义者是一群信奉宇宙奥秘存在于身体内的异教徒。通过血腥魔法的邪恶仪式，他们接触到了被遗忘祖先的传承，将自己的身体变成了活生生的武器。原始主义者将自己的指甲变成刀刃，骨骼变成致命的投射物，将身体塑造成完美适应环境的形态。",
	"While rarely spellcasters, atavists rely on {@creature blood mage|CCodex|blood mages} to unlock their powers. The least stable atavists are functionally thralls, unable to survive in their altered state without regular transfusions of blood or arcane stabilization.

	"Lobe lemurs are known for what they eat: the brains of other creatures. Due to their small size, they typically feast on birds and rodents, but they'll eat any brain matter they can get. They use their jagged front teeth to consume a victim's eyes before using their elongated claws to scoop out the now-accessible brain matter. If given the opportunity, the lobe lemur happily ambushes a larger creature, clinging to the creature's head to get at its brains. Some scholars speculate they grow more intelligent with each brain they eat, leading to some particularly smart elder lobe lemurs that command whole packs of the creatures. However, none who have seen such a colony have lived to tell the tale.": "卢贝狐猴以吃什么而闻名：其他生物的大脑。由于它们体型较小，通常以食鸟和啮齿动物为食，但它们会吃任何大脑物质。它们利用锯齿状的门齿来吃掉受害者的眼睛，然后利用它们的延长爪子来舀出现在易接触的大脑物质。如果有机会，卢贝狐猴会高兴地伏击一只更大的生物，紧贴在生物的头部以获取其大脑。一些学者推测，它们每吃一个大脑就会变得更聪明，导致一些特别聪明的老年卢贝狐猴控制着整群这些生物。然而，看到这样一个群落的人都没有活着讲述这个故事。",
	"Weld the front half of an iron horse to a small, patchwork plow, add short blades on either side of the plow, and either a farmer or a necromancer is ready to harvest.": "将一匹铁马的前半部焊接到一个小型拼接犁上，两侧加上短刃，这样一个农夫或一个(死灵术士)就可以准备好收割了。",
	"Harvest horses are patchwork constructs made as autonomous plows and crop-harvesters. They are forged from scrap iron and broken farming equipment, reassembled by a village blacksmith, then enchanted by apprentices or local mystics. The resulting constructs vary wildly in cost, appearance, and functionality but take the form of an iron horse bolted to a plow or wagon.": "收割马是拼接构造，被制作成自主犁地和收割作物的工具。它们由废铁和破旧农业设备锻造而成，由村庄铁匠重新组装，然后由学徒或当地秘术师施加魔法。最终产生的构造物在成本、外观和功能上变化极大，但通常采取铁马固定在犁或马车上的形式。",
	"Harvest horses are far less sophisticated than the intricate creations favored by nobles or powerful spellcasters. While still expensive for a farmer, their makeshift construction and their animating enchantments means that a good harvest, a reasonable investment, or a loan is often enough to commission one. Once purchased, a harvest horse performs the work of an {@creature ox|MPMM}, horse, or {@item donkey|phb} without needing food or sleep, getting sick, dying of old age, or being eaten by wolves and monsters. Even a damaged and destroyed harvest horse can be repaired relatively simply. Maintaining a harvest horse can mean the difference between a family slowly losing what little it has and real stability.": "收割马远不如贵族或强大法师青睐的复杂创造物那般精致。虽然对农民来说仍然昂贵，但它们的临时建造和魔法附魔意味着一个丰收、一个合理的投资或一笔贷款通常足以委托制作一个。一旦购买，一个收割马可以执行{@creature ox|MPMM}、马或{@item donkey|phb}的工作，而无需食物或睡眠，也不会生病、因年老而死亡，或被狼和怪物吃掉。即使受损或被摧毁，收割马也可以相对简单地修复。维护一个收割马可能意味着一个家庭逐渐失去所拥有的一切和真正的稳定之间的区别。",
	"The harvest horse's simplicity works against it. Harvest horses lack the sophistication of their more expensive counterparts and are more prone to malfunction. They require more supervision than an {@creature ox|MPMM}, because they can't navigate broken terrain, lack even bestial intelligence, occasionally fail to recognize commands, and misidentify fences, clumps of dirt, or living things as crops. Without frequent repair or adjustments, a malfunctioning harvest horse can become as much of a threat as a pack of {@creature wolf||wolves}.": "收割马的简单性反而成为它的劣势。与更昂贵的同类相比，收割马缺乏复杂性，更容易出现故障。它们需要比{@creature ox|MPMM}更多的监督，因为它们无法穿越崎岖地形，甚至缺乏野兽般的智慧，有时无法识别命令，会错误地将围栏、土块或生物误认为庄稼。如果不经常维修或调整，一个发生故障的收割马可能会变得像一群{@creature wolf||wolves}一样具有威胁性。",
	"Not all who build or buy a harvest horse have good intentions. A harvest horse may not be a capable combatant, but it can drag an enormous load and is more durable than most living livestock. Bandits, town militias, necromancers, and desperate adventurers have been known to steal these constructs, hitch wagons to them, and use them as an improvised chariot or as a tool in grave-robbing. The most ambitious attach small ballista to them, while the more restrained use them as a disruptive and unreliable form of heavy cavalry.": "并非所有建造或购买收割马的人都怀有善意。收割马可能不是一个出色的战斗者，但它可以拉动巨大的负载，比大多数活体家畜更耐用。强盗、镇上的民兵、死灵法师和绝望的冒险者曾被发现偷走这些构造物，将马车套在它们身上，将它们用作临时战车或盗墓工具。最雄心勃勃的人会在它们身上安装小型弩炮，而更为克制的人会将它们用作一种混乱且不可靠的重型骑兵。",

	"Mudmutts are big, frog-like canines that hunt insects and waterfowl in bogs, marshes, and swamps. Their powerful hind legs can propel them through thick mud, and their wide mouths can bellow with mangroveshaking force. This impressive croak is dangerously painful and can be deadly if experienced underwater. A tongue stretchy and sticky tongue lolls in their big mouths. Mudmutts earned their name from the mud that cakes their coats after a full day of hunting. This heavy coating never seems to bother them and often helps them blend in with their surroundings.": "泥犬兽是大型、类似青蛙的犬科动物，它们在沼泽、湿地和沼泽地捕猎昆虫和水禽。它们强壮的后腿可以让它们在浓稠的泥土中迅速移动，宽阔的嘴巴可以发出摇曳着红树林的力量的吼声。这种令人印象深刻的呱呱声具有危险性，如果在水下经历过，可能会致命。它们大嘴里有一条伸缩粘性的舌头。泥犬兽因为在一整天的狩猎后身上沾满泥巴而得名。这层厚重的覆盖物似乎从不困扰它们，通常还帮助它们与周围环境融为一体。",
	"When stumbling across a mudmutt in the wild, one must be careful and deliberate.

	"Scarsupials normally feast on birds, squirrels, and small monkeys, but their favorite prey are slow-moving ground-dwelling creatures, who rarely see them coming. Colonies of scarsupials will coordinate ambushes on larger prey, waiting until their target is within range before dropping down on the creature. If the colony brings down large prey, it drags the body up into the canopy and leisurely feasts on the remains.

	"Megantereons are more commonly called daggertooth cats in the Midlands and lokotunjal in the Southlands. Most roam the grasslands of the Abandoned Lands, where they share their hunting grounds with saber-toothed tigers and other dinosaur predators. Some daggertooth cats can be found on the Rothenian Plains and the Red Wastes. A slain megantereon was recently found in the Goblin Wastes, but the tentacle-like growths extending from its shoulders suggest it may have been a warped by chaos magic or tainted by the Void. A noted naturalist in Bemmea has offered a substantial reward for the recovery of a live daggertooth from the Wastes.": "在米德兰地区，Megantereons更常被称为daggertooth cats，在南地区被称为lokotunjal。大多数漫游于废弃之地的草原，与剑齿虎和其他恐龙掠食者分享狩猎领地。一些daggertooth cats可以在Rothenian Plains和Red Wastes找到。最近在Goblin Wastes发现了一只被杀死的megantereon，但从其肩膀延伸出来的触手状生长暗示它可能被混沌魔法扭曲或被虚空污染。Bemmea的一位著名自然学家为从废土中找回一只活着的daggertooth提供了丰厚的奖励。",

Khamaseens are especially attracted to iron and focus their destruction on creatures wielding metal weapons and wearing metal armor.": "卡马辛（Khamaseens）只出现在干旱地区，比如台地布满的荒地或炎热干燥的沙漠。即使被咒术师召唤，他们也只会在适合它们的地形下出现。一旦出现，卡马辛就是毁灭的旋风。他们几乎有着孩子般的渴望，想要摧毁他们路径上的一切，他们会特意寻找生物战斗和摧毁物品。卡马辛尤其吸引于铁制品，并将破坏焦点放在持有金属武器和穿着金属盔甲的生物身上。",
	"Sages and naturalists have hypothesized that each individual khamaseen is a tiny portion of a composite elemental titan that resides on the border of the Plane of Air and Plane of Earth. Visitors to those elemental regions report a perpetually churning sandstorm does often seems to break off smaller dust devils that investigate disturbances or other creatures.": "贤者和自然学家们推测，每个(`%num%`)卡马辛都是一个驻留在空气位面和地球位面边界的复合元素泰坦的微小部分。前往这些元素区域的访客报告称，一个永远翻滚的沙尘暴经常会产生较小的尘旋，这些尘旋似乎会调查干扰或其他生物。",
	"A silvery breastplate gleams under robes of sable velvet and snowwhite silk. Beneath arching black brows, the elf 's sea-green eyes miss nothing.": "一件银色胸甲在黑色天鹅绒和雪白丝绸的长袍下闪闪发光。在拱形的黑眉下，精灵的海绿色眼睛无所不见。",
	"Though the life broker holds the respect of all fey folk, it rarely treats with its own kind. Instead, it looks to mortals, as they are both product and consumer for its trade—the buying and selling of lifetimes, in whole or in part.": "尽管生命经纪人赢得了所有精灵民族的尊重，它很少与自己的同类打交道。相反，它将目光投向凡人，因为他们既是其交易的产品又是消费者——购买和出售生命，无论是全部还是部分。",
	"Those who seek the life broker do so for two reasons: to trade some of their remaining life for valuables or to purchase more life for themselves. Many of those willing to sell their life do so to secure enough money to aid a loved one, while those seeking to extend their lives are often the rich, powerful, or influential. The life broker can be convinced to take other forms of payment, such as memories of a loved one, a particular talent for song, or similar esoteric valuables, depending on the amount of life the petitioner wishes in exchange.": "寻求生命经纪人的人通常有两个原因：要用剩余的生命换取贵重物品，或者为自己购买更多生命。许多愿意出售生命的人这样做是为了获得足够的钱来帮助所爱之人，而那些寻求延长生命的人通常是富有、有权势或有影响力的人。生命经纪人可以被说服接受其他形式的付款，比如所爱之人的记忆、一种特殊的歌唱才能，或者类似的神秘财宝，具体取决于请愿者希望换取的生命数量。",
	"The life broker never takes what is not offered to it, following unspoken rules set by some unknown entity when the first life brokers appeared. However, those who attack the broker are assumed to be willing to give up their lives. The lives of those the broker defeats in self defense become the broker's to do with as it chooses.": "生命经纪人从不拿走未被提供的东西，遵循着某个未知实体设定的不成文规则，当第一批生命经纪人出现时。然而，那些攻击经纪人的人被认为是愿意牺牲自己的生命。在自卫中被经纪人打败的人的生命成为经纪人自行处理的对象。",
	"A cluster of tiny rock-like shells wait, attached to a floating barrel. Blood stains the water, and the red and black beaks open, revealing small tendrils that taste at the blood and pull the barnacles toward its source.": "一簇微小如岩石般的贝壳聚集在一个漂浮的桶上等待。水中染着血迹，红色和黑色的喙张开，露出小触须舔着血液，并将带着的藤壶拉向其来源。",
	"Found on ships, reefs, rocks, and old piers, these corrupted barnacles are by no means natural. Often gathered in groupings of five to ten, a blood barnacle infestation can prove to be a threat for any crew, particularly injured sea travelers seeking a good night's rest.": "在船只、礁石、岩石和旧码头上发现的这些腐化的（Blood Barnacles）海藤壁虱绝非自然。通常成群聚集，每组五到十只，血色海藤壁虱的侵袭可能对任何船员构成威胁，尤其是受伤的海上旅行者寻求一个安稳的夜晚休息的时候。",
	"When coagulated blood drops off shambling undead zombies and into the sea, its necrotic blood may turn an ordinary barnacle into a blood barnacle. Large clusters of blood barnacles almost always indicate undead are nearby.": "当凝结的血滴落在摇摇晃晃的不死僵尸身上，然后流入海中时，它的腐烂血液可能会将普通的帆船藤壳变成血藤壳。大群血藤壳几乎总是表明附近有不死生物。",
	"Though a slightly deeper red than most red barnacles, the blood barnacle can often remain undetected among more benign barnacles. It can lie in wait for weeks or months for the perfect injured or heavily bleeding creature before latching onto its prey.": "尽管比大多数红色帆船藤壳略微深红，血藤壳经常在更温和的藤壳中保持不被察觉。它可以等待数周甚至数月，直到找到完美的受伤或大出血的生物，然后才会扑向猎物。",
	"The remains of blood barnacles spawn more of their kind if not disposed of properly. Burning clusters of barnacles or blessing the area is the only way to ensure they don't regrow.": "如果血藤壳的残骸没有得到妥善处理，它们会继续繁殖更多同类。燃烧血藤壳的聚集物或者祝福该区域是确保它们不会重新生长的唯一方法。",
	"Several giant insects with massive mandibles emerge from the water's edge. One rears back on its elongated abdomen and propels itself through the air.": "几只巨大昆虫，带着庞大的大颚，从水边出现。其中一只后退，用其延长的腹部推进自己飞向空中。",
	"Conniption bugs are devasting, predatory giant insects that inhabit bodies of fresh water and the surrounding lowlands.": "狂躁虫是毁灭性的掠食性巨型昆虫，栖息在淡水体和周围低地地区。",
	"These bugs are ferocious, and they try to consume anything within reach. Worse, these predators tend to gather in packs, making travel through their territory particularly dangerous for lone explorers. Their mandibles are viciously barbed and designed to catch and hold prey. Some eccentrics like to keep conniption bugs as pets or disposal systems, and collectors and torturers often find creative uses for the barbed mandibles.": "这些虫子凶猛无比，它们试图吞噬一切接近它们的东西。更糟糕的是，这些捕食者往往聚集成群，对独自探险者在它们的领地中行走尤为危险。它们的大颚非常锋利且设计用于捕捉和固定猎物。一些古怪的人喜欢把(%num%)作为宠物或处理系统，而收藏者和拷打者常常会对这些有刺的大颚发挥创造性的用途。",
	"Conniption bugs are very sensitive to ecological change, including that of magic pollution. The unnatural effect that unrestrained magic can have on the land, whether due to cataclysm or to long-term magic, can cause conniption bugs to mutate rapidly, creating new specimens (see the Scourge Bug sidebar).": "狂躁虫对生态变化非常敏感，包括魔法污染。无节制的魔法对土地的不自然影响，无论是由于灾难还是长期魔法，都可能导致狂躁虫迅速突变，产生新的标本（见《瘟疫虫侧栏》）。",
	"A long, thin vine sprawls across the cliff face. Spindly fronds unfold from the main vine, covered in tiny, dew-tipped stalks. One frond lies curled around the half-digested remains of a bird.": "一根又长又细的藤蔓横跨在悬崖上。从主藤蔓上展开的细长叶片上覆盖着一粒粒带着露珠的茎。一片叶片紧紧缠绕着一只被半消化的鸟的尸体。",
	"Climbing vines are a form of high-altitude plant life, adapted to living above the tree line where few nutrients are available. Clinging to rocky crags, they survive by feeding on whatever animals they can catch. Birds, lizards, insects, and even humanoids who get too close are grabbed by their dew-tipped feelers, crushed by their vines, and slowly digested.": "攀爬藤蔓是一种高海拔植物，适应生长在树线以上的环境，那里的营养物质很少。紧贴在岩石间，它们靠捕食任何接近的动物来生存。鸟类、蜥蜴、昆虫，甚至靠近的人形生物都会被它们带露珠的触须抓住，被藤蔓压碎，然后慢慢消化。",
	"Slow, fragile, and functionally blind, a climbing vine is a foe that is easy to underestimate. Seen from afar, they are trivial to avoid or destroy. However, they tend to hide among less dangerous plants or squeeze into tiny gaps in the rock, nearly invisible from a distance but able to sense vibrations in the air and through the rock via specialized roots. Often, they are imperceptible until they strike, reaching out to grab some unfortunate creature and crush it into easily digestible paste. They are most vulnerable while feeding, when the corpse of their prey limits their options to hide and makes it clear that they are not a harmless plant.": "缓慢、脆弱且功能上视力有限，攀爬藤蔓是一个容易被低估的敌人。从远处看，它们很容易避开或摧毁。然而，它们往往隐藏在较不危险的植物之间或挤进岩石的细小缝隙中，从远处几乎看不见，但能够通过专门的根部感知空气和岩石中的振动。通常，它们在进食时最脆弱，当猎物的尸体限制了它们隐藏的选择，并清楚地表明它们并不是无害的植物。在捕捉到不幸生物并将其压成易于消化的糊状物之前，它们往往是难以察觉的。",
	"While the climbing vines' natural environment is remote, hostile, and unlikely to be seen by most adventurers, they are far more plentiful as purposefully cultivated living traps. Intelligent monsters, isolated hermits, and particularly belligerent mages occasionally grow climbing vines as a self-maintaining security system. A climbing vine attached to a breach in a lair or little-traveled section of a fortress eats vermin and sneaky intruders, keeping the area relatively clean and providing a modicum of security. Though solitary in the wild, climbing vines live in large groups when cultivated. A single vine is little threat to all but the frailest intruder, but a cluster might entangle and devour a relatively hardy foe. They are also a suitably horrible way to dispose of witnesses, sacrifices, or unruly subordinates.": "尽管攀爬藤蔓的自然环境偏远、恶劣，大多数冒险者都不太可能看到它们，但它们作为有意栽培的活捕捉器更为丰富。聪明的怪物、隐居的隐士，尤其是好斗的法师偶尔会种植攀爬藤蔓作为自我维护的安全系统。攀爬藤蔓附着在巢穴中的破口或者堡垒中少有人走动的区域，吞食害虫和偷偷潜入者，保持区域相对清洁并提供一定程度的安全。尽管在野外是孤独的，但栽培时攀爬藤蔓会成群结队。单株藤蔓对除了最虚弱的入侵者以外几乎没有威胁，但一簇藤蔓可能会缠住并吞噬相对强壮的敌人。它们也是处理目击者、祭品或者叛逆下属的适当可怕方式。",
	"Alchemists have an ever-present demand for climbing vines. Their dew is a potent acid commonly used as a reagent or for dilution into acid flasks. Their vines are strong for their size, and the fibers in the vines are used in a variety of strength potions. Some alchemists have specially prepared greenhouses where they maintain and harvest climbing vines, but stories of overrun greenhouses filled with man-eating plants and the remains of unfortunate apprentices lead most to buy what they need from adventurers.": "炼金术士对攀爬藤蔓有着持续不断的需求。它们的露水是一种强效酸，常用作试剂或稀释成酸瓶中的溶液。这些藤蔓在其尺寸范围内非常坚固，藤蔓中的纤维被用于各种强度药剂。一些炼金术士有专门准备的温室，他们在那里种植和收获攀爬藤蔓，但关于被吞噬植物充斥并充满不幸学徒遗骸的温室的故事，使大多数人选择从冒险者那里购买他们所需的东西。",
	"While it resembles a rabbit poised for flight, this childlike creature wears brown trousers and a blue blazer with a small branch of juniper berries pinned to its breast.": "虽然它看起来像一只准备飞跃的兔子，这个孩子般的生物穿着棕色长裤和蓝色西装外套，胸前别着一小枝杜松浆果。",
	"Long ago, fey kings and queens prohibited the juniper sheriffs from telling lies. They also decreed that, whenever a sheriff meets an intelligent creature, the sheriff must ask three questions and hear its answers (or follow it until it does). The fastidious sheriffs follow their instructions, and once every year they visit their ruler's court to report on all they have learned. The rulers record the reports in magical bottles, kept for their own enigmatic purposes.": "很久以前，精灵国王和女王禁止了杜松警长们说谎。他们还颁布法令，规定每当一名警长遇到一个聪明的生物，警长必须提出三个问题并听取它的回答（或者跟随它直到得到答案）。一丝不苟的警长们遵循指示，每年一次他们会拜访他们统治者的法庭，汇报他们所学到的一切。统治者们会把这些报告记录在魔法瓶中，供他们自己神秘的用途。",
	"Juniper sheriffs live on forested mountainsides and foothills, where their namesake juniper trees grow. They protect fairy rings, shadow roads, and fey portals. Sheriffs perform their duties with utmost seriousness, which led other fey to nickname them \"grim guardians.\"": "柏树警长们居住在长满了他们名字来源的柏树的山腰和山麓地带。他们保护着仙子圈、幽影之路和精灵传送门。警长们认真履行自己的职责，这让其他精灵给他们起了一个绰号：“严肃守护者”。",
	"A juniper sheriff never forgets the face, voice, or name of a creature it has spoken to, and it remembers the responses to its questions (if any). Even if a creature has taken another form and speaks with the sheriff years later, a juniper sheriff can often identify it by its voice or by quirks of speech, scent, or body language.": "一位杜松警长永远不会忘记它曾经与之交谈过的生物的面孔、声音或名字，并且它会记住对其提出问题的回答（如果有的话）。即使一个生物已经变成另一个形态并在多年后与警长交谈，杜松警长通常可以通过声音或言语习惯、气味或肢体语言的特点来识别它。",
	"When a creature truthfully answers the juniper sheriff's three questions, it plucks one juniper berry from the branch pinned to its breast, imbuing the berry with a portion of its power. No matter how many a sheriff gives away, it always has more. If a creature given a sheriff's {@item sheriff berry|ToB3|juniper berry} presents the berry to a fey, that fey must accept it and be bound by the authority it represents. The creature that presents the berry is safe from the recipient's attentions for three days. During that time, the fey must not attack, deceive, or hinder the creature in any way. At the GM's discretion, presenting a sheriff's berry to a particularly powerful fey, such as a fey lady or lord, has no effect.": "当一只生物如实回答了杜松树警长的三个问题时，它会从别针别在胸前的树枝上摘下一个杜松果，赋予这个果实一部分它的力量。无论警长赠送了多少个果实，它总是有更多。如果一只生物拿着警长的{@item sheriff berry|ToB3|juniper berry}给予的果实交给一个精灵，那个精灵必须接受它，并受到它代表的权威的约束。呈现果实的生物在接下来的三天内免受接收者的注意。在此期间，精灵不能攻击、欺骗或以任何方式阻碍这只生物。由GM决定，将警长的果实交给特别强大的精灵，如精灵女士或领主，没有任何效果。",

	"Among the wealthy, one popular, though deadly, trend is that of green-painted rooms sourced from arsenic. These trends led to the creation of the first copperkill slime, an ooze formed from the poisonous paint. For curious adventurers, such a ponderous room could mean a much swifter death by ooze rather than poisoning.": "在富人群体中，一种流行的，尽管致命的趋势是使用砷源自的绿色油漆房间。这些趋势导致了第一个铜杀粘液的产生，一种由有毒油漆形成的软泥怪。对于好奇的冒险者来说，这样一个沉重的房间可能意味着更快的死亡，而不是中毒。",
	"Copperkill slimes are relatively docile and have enough sentience to be trained as guardians, provided their keepers maintain a steady supply of food. Ambush predators, copperkill slimes stretch themselves to adhere to walls, pillars, furniture, statues, or similar objects or support structures. As a copperkill slime stretches itself thin to hide, it tinges everything viewed through its transparent form a curious green color. When unsuspecting prey approaches the wall or object, the copperkill slime snaps back into its normal form, spraying poisonous slime on nearby creatures. This poisonous slime slowly kills the prey, and the copperkill slime devours the remains.": "铜杀粘液(Copperkill Slimes)相对温顺，具有足够的感知能力，可以被训练成守护者，只要它们的饲养者保持稳定的食物供应。作为伏击捕食者，铜杀粘液会拉伸自己以附着在墙壁、柱子、家具、雕像或类似物体或支撑结构上。当铜杀粘液将自己拉伸得很薄以隐藏时，它会使透明形态下所看到的一切呈现出一种奇特的绿色。当毫无戒备的猎物靠近墙壁或物体时，铜杀粘液会迅速恢复正常形态，向附近的生物喷射有毒粘液。这种有毒的粘液会慢慢杀死猎物，然后铜杀粘液会吞食残骸。",
	"Dizzying shimmers of light bounce off the mirror-like scales of this reptilian creature. Its powerful jaws part with a hiss, revealing a smile of razor-edged teeth.": "这只爬行动物的镜面般的鳞片反射出令人眼花缭乱的光芒。它强大的下颚发出嘶嘶声，露出一口锋利的牙齿微笑。",
	"Chroma lizards' long, reptilian bodies are supported by short, powerful legs that are ideal for moving undetected through tall savannah grasses. The lizard is covered in reflective, mirror-like scales that provide constant camouflage and dazzle unwitting prey.": "色彩蜥蜴的长长的爬行动物身体由短小而强壮的腿支撑，非常适合在高高的稀树草原中悄无声息地移动。这种蜥蜴覆盖着反光的、镜子般的鳞片，提供持续的伪装并使毫无戒心的猎物眼花缭乱。",
	"Chroma lizards develop their unique chrome-plated scales through a specialized digestive process that extracts minerals readily found in meat. The lizards can extract these minerals from other foods but prefer a carnivorous diet whenever possible. Freshly hatched or poorly nourished chroma lizards have dull scales that don't afford the same protection as healthy scales.": "色彩蜥蜴通过一种专门的消化过程发展出其独特的镀铬鳞片，这个过程提取了肉类中容易找到的矿物质。这些矿物质可以从其他食物中提取，但蜥蜴们尽可能地更喜欢肉食。新孵化的或营养不良的色彩蜥蜴拥有暗淡的鳞片，不像健康鳞片那样提供同样的保护。",

Hunters turn a healthy profit selling chroma hides to armorers and jewelry makers, but savannahdwelling peoples train the lizards as mounts.": "镜面般的鳞片是彩蜥蜴的特色，因其美丽和实用性而备受推崇。猎人们通过将彩蜥蜴皮卖给铠甲制造商和珠宝商赚取可观利润，但居住在草原上的人们则训练这些蜥蜴作为坐骑。",
	"Needing a large intake of prey to maintain their scales, chroma lizards in the wild fight each other for territory or mates. Chroma lizards fight one another with their eyes closed to avoid the reflected light from their opponents. If the lizards see themselves in a reflection, they often shut their eyes out of reflex. Clever hunters use reflective surfaces when hunting chroma lizards to gain the upper hand on the lizards.": "为了维持它们的鳞片，野外的色彩蜥蜴需要大量的猎物。它们为了领地或伴侣而互相搏斗。色彩蜥蜴闭着眼睛互相搏斗，以避免对手反射的光线。如果蜥蜴在反射中看到自己，它们通常会出于本能而闭上眼睛。聪明的猎人在狩猎色彩蜥蜴时会利用反射表面，以获得对蜥蜴的优势。",
	"The odd giant insect plods along a massive tree bough, which dips from its weight. The creature's incredibly long, thin neck has a swivel point in the middle of its length, allowing greater range for its head as it munches the branch's more distant leaves.": "一只奇怪的巨大昆虫沿着一根巨大的树枝缓慢行走，树枝因其重量而下垂。这只生物有着非常长而细的脖子，在其长度的中间有一个旋转点，使其头部在啃食更远处树叶时拥有更大的活动范围。",

Their presence and their compulsive ministrations bring comfort to those around them, creating incredibly lush and thriving habitats. They are typically seen tending their \"crops\" throughout the day, and many oddly placed collections of plants can be attributed to them. They've even been known to maintain herds of giant aphids and similarly docile creatures. Some of the more social creatures, including giant ants and giant bees, encourage the presence of caretaker weevils to ensure the community's vitality. Humanoid farms try to entice and maintain good relations with nearby caretaker weevils in hopes of a prosperous harvest.

With the loss of one source of power, they seek another, feeding on the life blood of living creatures. Such corrupted elementals haunt lonely mountainsides and rocky coastlines, conserving their power, only coming to life when a potential meal strays too close.": "当大地元素精灵被困在物质位面上时，它们会分解，因为失去了与元素力量的联系而变得虚弱。最终，它们会崩溃至虚无，但其中一些土元素精灵即使在崩溃后仍然顽强地维持着生命，通过意志的力量将他们的散落石块和碎砾聚集在一起。失去了一种力量源泉后，它们寻求另一种力量，以生物的生命血为食。这些被腐化的元素精灵游荡在孤寂的山腰和多岩海岸线上，保留着它们的力量，只有当潜在的猎物靠近时才会活跃起来。",
	"A talus flow attempts to take prey by surprise, lying still on a slope of scree and letting creatures move into its vicinity or sliding slowly downslope into attack range, behaving like a natural rockslide until it is close. Once prey is within range, the talus flow becomes a grinding, rumbling engine of destruction.": "一个塌石流试图通过突袭捕食，静静地躺在砾石坡上，让生物靠近它的周围，或者缓慢地滑向攻击范围，表现得像一个自然的山体滑坡，直到接近目标。一旦猎物进入范围，塌石流就会变成一个碾碎、隆隆作响的毁灭机器。",
	"Some remote humanoid communities provide a nearby talus flow with blood sacrifices; sometimes these offerings still live. The talus flow receives a regular supply of energy, while the humanoids gain a protector, or at least remain unscathed. A talus flow receiving such regular offerings can occasionally rebuild itself, becoming a more powerful—but still blood-starved—elemental.": "一些偏远的人形社区会向附近的碎石流提供血祭；有时这些供品仍然活着。碎石流得到了定期的能量补给，而人形生物则获得了一位守护者，或者至少能够安然无恙。接受这种定期供品的碎石流有时会重建自己，变得更加强大——但仍然渴望血液的元素生物。",

	"Giant mantis shrimps are devastating in close-range combat. Their strikes hit with staggering speed, and even if the initial attack misses, the resulting shock wave created by the assault may finish off a target. The shrimp uses this attack to stun prey before tearing it to shreds and devouring the pieces.": "巨型螳螂虾在近距离战斗中具有毁灭性。它们的攻击速度惊人，并且即使最初的攻击未命中，由攻击产生的冲击波可能会结束目标。螳螂虾利用这种攻击来使猎物昏迷，然后撕成碎片并吞食。",

Recently, a number of druids have been working to train wakwaks as mounts and companions for those traversing southern and eastern jungles.": "瓦克瓦克(Wakwaks)主要分布在南地的平原和丛林，以及白海和香料海岸附近的沿海地区。航行于肖卡通道的水手们讲述了关于瓦克瓦克在塞伦德拉附近各个岛屿上的传说。最近，一些德鲁伊一直在努力训练瓦克瓦克，作为南部和东部丛林穿越者的坐骑和伙伴。",
	"An enormous dragonfly blocks out the sun, except for the iridescent shadows filtered through its diaphanous wings. Its three tails gouge into the land like plows before it darts off in a random direction.": "一只巨大的蜻蜓遮住了阳光，除了透过它那透明翅膀的虹彩阴影。它的三根尾巴像犁一样划过土地，然后突然朝一个随机方向飞去。",
	"A full-grown dawnfly is an incredibly rare sight, a massive creature that emerges once every few years and lives for little more than a week. However, it can destroy a vast swathe of crops and homes in that brief period of time.": "一只成年的晨蜻蜓是一种极为罕见的景象，这种巨大的生物每隔几年才会出现一次，而且只能活上不到一周的时间。然而，在这短暂的时间内，它可以摧毁大片农作物和房屋。",
	"A dawnfly starts life as a desolation nymph. Unlike their smaller cousins, which turn into dragonflies, the life cycle of the desolation nymph is complex. Only occasionally do the nymphs mature into giant dragonflies and even then, not until after several years or even decades, as a nymph. Some remain a nymph for the whole of their lives. A nymph that survives at least a decade may transform into the terrifying dawnfly in the final days of its life.": "黎明蜉蝣（(Dawnfly)）的生命始于一只荒凉蛹（(Desolation Nymph)）。与它们会变成蜻蜓的较小表亲不同，荒凉蛹的生命周期是复杂的。只有偶尔有蛹会成长为巨大的蜻蜓，即使如此，也要经过数年甚至几十年的时间。有些蛹一生都停留在蛹的阶段。一个至少存活了十年的蛹可能会在生命的最后阶段变身为可怕的黎明蜉蝣。",

When prey is close, the nymph rapidly extends its lower jaw, arrayed with hooks and spines, to capture and devour its prey.": "荒凉树精们尽力隐藏在红树根或巨型芦苇中；它们更喜欢在水边狩猎。当猎物靠近时，树精会迅速伸出下颚，上面布满了钩子和刺，用来捕捉并吞噬猎物。",
	"The reason for a dawnfly's emergence is a mystery. Some view it as a harbinger of terrible times, or the avatar of any number of gods associated with death and destruction, or the herald of some demon lord or arch-devil associated with insects. All agree that, regardless of its origin, the dawnfly is a powerfully destructive force capable of eliminating entire civilizations.": "黎明蝇的出现原因是一个谜。有些人将其视为可怕时期的先兆，或与死亡和毁灭相关的众多神灵的化身，或与昆虫有关的某位恶魔领主或大恶魔的传令使者。所有人都同意，无论其起源如何，黎明蝇都是一股强大的破坏力量，能够消灭整个文明。",

	"Diopsids are highly intelligent, bug-like aberrations. They are semi-social and dig their small communal homes in intricate tunnel complexes in forests and grasslands not far from civilized lands. They hunt as ambush predators, burying themselves in the loose soil to latch onto unsuspecting prey.

In the meantime, those infected live their short lives as the eyes and ears of these strange creatures.": "Diopsids（(Diopsids)）是高度智能的虫类畸变体。它们半社会化，将自己的小型公共住所挖在森林和草原附近复杂的隧道系统中。它们作为伏击捕食者狩猎，埋藏在松软的土壤中，等待不知情的猎物靠近。它们也通过这种方式繁殖；被捕获的人形生物会被注入一种魔法毒液，最终会转变成另一个Diopsid。与此同时，被感染者会以这些奇怪生物的眼睛和耳朵的身份度过短暂的生命。",
	"Diopsids often co-opt the senses of envenomed victims to observe humanoid culture and interactions.

An ice urchin might work as a guardian, using its bulk to block a passage or entrance, or it may work as a courier, delivering packages swiftly over snowy terrain.": "冰海胆具有一定的智慧，可以通过定期喂食来说服它们提供服务。一只冰海胆可以作为守卫工作，利用其体型阻挡通道或入口，也可以作为信使，在雪地上迅速递送包裹。",
	"Dragons in cold regions prey upon ice urchins and may keep some in their lairs. If a dragon eats an ice urchin, the dragon absorbs its elemental energy.

	"With their stealth and mobility, rochades can switch places with opponents using minor teleportation magic.

	"Rochades are masterful thieves and scavengers, but are not discriminating in their thefts. They grab whatever valuables they can and get out of the reach of their pursuers as quickly as possible. Usually they take practical items, such as food and tools, rather than gems or gold; the elusive creatures pose more of a nuisance than a threat to most underground travelers.": "洛查德（Rochades）是精明的小偷和清道夫，但在偷窃行为上并不挑剔。他们会抓取任何有价值的东西，然后尽快躲开追捕者的追踪。通常他们拿走的是实用物品，比如食物和工具，而不是宝石或黄金；这些难以捉摸的生物对大多数地下旅行者而言更像是一种麻烦而非威胁。",
	"This pale, flabby, leech-like creature props itself up on two thin arms. Its smooth, eyeless head is mostly a mouth containing rings of needle teeth.": "这种苍白、松软、类似水蛭的生物用两只细长的手臂支撑着自己。它光滑无眼的头部主要是一个满是针齿环的大嘴。",

Its gaunt body is masked in well-tailored finery, and its immense mouth is curled up in a mocking sneer. The jewel-feathered wings protruding from its temples flap madly to keep it aloft.": "这种生物最显著的特征是它那超大的头部——再加上细长的脖子和狭窄的身躯，看起来就像一个南瓜威胁着要从脆弱的藤蔓上脱落。它那消瘦的身体被精心裁剪的华丽服饰所掩盖，巨大的嘴角上扬，露出嘲弄的冷笑。从太阳穴上伸出的宝石羽翼疯狂地拍打着，使其能够在空中飞翔。",
	"Veritigibbets can be found in all the lands of the fey, asking probing (and often embarrassing) questions of every creature they meet. An encounter with one of the creatures often begins innocently enough, with the veritigibbet paying a compliment and asking a simple question or two, such as asking for a name or occupation, or commenting on the weather. However, veritigibbets are deeply interested in the secret lives of other creatures, and their questions get personal very quickly. Creatures that don't mind impertinent questions can do very well in conversation with a veritigibbet, as the chatty creatures often sprinkle the conversation with bits they've learned from others.": "在仙境的所有土地中都可以找到真相精灵，他们向每个遇到的生物提出探究性的（通常是令人尴尬的）问题。与这些生物的相遇通常开始得很无害，真相精灵会恭维并问一两个简单的问题，比如询问名字或职业，或者评论天气。然而，真相精灵对其他生物的秘密生活非常感兴趣，他们的问题很快就会变得很私人。不介意被冒犯性问题的生物在与真相精灵的对话中会表现得很好，因为这些健谈的生物经常会在对话中加入他们从他人那里学到的一些信息。",
	"The rulers of the fey find veritigibbets to be adequate inquisitors and spy-catchers and they bond as many of the creatures to their causes as possible. Veritigibbets who have been bonded to a fey lord earn a modicum more respect than their unaligned peers, but most fey treat veritigibbets with grudging respect at best. Most fey find them to be loathsome tattlers and gossips.": "精灵的统治者发现维里提吉贝特(`Veritigibbets`)是足够好的审讯者和间谍追踪者，他们会将尽可能多的这些生物绑定到自己的事业中。那些被绑定到精灵领主身边的维里提吉贝特会比那些没有归属的同类获得更多尊重，但大多数精灵对待维里提吉贝特最多也只是勉强尊重。大多数精灵认为它们是可恶的告密者和爱说闲话的人。",

	"There have been many attempts to domesticate hippopotamuses, either as beasts of burden or livestock. Some druids have made them loyal through nature magic, but even these hippos are compliant only as long as the magic continues. The symbiotic relationships and long-term loyalty druids enjoy with other animals are pointedly missing. Mundane attempts at domestication have universally failed, occasionally with unfortunate side effects. Hippos introduced to river and marshlands far beyond their natural range by would-be ranchers or ambitious warlords keeping them as \"pets\" have made the waters more dangerous for anyone traveling there.": "有许多尝试过驯养河马，无论是作为载重畜力还是家畜。一些德鲁伊通过自然魔法使它们忠诚，但即使是这些河马也只有在魔法持续的情况下才会顺从。德鲁伊与其他动物享有的共生关系和长期忠诚度明显缺失。普通的驯养尝试普遍失败，有时会带来不幸的副作用。被冒险牧场主或雄心勃勃的军阀带到远离它们自然分布范围的河流和沼泽地的河马，使那里的水域变得更加危险，对于任何前往那里的人来说。",
	"Some hippopotamuses ascend to a divine state upon their deaths, gaining gold markings on their hide and often growing to even greater size. Scholars have yet to pinpoint the reason particular hippopotamuses are chosen for ascension.

The divine blessings do nothing to change the animals' territorial attitudes.": "一些河马在死后会升华为神圣状态，身上会出现金色斑纹，体型通常也会变得更加庞大。学者们尚未确定为何会选择特定的河马进行升华。这些神圣的河马是庙宇和圣地的守护神，在河马普遍出现的地区，有时祭司会与这些神圣的河马和谐共处在庙宇和神殿中，尽管有时这些地点会被遗弃或偏远。神圣的祝福并不能改变这些动物的领地态度。",

Some treasure-hunters trade with diving gels, offering copper coins for gold or interesting scales for ancient treasures, but many colonies simply take the offered item without offering anything in return.": "潜水凝胶会聚集在那些闪闪发光的物体附近。在水下环境中，这通常是沉没的宝藏，但凝胶们无法区分有价值的小玩意和闪亮的垃圾。尽管它们的藏品可以填满整个房间，有数十只潜水凝胶盯着它们的宝藏全神贯注地看着，但这些藏品通常充满了五颜六色的石头、闪亮的鱼鳞，以及生锈的锁和门把手，而不是真正的宝藏。更糟糕的是，潜水凝胶像龙一样保护这些小玩意，殴打潜入者和窒息闯入者。一些寻宝者会与潜水凝胶交易，用铜币换取金币或有趣的鳞片换取古代宝藏，但许多群体只是拿走提供的物品而不付出任何回报。",

	"Due to their boundless curiosity and hope for an easy meal, squirrels explore any thinning boundary between planes. Without protective wards or stable portals, though, beasts that make such trips often absorb extraplanar energies. Most creatures eventually die from absorbing such energies, but occasionally, one is permanently altered by them instead. The ember glider is one such creature, a squirrel infused with energies from the Plane of Fire. Infused with this energy, these squirrels are larger and much more formidable than their mundane cousins, and the fire's chaotic influence makes them quick to challenge any interloper in their territory.": "由于它们无穷的好奇心和对易餐的希望，松鼠会探索任何两个平面之间变薄的边界。然而，没有保护性结界或稳定传送门的情况下，进行这种旅行的生物通常会吸收到外域能量。大多数生物最终会因吸收这些能量而死亡，但偶尔也会有一些生物被永久性地改变。火焰滑翔者就是这样一种生物，是一只被火焰位面能量注入的松鼠。这些松鼠因为这股能量而变得更大、比它们平凡的堂兄弟更加强大，而火焰的混乱影响使它们迅速挑战任何侵入它们领地的人。",
	"Given their increased size and the heat they emit, most ember gliders eschew trees and dwell in rocky outcroppings, cliffs, or hilltops.

Its physical prowess offers it little protection from larger predators, especially giants who prize the taste of its flesh.": "云蹄刺客，又称推挤羊或恃强牛，有着不同寻常的食谱，以腐肉为主。虽然它栖息的阴险山脉提供了丰富的食物，但这只羊可以自给自足，通过猎杀从危险高处摔下的不谨慎的猎物。它等待猎物因摔落而受伤致死，然后吞食残骸。它的身体力量几乎无法保护它免受更大的捕食者的侵袭，尤其是那些喜欢其肉味的巨人。",
	"When on the prowl for prey, a cloudhoof assassin chooses a solitary target, which it follows from a distance. Those unknowledgeable about the sheep may mistake the animal's tactic as overcoming its fear of the traveler for the traveler's food or out of curiosity. It chews on anything its target discards while it maintains its separation, aiding the ruse. The cloudhoof assassin remains patient as it waits for its prey to move close to a dangerous drop and lose focus on the animal. When it gauges the right moment, it suddenly speeds toward its target to push it off the edge. If it fails to shove its target, it tries to bludgeon the creature to death or scamper away along a hard-to-follow path, depending on how hungry it is.": "在寻找猎物时，一只云蹄刺客会选择一个孤立的目标，然后从远处跟踪。对于不了解这种羊的人来说，可能会误解动物的策略是克服对旅行者的恐惧，或者是为了旅行者的食物或出于好奇心。它会嚼食目标丢弃的任何东西，同时保持距离，以帮助欺骗。云蹄刺客会耐心等待，直到猎物靠近危险的悬崖边，并且失去对动物的注意力。当它判断时机成熟，突然加速冲向目标，将其推下悬崖。如果未能推开目标，它会试图用重击将生物打死，或者沿着难以追踪的路径逃走，这取决于它有多饥饿。",
	"Other than their small family groups, cloudhoof assassins aggressively protect their mountains from other such sheep. Young cloudhoof assassins often leave their families and move to other mountains where they can start their own families or challenge one or both of their parents for dominion. Challenges between cloudhoof assassins take place along mountainsides, where the winner pushes the loser over an edge and kills it.": "除了它们小的家庭群外，（云蹄刺客） aggressively 保护它们的山脉，不让其他同类羊群接近。年轻的（云蹄刺客）经常离开它们的家庭，搬到其他山脉，开始自己的家庭，或者挑战它们的父母中的一方或两方来争夺统治权。 （云蹄刺客）之间的挑战发生在山腰上，胜者会把败者推下悬崖并杀死它。",

	"The vanguard's unique transformation grants it powerful jaws and claws that are longer than most vampires. Vanguards put these to good use because, unlike other vampires, they cannot regenerate wounds without drinking blood or eating flesh. The vanguards survive their own wounds only if they fight and devour their opponents.": "先锋的独特变身赋予了它强大的下颚和比大多数吸血鬼更长的爪子。先锋们充分利用这些特点，因为与其他吸血鬼不同，他们不能在不喝血或吃肉的情况下恢复伤口。只有当先锋们战斗并吞噬对手时，他们才能存活自己的伤口。",

	"While they resemble a bed of lotus flowers blooming atop a bog's surface, the dozen or so fang-tipped tendrils of a mortifera are much more dangerous.

	"Imperators possess an intellect that surpasses the average animal. While their intelligence doesn't rival most humanoids, they have both a deep cunning and a measure of psychic ability. Imperators can communicate with local penguin populations and even control the penguins' behavior.

In times of extreme need, they devour smaller penguins as an emergency food source.": "帝王兽拥有超越普通动物的智力。虽然它们的智力不及大多数类人生物，但它们既具有深厚的狡诈，又具有一定的心灵能力。帝王兽可以与当地企鹅群体交流，甚至控制企鹅的行为。在某些情况下，它们将当地群体融合成一个庞大的殖民地，用作个人军队来攻击和驱赶捕食者和其他闯入者。在极端需要时，它们会将较小的企鹅吞食作为紧急食物来源。",
	"Some coastal humanoids treat an imperator as a minor god or nature spirit, considering its appearance an omen and offering sacrifices in hopes of good fortune. However, most humanoids dread any sign of them, because their ravenous appetites can spell disaster for other creatures.

Whether in icy water or on land, it prefers to hide with only its tail visible, pouncing when its prey takes a bite of the wiggling tail.": "冰川爬行者是冰盖和寒冷的深海岸线的猎手。在海洋中，它们寻找任何可以捕食的猎物，更喜欢大型、温血动物，如北极熊、独角鲸和海象。当水生猎物变得稀缺时，它们会冒险进入内陆，穿越冰川流和冰原进行狩猎。爬行者的身体散发出一种超热、酸性的黏液，帮助它穿过冰层。无论是在冰冷的水中还是在陆地上，它都喜欢隐藏，只露出尾巴，当猎物咬住摇摆的尾巴时，它就会扑过去。",
	"The glacial crawler is a creature of the deep ocean. Spawned in the lightless depths, it makes its way to more abundant food near the surface. When sightings of a glacial crawler cease for a time, the creature has returned to the deeps to spawn more of its kind.": "冰川爬行者是深海生物。在无光深渊中孵化，它会前往表面附近更丰富的食物区域。当冰川爬行者一段时间内不再被发现时，这意味着它已经返回深海孵化更多同类。",

	"Tuberkith are root vegetables given sentience by fey magic. After a rural village offended the local fey court, its unseelie ruler condemned the villagers to watch their year's harvest uproot itself and walk away, leaving them to starve. Potatoes, beets, yaro, and yams crawled free from the soil and strolled about the village.": "糖根( Tuberkith )是由精灵魔法赋予灵性的根茎蔬菜。在一个乡村村庄冒犯了当地的精灵法庭后，其不祥的统治者宣判村民目睹他们一年的收成自行拔起并离开，让他们挨饿。马铃薯、甜菜根、亚洛( yaro )和山药从土壤中爬出，漫步在村庄周围。",
	"The fey lord's curse did not work out as intended: Instead of fleeing into the surrounding wilderness, the tuberkith became quite social. They exhibited a natural predisposition for managing crops and happily supported the villagers' farming efforts in growing additional food. The tuberkith settled among the villagers and formed families, becoming a blessing in the long run.": "精灵领主的诅咒并没有按照预期的方式发挥作用：土贝基斯（tuberkith）并没有逃入周围的荒野，相反，它们变得非常社交化。它们展现出自然的管理作物的倾向，并乐意支持村民们种植额外的食物。土贝基斯定居在村民中间，组建家庭，最终成为一种祝福。",

	"Like other cultures, tuberkith have developed weapons to defend themselves from predators and foes. The tuberkith wield two-handed mashers, which can knock their foes to the ground, while allies use one-handed peelers to effortlessly slice flesh from the prone enemies.": "与其他文化一样，土贝基人发展了武器来保护自己免受捕食者和敌人的侵害。土贝基人使用双手重型捣击器，可以将敌人击倒在地，而盟友则使用单手削皮刀轻松地从倒地的敌人身上剥下肉。",
	"When five or more tuberkith settle in an area and work farmland, planting and harvesting crops, for at least one season, the plants within 5 miles of the tuberkith's farm become healthier and enriched. Such plants are immune to nonmagical blights, diseases, and poisons, and they have advantage on saving throws against magical blights, diseases, and poisons.

	"Cult leaders, particularly of cults of the Void, often summon leashed lesions as protective mounts. These cultists place themselves or a valued subordinate spellcaster within the lesion's recess, helping the monster fend of threats and healing the rider in the midst of combat.

Often too late, cultists discover that an unhappy leashed lesion is just as likely to kill its rider as protect it.": "在Void（虚空）教派中，邪教领袖经常召唤被拴绳的病变体作为保护坐骑。这些邪教徒会将自己或受重视的下属法师放置在病变体的凹处，帮助怪物抵御威胁并在战斗中治疗骑乘者。这种安排让病变体得名，因为猎怪者经常认为它们不过是邪教领袖的被拴宠物。往往为时已晚，邪教徒发现，一个不高兴的被拴病变体同样可能杀死它的骑乘者，而不是保护它。",
	"Native to twisted worlds in the space between the stars, wild lesions occasionally wander through rents in reality at the site of ancient rituals or destructive magic. Such lesions don't distinguish the wildlife of their new home from the aberrations of their old one and swiftly cycle through potential riders and devour meals as they seek creatures worthy of being symbiotically bound to them. Villages have seen farmers and herds of livestock drained to desiccated husks by wild or lost lesions.": "在星际之间扭曲世界中的本地，野生病变偶尔会穿越现实的裂缝漫游，出现在古老仪式或破坏性魔法的地点。这些病变不会区分新家园的野生动植物和旧家园的畸变生物，它们会迅速循环潜在的骑手并寻找值得与之共生的生物，同时吞食食物。村庄曾见证过农民和牲畜被野生或迷失的病变吸干成干瘪的躯壳。",

	"Ragecasters are spellcasters born among trollkin clans. Like many spellcasters, ragecasters display their magical gifts at a young age, but then their great tempers begin to show.

Once a trollkin child shows the signs of being a ragecaster, it is given to the clan's shaman to learn to control of its magic and temper safely away from others.": "愤怒施法者是出生在巨魔亲族部落中的法术施法者。和许多法术施法者一样，愤怒施法者在年幼时展现出他们的魔法天赋，但随后他们的强烈脾气开始显现。这些脾气导致了毁灭性的事件：孩子所住的小屋被闪电击中，惹怒孩子的村民着火，孩子哭泣时树木倒下等等。一旦一个巨魔孩子显示出成为愤怒施法者的迹象，便会被交给部落的萨满学习如何安全地控制自己的魔法和脾气，远离他人。",
	"Many trollkin clans believe ragecasters are the result of a curse put upon all trollkin after some ancient clan broke an oath to a powerful being.

It floats through the arctic sky, searching for living beings, which it attempts to herd into isolated areas, such as ice caves and ravines. There, it corners its prey, snuffing out their life forces.": "也许是因为它没有自己永久的物质形态，午夜太阳最渴望的就是扑灭其他生物的生命。它漂浮在北极的天空中，寻找着活物，试图把它们赶到孤立的地区，比如冰洞和峡谷。在那里，它把猎物逼入绝境，扼杀它们的生命力。",

But when the opportunity presents itself for a live meal, such as an unaware straggler in a mountain expedition, caldera kites eagerly swoop in for a bite. The toxic dust cloud that pervades the air around them obscures their approach, and they can further agitate the cloud and mix in some of their trapped gases to create a haze that withers everything it touches. Once prey has been thoroughly poisoned, a caldera kite aims to suck up the creature in its large proboscis and carry the victim off to the safety of the skies where it can enjoy its meal.": "卡尔德拉风筝是以清道夫为首选，它们在所居住的超热景观边缘搜寻植被、死亡或垂死生物，或者是被误入的探险者留下的残羹剩饭。但当机会出现，比如山地探险队中的一个毫无防备的落伍者，卡尔德拉风筝会迫不及待地俯冲下来享用一顿活生生的大餐。围绕它们的有毒尘埃云遮蔽了它们的接近，它们还可以进一步搅动云层，混入一些困住的气体，制造一片接触到的一切都会枯萎的薄雾。一旦猎物被彻底毒害，卡尔德拉风筝就会瞄准用其大吸管吸食生物，并将受害者带到天空的安全地带享用美餐。",

	"Snatch bats are incorrigible kleptomaniacs, and each has preferences about what it steals. Checking the contents of a snatch bat's belly after an encounter can be as delightfully surprising as it is gross. Scholars still puzzle over whether snatch bats subsist on actual meat or on the act of thievery itself. Interested parties have followed snatch bat flight patterns, hoping for insight into what drives them and their erratic tendencies. Such endeavors are often fraught with peril and most \"successful\" expeditions have yielded only worthless trinkets.": "抢夺蝙蝠是无法无天的偷窃癖者，每只都有自己偏好的偷窃对象。在与抢夺蝙蝠相遇后检查其肚子的内容，可能会让人既惊喜又恶心。学者们仍在纳闷，抢夺蝙蝠到底是以实际的肉食为生，还是以偷窃行为本身为生。感兴趣的人一直追踪抢夺蝙蝠的飞行路线，希望能洞悉它们的动机和不规律的倾向。这样的努力往往充满危险，大多数“成功”的探险只带来一些毫无价值的小玩意。",

If the threat was an edible creature, it then eats the threat.": "巨型鼹蜥是一种极不加区分的杂食动物。这种蜥蜴会吃任何能塞进它嘴里且不反抗的东西。腐烂的食物、废物，甚至尸体都在它的觅食范围之内。虽然不具攻击性，一只巨型鼹蜥会用它的爪子撕裂被视为威胁的东西，或者用它庞大的身躯压制威胁。如果这个威胁是一种可食用的生物，它会将其吞食。",
	"Giant mole lizards are partially domesticated, and {@creature lizardfolk}, {@creature derro|MPMM}, {@creature goblin||goblins}, and other humanoids yoke them as beasts of burden in underground cities or deep swamps where they're a convenient alternative to oxen and mules. They pull wagons, turn mills, and carve tunnels where other animals can't. The lizards' prodigious strength lets them pull carts and sleds straight through swamps that would mire a horse-drawn wagon, while their digging ability makes them invaluable for transport between underground settlements where cave-ins and shifting earth are a constant concern. However, giant mole lizards are slow and can become sick if exposed to direct sunlight too often, limiting where they can be taken.

The ridges on their back absorb the light of the sun, glowing ever-more-brightly as they charge, and slowly dimming as the jackal tires or spits flame. Travelers in scorchrunner territory fear cloudless days and high noon, when the jackals are at the height of their power. During the night, scorchrunners retreat to hidden dens, both to avoid conflict and to reserve their power until the sun rises again. In areas with harsh winters, scorchrunners are a seasonal threat, because frequent cloud cover, low temperatures, and long nights forces them to hibernate or hunter less actively for long months.": "炎奔豺狼（Scorchrunner jackals）利用白天的阳光来激发他们的魔法能力。它们背部的脊脊吸收太阳的光线，随着它们的冲锋而变得越来越明亮，当豺狼疲倦或喷火时慢慢变暗。在炎奔豺狼领地内旅行的人们害怕晴朗的日子和正午时分，因为那时豺狼处于最强大的状态。夜晚时，炎奔豺狼会撤退到隐藏的巢穴中，既是为了避免冲突，也是为了保留他们的力量，直到太阳再次升起。在气候寒冷的地区，炎奔豺狼是一个季节性的威胁，因为频繁的云层遮蔽、低温和长夜迫使它们冬眠或在漫长的几个月内减少狩猎活动。",
	"Scorchrunner jackals are deeply social creatures and live in packs of up to eight adults and their pups. While territorial toward perceived threats, they are more than willing to share territory with other scorchrunner packs and creatures that have a mutualistic relationship with them. Scorchrunner packs have been observed helping wyverns, manticores, and griffons tackle difficult prey, then eating whatever the larger predator leaves behind. On rarer occasions, packs have shared a hydra's lair, protecting its eggs during the winter, and bringing back excess meat for their massive roommate during the summer.": "炎奔狼群是深度社会性动物，生活在由多达八只成年狼和它们的幼崽组成的群体中。虽然对被视为威胁的入侵者具有领土意识，但它们也愿意与其他炎奔狼群和与它们建立互利关系的生物分享领地。观察发现，炎奔狼群会帮助飞龙、蝎尾狮和狮鹫捕捉困难的猎物，然后吃掉较大掠食者留下的残羹剩饭。在更为罕见的情况下，狼群会与一头多头蛇共用巢穴，在冬季保护它的蛋，并在夏季为它们庞大的室友带回多余的肉食。",

Even intelligent creatures aren't immune to the shire giants' will, as the giants occasionally declare a village part of their livestock, extracting regular tribute in treasure, goods, or food. These tributes aren't always one-sided, and many shire giant farmsteads send these villages surplus goods or goods they can't use or don't want.

They lumber into battle, impaling smaller opponents with their pitchforks while grabbing and flinging tougher foes away from themselves or into their allies.
