After intense battles, it retreats deep underground for prolonged dormant phases, potentially turning the surface above into an active volcanic region.": "熔岩泰坦（Magma Titan）除了其破坏性质外，在平静时刻，会雕刻复杂的熔岩雕像，作为其经过的怪异标记。当熔岩泰坦静止时，靠近其炽热形体的人可能会听到微弱的耳语、低语，甚至是从其燃烧裂缝中回荡的哭声。有人认为这些是曾被熔岩泰坦吞噬的灵魂的残留，而另一些人则认为这些只是由于强热引起的听觉幻觉。在激烈战斗之后，它会深入地下进入长时间的休眠阶段，有可能使地表变成一个活跃的火山地区。",
