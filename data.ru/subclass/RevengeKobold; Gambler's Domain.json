				"The Gambler's domain favors the reckless and the cunning - those in the world who are willing to place their lives in the hands of chance. The gods of gambling exemplify calculated risks, luck, impulsion, and misdirection. Deities from all alignments can influence this domain, but most have a tendency towards chaos. Gods of luck (such as Avandra, Tyche, and Tymora), trickery (such as Mask, Olidamarra, and Ormet), or patrons of gambling itself (like Norebo, or Olladra) may grant their clerics the Gambler's domain.",
